    Nothing.${prompt}
  8: Hmm...not much work for those wet behind the ears, but...${prompt}

  10: If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.${prompt}
  11: |-
    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me more.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  12: Here's your mission. Orcish scouts roam outside; kill one and bring me his axe as proof.${prompt}
  13: 'You''ll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. No other kind will do. Understand?${prompt}'
  14: That is all. You'll take the mission then?${prompt}

    Do you accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    I accept.
    Could you explain again?
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  16: Bring me one of those axes, and your mission will be a success. No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}
  17: Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt}
  18: 'That''s another ${item-singular: 0[2]} for the armory, then. Mission complete! Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  19: What? I don't want this!${prompt}
  20: Are you really a new recruit!?${prompt}
  21: Listen, before you bring me something, you must first accept the mission! That is how things work around here!${prompt}
  22: Persistent, aren't you? An Orc under the belt does not a hero make! Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt}
  23: Bat patrol! How about it? Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself, no?${prompt}
  24: Here's your mission, then. Clear out bats lurking in King Ranperre's Tomb and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt}
  25: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and your mission will be a success.${prompt}'
  26: Deep in the tomb you'll find Goblins. Take care; I don't want to lose you yet.${prompt}
  27: Ah, you've returned! I was afraid that Goblins got you.${prompt}
  28: 'That''s one ${item-singular: 3[2]} for the gatehouse, then. Mission complete. Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  29: Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt}
  30: Well, perhaps you can be of some help. Many of our children have disappeared mysteriously, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt}
  31: The Royal Knights should be on the job by now, but the two princes are at each other's throats.${prompt}
  32: Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt}
  33: While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt}
  34: They've been arguing this back and forth for days. The knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt}
  35: If you really want to make a name for yourself, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt}
  36: What say you? Will you go?${prompt}
  37: Here's your mission, then. Rescue the two children kidnapped by the Orcs of Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt}
  38: Ghelsba Outpost is northwest of West Ronfaure. Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the entrance up in the hills.${prompt}
  39: If you have trouble finding the way, just follow one of the soldiers on patrol.${prompt}
  40: Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check them first.${prompt}
  41: Ah, you've returned! You were gone so long, I feared a warmachine had got you!${prompt}
  42: At any rate, mission complete! And to reward your accomplishment...${prompt}
  43: I hereby recognize you, ${name-player}, as a certified adventurer of San d'Oria! You're now mission rank two, as well.${prompt}
  44: But don't get too excited. Your title is valid only here in San d'Oria, understand?${prompt}
  45: 'In order to become a true adventurer, and bear ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you must be recognized by Bastok and Windurst as well.${prompt}'
  46: '''Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law. I know it''s hard, but those are the rules.${prompt}'
  47: For now, cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt}
  48: You achieve rank 2!${prompt}
  49: There's not much work in right now. I suppose you could go participate in the Temple Knights' rescue drills out on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  50: Enter the forest beyond the Westgate and head southwest. You'll come out onto the La Theine Plateau before long.${prompt}
  51: Once you're out on the plateau, keep going until you see the knights. The training grounds aren't far from there.${prompt}
  52: It's all just a drill, so this should be easy compared to your usual fare. Just follow orders and you'll be fine.${prompt}
  53: You've returned! I hear the drill turned into something far more perilous. But real battle is the best drill for recruits, in my opinion.${prompt}
  54: Regardless, you've done well. I'll turn to you when there's work to be done, now.${prompt}
  55: 'Here, take this ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Go ahead, you''ve earned it.${prompt}'
  56: This time it's messenger duty. One of our knights is out scouting in a place called Davoi, on the southern edge of Jugner Forest.${prompt}
  57: The Orcs' stronghold is in Davoi, so it's vital that we stop them from massing, or they may launch an assault.${prompt}
  58: Of course, the Orcs are keeping an eye on us, too. Why, just a few days past, a squad of our Royal Knights fell to their axes.${prompt}
  59: We have sent scouts to find a weakness in their defenses. You must find the scout there now, and bring back the latest scouting report.${prompt}
  60: The scout's name is Zantaviat. He's somewhere in Davoi, but where I cannot say.${prompt}
  61: Come back after you've gotten the report. Those lands are no place to wander.${prompt}
  62: You have returned! And you've brought the scouting report. Good work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  63: Troubling news, this is. It says that Orcs are gathering deep inside the encampment. The time to act is coming!${prompt}
  64: But that is not your concern. You've done well today. Mission complete!${prompt}
  65: Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. And at just the right time, too. Monarlais Halver is looking for an adventurer such as yourself.${prompt}
  66: Enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver is there; he'll explain in person.${prompt}
  67: What? You haven't been certified in Bastok and Windurst yet? You may dally, but others are not! Get moving!${prompt}
  68: Ah, welcome back. I see you've been certified in Bastok and Windurst. Good work. You'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt}
  69: What's that, a report for our kingdom? I see. Take that to the monarlais when you go.${prompt}
  70: 'You should receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Monarlais Halver. Now, go to Chateau d''Oraguille and let them know you''re back!${prompt}'
  71: Hurry to Chateau d'Oraguille and give that report to Monarlais Halver!${prompt}
  72: You achieve rank 3!${prompt}
  73: Ah! You've come at just the right time. Zantaviat, one of our scouts in Davoi, needs an adventurer.${prompt}
  74: He wants someone to infiltrate Davoi and scout behind enemy lines. Know anyone fitting that description?${prompt}
  75: 'Now that you''ve got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, this is an opportunity to prove you''re worth it!${prompt}'
  76: The situation in Davoi worsens by the day. This won't be easy, but I can't think of a better adventurer for the job!${prompt}
  77: You've returned! Zantaviat told me everything. Congratulations on a job well done!${prompt}
  78: But we can't let down our guard yet. Those Orcs will not just sit there. We must keep constant vigil, and move before they do!${prompt}
  79: 'Here''s your reward: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You''re becoming quite the adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  80: Welcome back! I have an important mission for you this time. Recently, land is eroding due to crystal formation...and it's getting worse.${prompt}
  81: There's a small spring on the eastern edge of Jugner Forest, called Crystwater Spring. We must know what effect crystal formation has on the wildlife there.${prompt}
  82: 'I want you to get me a fish from the spring. And not just any fish! You need to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  83: Ah, that reminds me--have you any fishing gear? You'll need some for this mission.${prompt}
  84: There are people about that know a thing or two about fishing, should you need help finding and choosing your gear.${prompt}
  85: Ah, the great angler returns! I was worried, to be honest. All you hear these days is the massing of beasts, the erosion of the Crystal Lines, and now...${prompt}
  86: '...rumors that the Shadow Lord himself has returned!${prompt}'
  87: We will examine the fish you brought. Depending on the results, we may need to act! I'll let you know if we need your help.${prompt}
  88: Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. You've come at a good time. I've news for you.${prompt}
  89: By order of the Kingdom of San d'Oria, you're to head to Jeuno as an ambassadorial attaché.${prompt}
  90: Go to Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver will tell you all you need to know.${prompt}

  99: There you are! I've been looking for you. Monarlais Halver requests your presence at the chateau immediately.${prompt}
  100: It sounds as if this is a fairly important mission. I need not remind you that you should take care to properly equip yourself before embarking on this journey.${prompt}
  101: I'm not sure what it's about, but you'd best make haste. The monarlais is not to be kept waiting!${prompt}
  102: Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! This is no time for loafing around, friend! Prince Trion is looking for you.${prompt}
  103: For this next mission, he's requested you personally. You should be honored!${prompt}
  104: As for the details of the mission, I've no idea what he wants, but he was in a hurry. You'd best be off to Chateau d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  105: It is a great thing you've done, ${name-player}! I knew deep in my heart that you were the one for the task.${prompt}
  106: You'd better get to the chateau quick. They're all waiting to welcome you back, I'd wager.${prompt}
  107: You've saved our proud Kingdom of San d'Oria. No, you're the savior of all Vana'diel! There's not a soul that doesn't owe you a great debt, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  108: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    You had best hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille. It seems as if something terrible is in the works there.${prompt}
  109: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Your timing is perfect. The chateau just sent a request for an adventurer.${prompt}
  110: It looks as if this next mission has something to do with the late queen. You should feel honored. It's not every day that an adventurer gets to work directly with the royal family.${prompt}
  111: |-
    Spoken like a true San d'Orian!
    Now hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille and get the details on the mission from Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  112: What's wrong? Dealing with royalty is not your cup of tea? Well, think about it and come back when you've come to your senses.${prompt}
  113: Prince Trion is requesting the aid of an adventurer. How about it?${prompt}
  114: It looks fairly urgent, so you should hurry to the chateau. The prince is waiting in his chambers.${prompt}
  115: I expected more from you, ${name-player}. If you change your mind, return here. I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  116: I have received the details of your mission from Prince Trion. I will deliver this book to the scholars for deciphering.${prompt}
  117: 'The deciphering of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will take a considerable amount of time. Return later for a report.${prompt}'
  118: 'You handed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over to the guard.${prompt}'
  119: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. We've been waiting.
    Prince Trion is calling for you. I wonder if this means the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been completely deciphered.${prompt}
  120: Well done, ${name-player}! I knew you would not let the Kingdom down.${prompt}
  121: I'm proud to increase your rank to 7!${prompt}
  122: The papsque has work for you, ${name-player}. Are you willing to take on the task?${prompt}
  123: Excellent. Proceed to the papsque's chambers on the third floor of the cathedral.${prompt}
  124: The papsque often comes across as a difficult man, but he is actually very kindhearted and compassionate. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.${prompt}
  125: The fair Claidie I d'Oraguille has invited you to the chateau. She wishes for you to see the flowers that have bloomed from the seeds you brought back from Altepa.${prompt}
  126: It is an honor to be invited to the chateau garden. One day you may even have the opportunity to attend one of their royal garden parties.${prompt}
  127: We cannot keep the princess waiting. Now, off to the chateau!${prompt}
  128: A party of Royal Knights stationed in Ghelsba Outpost have reported strange activity by Orcs deep within Yughott Grotto.${prompt}
  129: From your reports, we already know that the beastmen have built a giant portal, but their motives remain unclear.${prompt}
  130: It makes me shudder to think of what those Orcs are planning with that portal...${prompt}
  131: ${name-player}, your next mission is to travel to Ghelsba and continue your investigation into the Orcs' activities.${prompt}
  132: Be on your guard when traveling deep into Yughott Grotto. Losing an adventurer such as yourself would deal a great blow to all of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  133: I see you need more time for preparations. When you are ready, I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  134: It's hard to believe Orcs have their hands on such dangerous equipment. More patrols will have to be sent out to prevent any new developments in their evil plans.${prompt}
  135: 'And this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... We will have to analyze it and begin reproduction for our forces. We cannot let Orcs get the Treasure of the Dragon King before San d''Oria does.${prompt}'
  136: Well, congratulations on the completion of your mission. Hmmm? Do I know of an adventurer named Eideialc? Never heard of him.${prompt}
  137: But you need not worry about some petty traveler. You are in a different league. You are now rank 8!${prompt}
  138: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. This ceremony is an important facet of d'Oraguille tradition.${prompt}
  139: Monarlais Halver has put out a call to high-ranking adventurers for their assistance in Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  140: Ah, the young princess has finally become a lady... Oh, I'm sorry. You can get the details of your next mission from Sir Halver.${prompt}
  141: What? You do not wish to repay the kindness the princess has shown to you in the past months? As you wish...but if you change your mind, you know where to find me.${prompt}
  142: I am busy with preparations for Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony. You don't know what kind of vermin could be roaming the streets and looking for trouble.${prompt}
  143: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is about to begin at the cathedral. I must remain at my post, but why don't you attend?${prompt}
  144: The king has requested your audience. He has selected you from the mountain of adventurers in San d'Oria. You should feel honored!${prompt}
  145: You have matured from a fledgling adventurer into a great asset to our kingdom. Do not let us down.${prompt}
  146: There is no need for modesty at a time like this. The fate of San d'Oria is at stake!${prompt}
  147: The authorities are saying that a dark cloud of despair is looming over the Kingdom. They are asking for the assistance of only the best adventurers.${prompt}
  148: I can think of none more qualified than you. Will you accept this mission?${prompt}
  149: |-
    Then proceed to the Audience Chamber in the Chateau d'Oraguille.
    Word has it that His Highness is not feeling that well. He may not be present for your briefing.${prompt}
  150: ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! The Kingdom is counting on you. Who else, I ask you, is worthy for this task?${prompt}
  151: Ah, a time of great change is upon us. In a matter of days, the Rites of Succession will be held at the cathedral in Northern San d'Oria. It is then that the new heir to the throne will be decided.${prompt}
  152: Due to the unpredictable circumstances that took place at the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, this time, only authorized personnel will be allowed near the proceedings. However, the royal family has requested your services as a guard.${prompt}
  153: Even we Royal Knights have not been granted permission to attend... You must be held in high regard by His Highness. I envy you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am].${prompt}
  154: When you have finished your preparations, proceed directly to the cathedral to report.${prompt}
  155: Off the record, which of the two princes do you think should be the next heir to the throne?${prompt}
  156: |-
    It is a difficult decision, but...
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion is better suited.
    Pieuje is better suited.${prompt}
  157: |-
    Hm...
    Being the oldest, he is the true heir, and many people believe he is the most suited to rule the Kingdom. However, Prince Pieuje's prudent ways may be what this country is lacking.${prompt}
  158: Many think as you do, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. However, what this country may need is someone who will not back down in the face of a threat--someone who will stand up for the pride of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  159: But our opinion is of no matter. Lightbringer will decide who is the most suited to stand over our fine nation. And do not speak a word of today's exchange, for the monarlais will have our heads if he finds out.${prompt}
  160: I realize that you must have many preparations before taking on such an important mission. Take your time and return here when you are ready.${prompt}

  6774: Bien que la recherche de l'épée sainte de Ranperre soit l'une de nos priorités, rendre hommage à notre ancien roi de manière appropriée est quelque chose que je souhaite faire en tant que successeur de son trône.${prompt}
  6775: ${name-player}. Je souhaite que vous vous rendiez au tombeau du Roi Dragon et que vous purifiiez la région de toute vermine. Nous suivrons directement derrière.${prompt}
  6776: Le Prince Trion se prépare pour le voyage au Tombeau du Roi Ranperre. Il m'a demandé de vous dire de vous y rendre et de purger la zone de tout monstre avant leur arrivée.${prompt}
  6777: Je vous félicite pour votre travail sur cette mission. Cependant, vous avez encore une tâche importante à accomplir. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous vers le tombeau et débarrassez la zone de toute vermine qui pourrait se cacher dans l'obscurité.${prompt}
  6778: |-
    Le Prince Trion a laissé un message avec moi :
    “Remettez votre rapport aux gardes à la guérite.”${prompt}
  6779: Je vous félicite pour votre travail sur cette mission. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous à la guérite et rapportez !${prompt}
  6780: Princesse Claidie ! J'ai fini d'arroser les fleurs !${prompt}
  6781: Merci beaucoup, Lourima.${prompt}
  6782: Tu deviens plutôt doué à ça, m'lady. Faudrait faire attention, sinon je pourrais me retrouver au chômage !${prompt}
  6783: Au revoir !${prompt}
  6784: Cette fille ne sortait jamais de sa chambre, mais elle s'est un peu éclaircie depuis que je lui permets de m'aider dans le jardin.${prompt}
  6785: Oui, mais rien de ce que nous pouvons faire ne ramènera ses parents...${prompt}
  6786: Tant qu'il y aura la guerre et les conflits dans Vana'diel, il y aura toujours des petites filles comme Lourima.${prompt}
  6787: Votre Altesse...${prompt}
  6788: 'Ah, ${name-player}. Je t’ai appelé ici pour te remercier en personne d’avoir apporté le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  6789: Tu déploies continuellement tous tes efforts pour le bien de la famille d'Oraguille. Quant à moi, je n'ai pas le pouvoir de récupérer une seule graine.${prompt}
  6790: La princesse voyageant dans d'autres contrées ? Pensez à votre sécurité, Votre Altesse !${prompt}
  6791: Que se passerait-il si San d'Oria se retrouvait dans la même situation que Tavnazia ? Que deviendrais-je alors ? Me contenterais-je d'attendre la destruction du Royaume ?${prompt}
  6792: Votre Altesse...${prompt}
  6793: Il y a vingt ans, les bêtes ont concentré leurs forces à Tavnazia... et puis l'explosion. Il ne restait plus rien...${prompt}
  6794: La péninsule de Tavnazia a été arrachée au continent et est devenue une île.${prompt}
  6795: Quel était le but derrière les actions des bêtes ? Pouvons-nous vraiment laisser quelque chose d'aussi terrible se reproduire ?${prompt}
  6796: Mais que puis-je faire, une princesse enfermée dans un château ? Je t'envie, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  6797: Votre Altesse, ne parlez plus de telles choses. Regardez plutôt les fleurs en fleurs. ${prompt}
  6798: |-
    Vous avez raison, Chalvatot.
    ${name-player}, je m'excuse pour mes paroles. S'il vous plaît, restez et profitez de la beauté des roses des rêves.${prompt}
  6799: Chère Mère... Ma cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte approche. Mes frères me disent que pendant la cérémonie, on me révélera tous les secrets de la famille d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  6800: J'ai entendu dire que la même tradition était pratiquée à Tavnazia. Mère, quels secrets vous ont été révélés ? Saurai-je supporter le fardeau comme vous l'avez fait ?${prompt}
  6801: Je vous en supplie, Mère. Veillez sur moi en ces temps difficiles.${prompt}
  6802: ${name-player}, je suppose qu'un aventurier de votre stature a entendu les rumeurs sur la cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte de la princesse Claidie.${prompt}
  6803: Cette cérémonie est une pièce de la tradition d'Oraguille et nécessite beaucoup de préparation. C'est là que votre assistance est nécessaire.${prompt}
  6804: 'Rendez-vous à la Fontaine des Rois située dans les Grottes de Sable mouvant, et ramenez ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  6805: La princesse parle toujours de vos exploits pour le Royaume. Tout le monde ici compte sur vous, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  6806: 'Rendez-vous à la Fontaine des Rois située dans les Grottes de Sable mouvant, et ramenez ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. La princesse compte sur vous, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  6807: Alors, ma jeune sœur est enfin parvenue à l'âge adulte... Je me souviens quand mon frère et moi sortions en douce du château et parcourions la ville pour acheter des cadeaux pour elle.${prompt}
  6808: Nous étions toujours émerveillés par les merveilles de la ville.${prompt}
  6809: Une année, le roi nous a surpris en train de sortir en douce. Notre mère a essayé de parler à notre père, mais rien n'a pu apaiser sa colère. C'est alors que j'ai eu peur pour la première fois de mon père.${prompt}
  6810: Notre mère est tombée malade peu après, et ni mon frère ni moi n'avons pu la sauver. Peut-être que notre incapacité à sauver notre mère nous a rendus ennemis...${prompt}
  6811: Je m'excuse pour mon bavardage. Peut-être devrais-je partir en ville et choisir le cadeau de ma sœur...${prompt}
  6812: |-
    Claidie est enfin parvenue à l'âge adulte...
    Ma sœur et moi n'avons pas beaucoup de souvenirs de la reine, mais à chaque fois que je vois Claidie, je sens une partie de ma mère en elle.${prompt}
  6813: Je ne sais pas... C'est probablement parce qu'elles se ressemblent et agissent de la même manière.${prompt}
  6814: Malgré avoir été élevée sans mère aux côtés de deux frères aînés, elle est devenue une femme fine et belle. C'est maintenant son moment de briller.${prompt}
  6815: 'Ah, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Ces objets étaient utilisés lors des cérémonies des princes également.${prompt}'
  6816: La tradition nous interdit de vous permettre d'assister à la cérémonie, mais n'hésitez pas à la regarder. La princesse serait ravie de votre présence.${prompt}
  6817: Appelez tous les membres de la cour. L'aventurier ${name-player} est-il arrivé ?${prompt}
  6818: Ah, ${name-player}. Le déchiffrage de la tablette de pierre que vous avez trouvée a été achevé.${prompt}
  6819: Il y a une ligne qui nous intrigue particulièrement...${prompt}
  6820: “La lumière tombera sur la grande Vana'diel uniquement lorsque le véritable héritier d'Oraguille brandira Lightbringer vers les cieux.”${prompt}
  6821: Et cela signifie...${prompt}
  6822: Cela signifie que seul le véritable héritier du trône d'Oraguille pourra dégainer Lightbringer, et que seulement quand il le fera, la véritable puissance de l'épée sera libérée.${prompt}
  6823: Alors c'est décidé. Lorsque nous aurons possession de l'épée légendaire, Trion et Pieuje tenteront tous deux de la dégainer.${prompt}
  6824: Celui qui réussira prendra ma place sur le trône en tant que véritable héritier de la Maison d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  6825: '!!!${prompt}'
  6826: L'héritier...véritable ?${prompt}
  6827: Trion ou Pieuje -- l'épée décidera du futur de San d'Oria et nous conduira hors des ténèbres. Bien sûr, nous devons d'abord localiser le Trésor du Roi Dragon.${prompt}
  6828: |-
    Rahal. Curilla.
    Je veux que vos chevaliers concentrent leurs efforts sur la recherche de Lightbringer.${prompt}
  6829: Oui, Votre Altesse.${prompt}
  6830: Bien compris, Votre Altesse.${prompt}
  6831: |-
    Et ${name-player}.
    Rapportez-vous à Rahal pour vos ordres. Je suis convaincu que votre implication dans cette enquête ne peut que bénéficier à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  6832: Partez et explorez les ténèbres à la recherche de la lumière qui nous guidera vers un avenir plus radieux. L'aube d'une nouvelle ère à San d'Oria est sur nous !${prompt}
  6833: ${name-player}, je veux que vous enquêtiez sur le Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}
  6834: 'Prenez ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec vous dans votre voyage.${prompt}'
  6835: 'Utilisez-le lors de la recherche dans la région. Toute réponse du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} pourrait être un indice sur l’emplacement de Lightbringer. Le destin du Royaume repose sur vos épaules. Ne nous décevez pas !${prompt}'
  6836: N'oubliez pas, cette mission est une question de sécurité nationale. Lorsque vous aurez terminé votre enquête, faites votre rapport directement au roi.${prompt}
  6837: On m'a affecté à l'enquête sur une île isolée à l'ouest de la côte de Vollbow. Ce sera la première fois que je quitte San d'Oria depuis que j'étais un chevalier en formation.${prompt}
  6838: |-
    Donc, vous n'avez pas pu localiser Lightbringer...
    Eh bien, à notre grande surprise, les forces expéditionnaires de Curilla sont rentrées hier avec l'épée.${prompt}
  6839: Bienvenue de votre long voyage, ${name-player}. Je suis heureux de vous annoncer que les forces de Curilla ont localisé l'épée sainte, Lightbringer.${prompt}
  6840: Selon les écrits de nos anciens livres, les érudits estiment que l'épée récupérée est vraiment le Trésor perdu du Roi Dragon.${prompt}
  6841: Le chemin menant à ce jour a été long et périlleux. Cependant, notre voyage est presque terminé. Je n'ai pas les mots pour exprimer ma gratitude pour vos services.${prompt}
  6842: Je vous remercie, et souhaite que vous puissiez continuer votre travail pour le bien de San d'Oria bien après que j'aie quitté le trône.${prompt}
  6843: Cependant, une dernière cérémonie doit avoir lieu -- le véritable héritier de la Maison d'Oraguille doit être décidé. À ce moment-là, vos services seront à nouveau sollicités.${prompt}
  6844: Nous avons localisé Lightbringer sur une petite île isolée au large de la côte de Vollbow.${prompt}
  6845: Autrefois partie de Vollbow, l'île a été arrachée du continent par la force des terribles armes des bêtes. Maintenant, la zone n'est rien de plus qu'un désert.${prompt}
  6846: Quand j'ai pris l'épée dans mes mains, j'ai pu sentir quelque chose à l'intérieur. À ce moment-là, j'ai su que je tenais la véritable épée du Roi Ranperre.${prompt}
  6847: Pour vous dire la vérité, j'avais mes doutes sur le Trésor du Roi Dragon, mais Curilla a réussi à le trouver. Pourtant, je suis contrarié par cela -- pourquoi l'épée était-elle sur cette île ?${prompt}
  6848: Lightbringer a été trouvé ! C'est le jour le plus heureux de mon mandat en tant que monarque !${prompt}
  6849: Grâce à votre persévérance et à votre engagement envers le Royaume, Lightbringer a été trouvé, et maintenant les Rites de Succession peuvent être effectués.${prompt}
  6850: Tant que le Trésor est à San d'Oria, le Royaume sera en sécurité -- peu importe que moi-même ou mon frère soit le véritable héritier du trône.${prompt}
  6851: Les Rites de Succession auront lieu bientôt. À ce moment-là, vos services seront à nouveau requis.${prompt}
  6852: Je ne m'imaginais jamais devenir roi. Ce royaume a besoin du leadership de mon frère pour la rassembler.${prompt}
  6853: Mais elle a aussi besoin de quelqu'un pour prendre le contrôle lorsque mon frère va trop loin.${prompt}
  6854: Si par hasard Lightbringer me choisit, je ne sais pas si je pourrai empêcher l'histoire sanglante de San d'Oria de se répéter.${prompt}
  6855: Le Trésor du Roi Dragon possède-t-il vraiment le pouvoir de gouverner un royaume ? Ne lisons-nous pas trop dans la légende ? Seul le temps apportera une réponse à mes craintes.${prompt}
  6856: Oh, c'est vous. Comment ça se passe avec votre wyverne ?${prompt}
  6857: |-
    Comment ça va ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nous sommes des compagnons loyaux.
    Pas aussi bien que je le voudrais.${prompt}
  6858: Excellent. Je n'ai jamais douté de votre succès.${prompt}
  6859: Je vois... Cependant, si vous continuez à lui donner de l'attention, votre wyverne finira par s'ouvrir à vous. Ils prospèrent grâce à l'affection.${prompt}
  6860: Sur une note plus sérieuse, les Chevaliers Royaux sont récemment devenus la cible de plusieurs attaques perpétrées par un assaillant inconnu. C'est humiliant pour les défenseurs du Royaume d'être dans cette position en premier lieu, mais la situation est plus grave qu'une simple perte de prestige.${prompt}
  6861: Il circule une rumeur parmi les chevaliers selon laquelle ces attaques seraient le fait d'Erpalacion, le dernier dragonnier. Cela inquiète les hommes.${prompt}
  6862: Comme vous le savez sûrement, Erpalacion était le général des chevaliers sous le règne du Roi Ranperre, et le seul dragonnier en existence à l'époque.${prompt}
  6863: 'Tous les historiens sont d’accord sur ce point : Sans la force d’Erpalacion, de nombreux grands accomplissements auraient été hors de portée pour le Roi Ranperre.${prompt}'
  6864: Erpalacion a rejoint les rangs des défunts, il n’y a donc aucun moyen qu'il soit responsable de ces attaques. Mais les craintes des chevaliers ont une certaine validité. Il y a une histoire racontée sur Erpalacion...${prompt}
  6865: Immédiatement après que le Roi Ranperre eut apaisé les troubles au sein du Royaume, Erpalacion fut envoyé par les ordres du roi en expédition dans les Terres Extérieures.${prompt}
  6866: Il est largement dit que cette expédition n'avait aucune signification stratégique, et que le Roi Ranperre craignait simplement la puissance d'Erpalacion.${prompt}
  6867: |-
    He was never heard from again.
    King Ranperre apparently nodded in satisfaction when hearing the report from the returning soldiers...${prompt}
  6868: |-
    I do not believe this story.
    Even if there is some truth to the tale, there is unlikely to be a reappearance of the last dragoon.
    ...However, I have no evidence to support my views.${prompt}
  6869: |-
    I wish to assign you the task of gathering information on the attacks against the Royal Knights.
    The true culprit must be brought to justice. What say you?${prompt}
  6870: |-
    I have a task for you.
    I wish you to gather information on the true culprit behind these attacks. Considering your profession, surely you wish to dispel these rumors that sully the honor of your fellow dragoon.${prompt}
  6871: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me.
    Other duties call me.${prompt}

  6877: Yes, sir. My apologies.${prompt}
  6878: |-
    These empty shells will not rise again.
    Clear these away, and not a word to anyone of this.${prompt}
  6879: 'Yes, sir!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  6880: |-
    We must get to the bottom of this matter.
    Have you noticed anything strange these past few days?${prompt}
  6881: |-
    Someone tried to steal the brais of the last dragoon...?
    Well, that certainly qualifies. Start your investigation from there.${prompt}
  6882: You might try asking for information from the people at the Brugaire Consortium.${prompt}
  6883: I concede that this is a problem that only concerns the knights... However, I feel that someone outside our ranks, with some distance from events, has a better chance to grasp the whole picture. Tell me if you have a change of heart.${prompt}
  6884: |-
    The people at the Brugaire Consortium may have information concerning the brais of the last dragoon.
    I doubt they would agree with me, but the merchants there owe me a favor.${prompt}
  6885: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]}!
    This handwriting...
    That's what this is all about!
    ...You must talk with Sir Balasiel on this matter.${prompt}
  6886: |-
    I cannot speak of it...
    Or rather, I do not wish to speak of it...${prompt}
  6887: |-
    You must take this matter to Sir Balasiel.
    I cannot speak of it...
    Or rather, I do not wish to speak of it...${prompt}
  6888: "Ancolain was a powerful warrior, but he lacked self-control.\nI bode my time until his return to the ranks... \nBut never did I imagine things would come to this.${prompt}"
  6889: So you learned from Sir Balasiel that your wyvern can sense Ancolain's location...based on the shadow of the thoughts that still cling to the letter. I only hope that he hasn't dabbled in any of the black arts that are practiced by those savages to the south.${prompt}
  6890: The misunderstanding that long surrounded King Ranperre and the last dragoon has now been cleared--and with it, the chaos that threatened the stability of the knights. You have my thanks.${prompt}

  7050: Ah, vous êtes ${name-player}, n'est-ce pas ? J'ai entendu parler de vous depuis la guérite. Nous avons une mission pour vous, une mission spéciale.${prompt}
  7051: Nos éclaireurs disent que les hommes-bêtes se lèvent à nouveau... Pas seulement ici, mais aussi dans des terres lointaines. Nous voulons que vous alliez à Bastok et Windurst pour voir comment ils s'en sortent.${prompt}
  7052: 'Là-bas, vous pourrez être reconnu par les deux nations, avec ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Pas mal, non ?${prompt}'
  7053: Je vous ordonne officiellement de vous rendre en mission. Visitez les deux pays de Bastok et Windurst, et recevez une reconnaissance en tant qu'aventurier.${prompt}
  7054: Voici une lettre d'introduction aux consulats de San d'Oria. Remettez-la au consul, et ils sauront quoi faire de vous.${prompt}
  7055: 'Le consulat vous donnera d’autres ordres. Une fois que les deux pays vous auront officiellement reconnu, revenez ici. Je vous délivrerai votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7056: Ce sera votre premier voyage à l'étranger, ${name-player}, n'est-ce pas ? Nul ne sait quelles aventures vous attendent. Prenez soin de vous, et revenez sain et sauf.${prompt}
  7057: Vous devez d'abord visiter les consulats san d'oriens à Bastok et Windurst. Les consuls là-bas vous donneront d'autres ordres.${prompt}
  7058: Ah, c'est vous, ${name-player}. Comment vont les choses dans les terres étrangères ? Revenez une fois que vous aurez été officiellement reconnu. J'ai toute confiance en vous.${prompt}
  7059: Vous êtes dans les murs du Château d'Oraguille, résidence de la royauté. Conduisez-vous en conséquence.${prompt}
  7060: Un aventurier de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous avez mon respect pour être venu jusqu'ici.${prompt}
  7061: Un aventurier de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous avez mon respect pour être venu jusqu'ici.${prompt}
  7062: 'Mais sachez ceci : notre Royaume de San d’Oria n’a aucune intention de montrer une façade amicale ni à Bastok ni à Windurst.${prompt}'
  7063: Comment ces foules sans classe peuvent-elles jamais penser à se tenir aux côtés des Elvaans est, franchement, au-delà de moi.${prompt}
  7064: Et pourtant vous venez--des crevettes bégayantes impertinentes, des têtes de minerai maladroites, des boules de poils ronronnantes ! C'est tout simplement inacceptable.${prompt}
  7065: Mais, assez de cela...${prompt}
  7066: 'Voici votre mission : infiltrer le poste avancé de Ghelsba, au nord-ouest de San d’Oria.${prompt}'
  7067: Au milieu des camps de Ghelsba se trouve un endroit appelé le campement des hautes terres. Nous voulons que vous battiez le chef du camp, un certain "Warchief Vatgit".${prompt}
  7068: Vous trouverez le campement un peu plus loin dans Ghelsba. Entrez, traversez la rivière, et vous verrez les camps sur une crête à l'est.${prompt}
  7069: Une fois terminé, si vous n'êtes pas devenu une pâtée pour Orcs, retournez à votre propre consulat. Nous n'apprécions pas les étrangers qui traînent autour du château, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.${prompt}
  7070: Les Orcs ne sont pas un problème si grave que le Royaume ait à s'inquiéter d'envoyer des chevaliers. Laissez les aventuriers les nettoyer pour quelques pièces de monnaie--c'est notre politique.${prompt}
  7071: Ne me faites pas répéter. Allez-y.${prompt}
  7072: Félicitations, mais n'attendez rien de nous. Notre politique envers les Windurstiens et les Bastokiens peut être résumée comme une "coopération détachée", voyez-vous.${prompt}
  7073: Un aventurier de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ? Le consul Helaku a envoyé un message à votre sujet. Vous avez l'air capable, c'est certain.${prompt}
  7074: Un aventurier de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ? Le consul Kasaroro a envoyé un message à votre sujet. Vous avez l'air capable, c'est certain.${prompt}
  7075: Eh bien, vous n'atteindrez peut-être jamais la gloire des Chevaliers Royaux, mais faites du bon travail, et vous serez récompensé en conséquence.${prompt}
  7076: Voici notre dilemme. Les Orcs ont établi une base d'opérations de première ligne dans un endroit appelé le poste avancé de Ghelsba, au nord-ouest de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7077: Vous connaissez les Quadavs, non ? Eh bien, les Orcs sont exactement comme eux. Une race vicieuse et barbare, et assez stupide en plus.${prompt}
  7078: Vous connaissez les Yagudos, non ? Eh bien, les Orcs sont exactement comme eux. Une race vicieuse et barbare, et assez stupide en plus.${prompt}
  7079: Le problème, c'est que ces Orcs ont montré des signes d'intelligence récemment. Ils ont commencé à utiliser des armes à distance... même des machines de guerre !${prompt}
  7080: Nos investigations indiquent que quelqu'un est derrière les Orcs, leur fournissant des armes.${prompt}
  7081: Nous voulons que vous trouviez une caverne au fond du poste avancé de Ghelsba--un endroit appelé la Grotte de Yughott.${prompt}
  7082: Nous avons envoyé beaucoup d'aventuriers à la Grotte de Yughott, mais peu sont revenus, et nous désespérons d'obtenir des informations.${prompt}
  7083: Il peut y avoir un certain... danger, mais si vous nous fournissez des informations utiles, la reconnaissance officielle du Royaume de San d'Oria sera vôtre.${prompt}
  7084: Je suis un peu occupé ici. Rendez-vous au consulat san d'orien de votre pays lorsque vous aurez terminé cette mission.${prompt}
  7085: Eh bien, ${name-player}, c'est bon de vous revoir. Voyons le rapport que vous avez ramené, alors !${prompt}
  7086: Le Seigneur des Ombres... de retour !? C'est impossible ! Il a été tué par nos forces pendant la Grande Guerre il y a vingt ans...${prompt}
  7087: Quoi !? Les bêtes des ténèbres se sont échappées dans cette terre ? C'est une nouvelle des plus graves !${prompt}
  7088: Si ce rapport est vrai, nous devons agir.${prompt}
  7089: Hmm... mais, pour être honnête, j'ai du mal à y croire.${prompt}
  7090: 'Très bien. Je vais prendre ce rapport. Il vous sera remis ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, comme promis.${prompt}'
  7091: Votre dernière réussite vous fait passer au rang de mission 3. Félicitations.${prompt}
  7092: Vous devez être fatigué. Reposez-vous dans ce château. Il y a ici de quoi apaiser l'esprit et réchauffer le cœur.${prompt}
  7093: Je vous attendais, ${name-player}. Comme vous l'avez probablement déjà entendu depuis la guérite, vous devez vous rendre à l'Ambassade de San d'Oria à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7094: Nos relations avec Jeuno sont essentielles pour maintenir l'équilibre des pouvoirs entre notre Royaume de San d'Oria, Windurst, et Bastok.${prompt}
  7095: Vous recevrez votre lettre d'introduction à Jeuno de Sa Majesté le Roi Destin en personne. C'est un grand honneur !${prompt}
  7096: Passez par la porte pour accéder à la salle d'audience. Le roi vous attend. N'oubliez pas de respecter le protocole !${prompt}
  7097: Vous avez obtenu une audience avec le roi.${prompt}
  7098: Votre audience avec le roi est terminée.${prompt}
  7099: Qu'y a-t-il ? Ne faites pas attendre le roi !${prompt}
  7100: Bienvenue, ${name-player}. Je suis Destin, Roi de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7101: Soyez à l'aise. J'ai entendu parler de vous par Claidie. Vous avez beaucoup fait pour le Royaume, semble-t-il !${prompt}
  7102: Comme vous l'a sûrement dit Lord Halver, nous avons décidé de vous nommer pour servir à l'Ambassade de San d'Oria à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7103: Récemment, nous avons perdu l'un de nos membres là-bas. Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, car vous servirez sous ma nomination directe.${prompt}
  7104: Prenez cette lettre d'introduction et partez pour Jeuno.${prompt}
  7105: L'ambassade a été informée et vous attend. Montrez la lettre à l'un des membres du personnel là-bas.${prompt}
  7106: Partez dès que possible.${prompt}
  7107: 'Bon voyage, ${name-player}.${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7108: Allez à Jeuno et apportez cette lettre d'introduction avec vous. L'ambassadeur Jima est impatient de vous voir !${prompt}
  7109: Bonjour, ${name-player}. Vous vous êtes précipité de Jeuno après avoir entendu la nouvelle, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, nous nous sommes déjà occupés de ces bandits.${prompt}
  7110: Halver exagère encore, en parlant d'une tentative d'assassinat ratée. Que peut-il vouloir dire par le roi tombant inconscient ? Il ne va sûrement pas appeler des aventuriers au château pour de telles bêtises !${prompt}
  7111: De tels brigands ne peuvent pas tenir tête à la puissance des Chevaliers du Temple ! Ses chuchotements déshonorent notre nation. N'êtes-vous pas d'accord ?${prompt}
  7112: Curilla ? Êtes-vous là ?${prompt}
  7113: Oui, Votre Majesté !${prompt}
  7114: Ah, très bien. Votre leadership était exemplaire, comme toujours. Grâce à vous, je peux me concentrer sur mes devoirs.${prompt}
  7115: Vous êtes trop aimable, Votre Majesté.${prompt}
  7116: Cependant, Curilla, il semble qu'il y ait quelque chose que vous avez négligé.${prompt}
  7117: Votre Majesté ?${prompt}
  7118: Pendant l'agitation, quelqu'un s'est enfui avec le talisman !${prompt}
  7119: Le talisman, Votre Majesté ? Pas celui qui garde le Seigneur des Ombres emprisonné !${prompt}
  7120: Celui-là même. Nous avons été visités par un infiltré pendant que nos yeux étaient fixés sur les brigands.${prompt}
  7121: Donc, les intrus n'étaient qu'un leurre...${prompt}
  7122: Je les soupçonnais.${prompt}
  7123: Et qui pourrait connaître l'existence du talisman, même parmi les San d'Oriens ? Votre Majesté, je crains que quelqu'un désireux de ramener le Seigneur des Ombres de son exil ne soit responsable de cela !${prompt}
  7124: Mais avant de traquer cet infiltré, nous devons d'abord contrecarrer leur sinistre complot. Halver, décidons d'un plan d'action.${prompt}
  7125: Curilla, ne vous découragez pas ; ce n'est en aucun cas de votre faute. Levez l'alerte et reprenez vos fonctions habituelles.${prompt}
  7126: Eh bien, ${name-player}, nous avons encore besoin de votre aide. Halver vous transmettra bientôt mes ordres... Souvenez-vous, vous avez notre gratitude !${prompt}
  7127: Nous allons entamer immédiatement des discussions sur une politique d'action. ${name-player}, vous devez travailler à améliorer vos compétences et votre équipement.${prompt}
  7128: Ne parlez pas de la tentative d'assassinat contre le roi, ni de cette affaire avec le Seigneur des Ombres, de peur que la panique ne s'empare du Royaume !${prompt}
  7129: Nous avons enfin pris une décision, ${name-player}. Nous enverrons une expédition dans les maudites Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  7130: Elle se rendra dans les anciennes ruines de Fei'Yin, au nord-est du glacier de Beaucedine. Bien sûr, vous y allez aussi.${prompt}
  7131: Les ruines sont celles d'une ville construite par une ancienne civilisation que nous croyons plus avancée que la nôtre.${prompt}
  7132: La race qui y vivait s'appelait les Zilart. Nous avons trouvé des ruines similaires sur le Cap Teriggan, au sud.${prompt}
  7133: Étonnamment, elles restent intactes, bien qu'elles aient été construites il y a longtemps. C'est comme si une force invisible défiait le temps pour les protéger.${prompt}
  7134: Il y a trente ans, une expédition internationale a été envoyée dans les Terres du Nord. Ils devaient découvrir le secret de la puissance des Zilart.${prompt}
  7135: Ils sont revenus les mains vides. Nous avons besoin que vous vous rendiez au glacier de Beaucedine et que vous exploriez vous-même les ruines de Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7136: Les ruines sont envahies par des monstres, vous savez. Nous les avons capturées du Seigneur des Ombres il y a vingt ans au prix de nombreuses vies.${prompt}
  7137: Nous avons placé un sceau sur le colisée en ruines pour renforcer la barrière des Terres du Nord de l'intérieur.${prompt}
  7138: Vous devez le trouver et utiliser ce nouveau sceau pour renforcer sa magie si nécessaire.${prompt}
  7139: Oui, je suis préoccupé par le retour du Seigneur des Ombres. Mais si la frontière tombe et que les bêtes des ténèbres entrent dans notre royaume, tout ce monde tombera en ruine.${prompt}
  7140: Bien sûr, vous y allez aussi.${prompt}
  7141: Bienvenue, ${name-player}. Le temps presse, comme vous le savez, alors je vais faire fi des formalités. Qu'avez-vous trouvé à Fei'Yin ?${prompt}
  7142: Donc, le sceau de Fei'Yin était déjà brisé... Que ferons-nous, si les bêtes des ténèbres sont amenées à combattre comme il y a vingt ans ?${prompt}
  7143: La réponse est simple, Halver. Nous devons les attaquer !${prompt}
  7144: Mais, Votre Altesse, nous manquons de connaissances sur notre ennemi. Bien que tentante, une attaque serait bien trop dangereuse.${prompt}
  7145: Une attaque serait des plus efficaces à ce stade précoce ! Nous n'avons pas à nous inquiéter de nos forces, non plus. De nombreux aventuriers téméraires sont prêts à se battre.${prompt}
  7146: Ne soyez pas si hâtif, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  7147: Curilla ! Quelle agréable surprise !${prompt}
  7148: Veuillez considérer l'alliance ! Nous ne devons pas déplacer des troupes au-delà de nos frontières sans d'abord consulter nos alliés.${prompt}
  7149: L'ennemi est sur nous ! Nous n'avons pas le temps de discuter avec des étrangers. Nous devons agir maintenant !${prompt}
  7150: Pardonnez-moi, mais comment expliquerons-nous cela, alors qu'il était de notre responsabilité, en tant que gardiens des Terres du Nord, d'arrêter nos ennemis avant qu'ils ne frappent ?${prompt}
  7151: Il n'est pas de notre devoir d'expliquer aux étrangers les politiques de notre royaume. Nous devrions déplacer nos forces maintenant, afin qu'aucune explication ne soit nécessaire !${prompt}
  7152: S'il vous plaît, je vous en prie ! Demandez à Jeuno de rassembler les trois grandes nations et d'établir un front unifié !${prompt}
  7153: Silence, Curilla, silence ! Depuis quand es-tu devenue la colombe larmoyante ?${prompt}
  7154: S'il vous plaît, écoutez la raison, Prince Trion ! Nous n'avons que peu d'informations sur le retour du Seigneur des Ombres, et celles que nous avons ont été recueillies par des aventuriers - elles sont au mieux peu fiables !${prompt}
  7155: Mais si le Seigneur des Ombres est revenu, alors nous avons encore plus besoin de l'aide des autres pays !${prompt}
  7156: J'en ai assez de tes bavardages, Curilla ! Il est clair que je ne peux compter que sur moi-même pour une direction décisive !${prompt}
  7157: Où est donc parti mon cher frère Pieuje, à un moment aussi critique ?${prompt}
  7158: Bavardages ?${prompt}
  7159: Avec la reconnaissance de Fei'Yin terminée, notre royaume doit agir rapidement. Malheureusement, dans les circonstances actuelles, je ne peux pas donner d'ordre pour votre prochaine mission.${prompt}
  7160: Je crois qu'il nous faudra du temps pour prendre une décision. Votre heure viendra en temps voulu, mon ami. D'ici là, portez-vous bien.${prompt}
  7161: Des manœuvres politiques, dites-vous ? Penser que notre nation pourrait devenir ce marécage de manipulation et d'intrigue...${prompt}
  7162: Nous n'avons pas le temps pour ces pitreries ! S'ils complotent vraiment pour ressusciter le Seigneur des Ombres, nous n'avons pas une minute à perdre !${prompt}
  7163: Les choses ne peuvent pas continuer ainsi. Il doit y avoir un moyen de le convaincre...${prompt}
  7164: Je comprends la ferveur de son seigneur, mais le risque est trop grand pour nous. Je crois que cela nécessite la plus grande prudence.${prompt}
  7165: Ah, ${name-player}, n'est-ce pas ? Le prince Trion vous cherchait.${prompt}
  7166: Combien de temps ces imbéciles veulent-ils rester ici à discuter de notre mort ? Nous n'avons plus le temps de parler, pas maintenant.${prompt}
  7167: Nous devons agir pour empêcher le retour du Seigneur des Ombres, ou la guerre s'abattra de nouveau sur Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7168: ${name-player}, c'est un ordre ! Dépêchez-vous autant que possible d'aller au Château Zvahl, au nord, et mettez fin à ce plan diabolique des hommes-bêtes !${prompt}
  7169: J'assumerai toute la responsabilité de cette mission. Maintenant, allez, brave guerrier ! Pour l'avenir de Vana'diel !${prompt}
  7170: Insensé ! Il a été détruit pendant la Grande Guerre, il y a vingt ans ! Ils ont dû le confondre avec un autre démon - c'est ce qui s'est passé, j'en suis sûr !${prompt}
  7171: Qui est l'imbécile ici ? Si c'est vraiment lui, alors quoi ? Nous serions alors confrontés à bien pire que la racaille des hommes-bêtes !${prompt}
  7172: Réfléchis avant de parler, frère ! Si c'est lui, alors pourquoi ne s'est-il pas montré ces vingt dernières années ?${prompt}
  7173: Je dis que nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre de prendre ce risque ! C'est plus qu'une affaire interne - nous devons envoyer une équipe d'enquête immédiatement !${prompt}
  7174: Bienvenue, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7175: Je suis Mistaravant. J'ai servi comme majordome en chef de ce château pendant de nombreuses années.${prompt}
  7176: C'est la chambre du roi Destin. Pas un endroit pour quelqu'un comme vous.${prompt}
  7177: Ne flânez pas dans le château.${prompt}
  7178: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Je ne tolérerai pas les fauteurs de troubles dans le château ou ses jardins ! Occupez-vous de vos affaires, ou soyez expulsé, le choix vous appartient.${prompt}

  7197: Hmph. Ne prenez pas la grosse tête juste parce que la princesse a jugé bon de vous accorder quelques mots. Cela ne signifie rien !${prompt}
  7198: Je suis occupé. Si cela ne vous dérange pas, j'apprécierais un peu de paix et de tranquillité !${prompt}
  7199: Ce jardin est le jardin mémorial de notre défunte Reine Leaute. Elle a toujours aimé les fleurs, et elle voulait être enterrée ici, voyez-vous.${prompt}
  7200: Vous êtes un aventurier venant de l'étranger, n'est-ce pas ? Si vous avez une mission du monarlais, vous feriez bien de vous y atteler rapidement.${prompt}
  7201: Ce monarlais n'aime pas traiter avec vous, les étrangers. En y réfléchissant bien, moi non plus !${prompt}
  7202: Je suis Rahal S. Lebrart, général des Chevaliers Royaux de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7203: Les Chevaliers Royaux sont l'épée de San d'Oria. Nous frappons rapidement et nous effaçons les nids de monstres de la face de Vana'diel !${prompt}
  7204: Nous sommes une bande de guerriers, et certains d'entre nous sont connus pour être... trop zélés. Mais il n'y a pas un cœur sombre parmi nous. Vous avez ma parole !${prompt}
  7205: Je viens juste de revenir de Bastok. Là-bas, il y a ces Quadavs qui vivent dans les mines !${prompt}
  7206: Les Bastokiens creusent pour des pierres et laissent les Quadavs tranquilles. Mais je dis que nous devrions tuer jusqu'au dernier de ces monstres à carapace !${prompt}
  7207: Le Chevalier Royal Aramaviont rapportant ! Je suis revenu de Windurst. Peut-être que c'est juste moi, mais je suis sûr que les petits cachent quelque chose !${prompt}
  7208: Pourquoi sinon laisseraient-ils les Yagudos courir partout dans la campagne ? Si j'étais eux, j'enfermerais ces horribles volatiles dans des cages !${prompt}
  7209: Je suis Curilla V Mecru, et voici les quartiers des Chevaliers du Temple. Nous sommes le bouclier de San d'Oria, protégeant les murs de la ville contre les monstres.${prompt}
  7210: Les gardes du château et de la ville appartiennent également aux Chevaliers du Temple. N'oubliez pas, nous sommes ici pour vous servir et vous protéger.${prompt}
  7211: Bien sûr, nous avons peu de patience avec les gens douteux. Prenez garde à ne pas être pris pour tel.${prompt}

  7445: Prince Trion, puis-je prendre le temps de m'occuper de cela?${prompt}
  7446: Je suis désolé, Curilla, mais vous êtes convoquée pour le service. Le pape a fait part de ses plaintes concernant les régions entourant San d'Oria qui sont trop faiblement patrouillées. Nous devons réfléchir à un plan.${prompt}

  7467: Vous l'avez porté loin, alors je vais vous raconter l'histoire. Mais gardez-la secrète, je vous en prie!${prompt}
  7468: Ahem! Il y a des siècles, un barde est venu à San d'Oria. Sa voix était si émouvante que les oiseaux chanteurs s'arrêtaient pour l'écouter.${prompt}
  7469: Le roi était tellement touché qu'il cherchait à le garder ici à San d'Oria, ne serait-ce qu'un jour de plus.${prompt}
  7470: Le talentueux barde a prolongé son séjour. Mais ce faisant, il a volé le cœur de la reine!${prompt}
  7471: Voyez-vous, son mariage avec le roi n'était pas par amour, et elle était bien plus jeune que lui.${prompt}
  7472: Mais toujours, une reine doit rester fidèle à son mari, ne pensez-vous pas?${prompt}
  7473: Souvent, les deux amants se cachaient pour se protéger des regards indiscrets.${prompt}
  7474: Ils ont forgé une paire d'anneaux et se sont promis l'un à l'autre de ne faire qu'un dans l'autre monde.${prompt}
  7475: Mais ensuite, soudainement...${prompt}
  7476: Le roi apprit son infidélité!${prompt}
  7477: Sa rage face à la liaison entre sa propre reine et son ménestrel préféré ne connaissait pas de limites. Le barde fut exécuté par empoisonnement!${prompt}
  7478: Mais jamais la reine n'oublia son amant.${prompt}
  7479: Pour le pleurer convenablement, elle demanda secrètement à mes aînés de fabriquer des ornements funéraires.${prompt}
  7480: Elle a orné son corps avec eux, a transporté les restes à Eldieme, et finalement les a enterrés là. Malheureusement, des pilleurs de tombes sont venus plus tard et ont ravagé son cercueil, dispersant les ornements dans toutes les directions!${prompt}
  7481: Peu de temps après, le roi est décédé.${prompt}
  7482: La reine a alors quitté le palais pour un couvent, où elle a vécu paisiblement jusqu'à la fin de ses jours.${prompt}
  7483: Son anneau a été donné à mon ancêtre, et depuis lors, il a été transmis jusqu'à moi. ${prompt}
  7484: Sans aucun doute, l'anneau que vous tenez appartenait à son amant, le barde!${prompt}
  7485: Je crois que les deux anneaux devraient être réunis. S'il vous plaît, pourriez-vous les placer ensemble sur l'autel dans la caverne monastique?${prompt}
  7486: Sa Majesté est enterrée là, et je suis sûr que son esprit en serait grandement satisfait.${prompt}

  7489: Maintenant, placez les deux anneaux sur l'autel de la caverne monastique. Je crois en vous, ami !${prompt}
  7490: Je reste un serviteur de la royauté, voyez-vous, donc peut-être que je me comporte de manière déloyale. Mais je voudrais que son dernier souhait se réalise !${prompt}
  7491: Eh bien, je crois qu'il serait préférable qu'ils soient placés ensemble, mais les anneaux ne sont pas à moi ; je ne vous donnerai pas d'ordre !${prompt}
  7492: Prenez les deux anneaux et placez-les sur l'autel de la caverne monastique -- les ruines du couvent de Sa Majesté. Alors son souhait se réalisera enfin.${prompt}
  7493: Permettez-moi de vous remercier au nom de Sa Majesté. Et, je vous remercie personnellement pour avoir sacrifié quelque chose qui vous appartient !${prompt}
  7494: Un des ornements funéraires m'a été confié, mais je préfère que vous l'ayez. Cela peut paraître insignifiant en comparaison de l'anneau, mais c'est tout ce que ce jardinier a à donner.${prompt}
  7495: Hein ?${prompt}
  7496: Oh... Oh, oui.${prompt}
  7497: Eh bien, c'est bon alors. Je suis sûr que la reine est contente.${prompt}
  7498: DUMMY${prompt}
  7499: Qu'y a-t-il ?${prompt}
  7500: Quoi ? Des bottes de la bouche d'un poisson ?${prompt}
  7501: 'Oui, celles-ci sont distribuées à nos chevaliers. Les semelles sont gravées au nom de leur propriétaire. Oui, voici l’inscription : “Chusarlaud.”${prompt}'
  7502: Hmm... Amenez-moi Vilbert.${prompt}
  7503: Oui, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  7504: Que désirez-vous, mon seigneur ?${prompt}
  7505: Je me souviens que vous connaissiez Chusarlaud avant sa disparition. Je vous ai déjà interrogé, mais vous rappelez-vous de quelque chose de nouveau ?${prompt}
  7506: Non, mon seigneur... Est-ce que quelque chose a été révélé depuis notre dernière conversation ?${prompt}
  7507: J'en ai bien peur, Vilbert. Merci, c'est tout.${prompt}
  7508: Oui, mon seigneur !${prompt}
  7509: Gardez cela secret, mais il y a un an, je croyais que les Orcs étaient au courant des rouages de cette cour.${prompt}
  7510: Je soupçonnais Chusarlaud d'être leur espion, encore plus après sa disparition. Je n'ai jamais pensé qu'il était mort.${prompt}
  7511: Je cherche un candidat approprié pour enquêter sur cette affaire, de préférence un chevalier. Je vous aurais demandé si seulement... Oh, peu importe.${prompt}
  7512: Accepteriez-vous de vous pencher sur sa disparition ? Cette affaire requiert l'objectivité d'un étranger.${prompt}
  7513: |-
    Acceptez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Avec plaisir.
    Je refuse humblement.${prompt}
  7514: Rappelez-vous, ne dites pas un mot de ceci aux chevaliers ! Chusarlaud habitait autrefois à San d'Oria Sud, alors vous devriez commencer votre recherche là-bas.${prompt}
  7515: Très bien, informez-moi dès que vous en saurez plus.${prompt}
  7516: 'Est-ce ainsi ? Eh bien, je sais que vous avez d’autres responsabilités également. Mais écoutez ceci : Il n’y a personne d’autre à qui je pourrais confier cette tâche. Revenez ici dès que vous êtes en mesure de nous servir.${prompt}'
  7517: 'Je vous remercie d’avoir livré ceci. Voici votre récompense, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7518: Rappelez-vous, Chusarlaud habitait autrefois à San d'Oria Sud, alors commencez votre recherche là-bas. Et ne dites pas un mot aux chevaliers !${prompt}
  7519: Quoi ? Vous avez résolu le mystère ! Vite, dites-moi tout.${prompt}
  7520: Je vois. Plus tôt, Exoroche a demandé une audience. Ses réalisations méritent en effet des éloges !${prompt}
  7521: Rassemblez tous les chevaliers de sa division !${prompt}
  7522: 'Exoroche, en reconnaissance de votre bravoure au service des Chevaliers Royaux, je vous décerne ce ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7523: Je suis submergé de gratitude, mon prince, mais je décline humblement, car je n'ai plus besoin ni d'épée ni d'armure.${prompt}
  7524: 'Je ne cherche qu’une chose : être reconnu comme un véritable chevalier, quels que soient les attributs que je porte. À cette fin, je me consacrerai pleinement.${prompt}'
  7525: Père !${prompt}
  7526: Des paroles louables ! Ô parangon de la vertu de San d'Oria, puissiez-vous répondre à nos grandes attentes !${prompt}
  7527: Vous donnez des éloges trop facilement, mon seigneur. Je devrais plutôt demander pardon pour mes manquements passés. Pourtant, j'ai une requête, si je peux me permettre, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  7528: Nommez-la.${prompt}
  7529: Pourriez-vous plutôt la donner à ${name-player} ? C'est grâce à ${choice-player-gender}[son/sa] aide que cette affaire a été réglée.${prompt}
  7530: 'Ainsi soit-il. Venez recevoir le ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, en reconnaissance de votre glorieux service à notre ordre. Vous avez aussi mes remerciements personnels.${prompt}'
  7531: Prince Trion, mon fils et moi demandons maintenant votre congé.${prompt}
  7532: Ailbeche, jeune garçon, ton père est un grand chevalier. Puisses-tu devenir aussi fort que lui.${prompt}
  7533: M-merci, Prince Trion !${prompt}
  7534: Et merci, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  7535: Quoi ? Les blessures de mon frère s'aggravent ?${prompt}
  7536: Il ne laisse personne les voir, mon seigneur, mais il n'y a aucun doute. C'est notre chance !${prompt}
  7537: Maintenant que les blessures du Prince Trion le gênent, vous êtes libre de réaliser un grand exploit, vous rapprochant encore plus de... Hmm ?${prompt}
  7538: Qui est là !?${prompt}
  7539: Oh, c'est notre allié, l'aventurier. Parfait timing, je dois dire.${prompt}
  7540: 'Prince Pieuje, ${name-player} a tendu une embuscade au sombre traqueur à la lisière ouest des dunes de Valkurm, et nous a apporté ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7541: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? Du sombre traqueur ? Alors, la légende est vraie !${prompt}'
  7542: Votre connaissance est grande, en effet, Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
  7543: Quels complots tissez-vous, Narcheral ?${prompt}
  7544: Il semble que le sombre traqueur repéré à Valkurm était un messager de son vivant.${prompt}
  7545: Le message qu'il portait parle des Tavnaziens tués il y a vingt ans. Ils se relèveraient de la tombe pour restaurer le marquisat !${prompt}
  7546: Impossible ! Comment les morts pourraient-ils se rassembler ?${prompt}
  7547: C'est vrai, Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
  7548: Qui êtes-vous !?${prompt}
  7549: Narcheral m'a envoyé chercher à travers Eldieme. J'ai découvert que les sombres traqueurs se rassemblaient.${prompt}
  7550: Et j'ai entendu dire qu'une grande ombre noire avait rampé au-delà de Ranguemont.${prompt}
  7551: Le messager qui en a été témoin a juré qu'il s'agissait du seigneur de Tavnazia, le Marquis Altedour.${prompt}
  7552: Non ! Pas le Seigneur Altedour !${prompt}
  7553: C'était le Marquis, et en même temps, ce n'était pas lui ! C'était une présence qui trompe le cœur et apporte la peur à notre saint royaume.${prompt}
  7554: Silence, Narcheral ! Vous déshonorez le marquis !${prompt}
  7555: Pardonnez-moi, mon seigneur. Mais, je crains que nous ne puissions plus éviter la menace. Je vous implore de rassembler des troupes !${prompt}
  7556: Jeronne, continuez l'enquête. Si des nouvelles viennent des Terres du Nord, le Prince Trion sera sûrement informé.${prompt}
  7557: Je comprends.${prompt}
  7558: Et j'ai quelque chose que je souhaite discuter avec vous. Bientôt, nous aurons besoin des services d'un mage blanc expérimenté. Cherchez un candidat.${prompt}
  7559: Afin que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] puisse combattre les impurs, nous accréditerons le détenteur des pouvoirs sacrés en lui donnant un objet béni par Altana.${prompt}
  7560: ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] aura beaucoup à gagner. Quelque chose d'inaccessible ailleurs...${prompt}
  7561: 'Trouvez ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. On dit que les Yagudos de Zvahl et Oztroja l’utilisent pour bannir les déchus.${prompt}'
  7562: 'J’ai aussi besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, afin de refaire ce que je prévois de vous donner.${prompt}'
  7563: Je vous donnerai l’objet béni une fois que vous aurez apporté ces deux articles.${prompt}
  7564: Quelle folie est-ce ? Je n’ai rien fait de mal !${prompt}
  7565: Pensez à une façon de vaincre les hommes-bêtes, si vous avez le temps de vous inquiéter pour moi !${prompt}
  7566: Frère !${prompt}
  7567: Laissez-moi deviner. Narcheral vous a envoyé pour me convaincre, non ?${prompt}
  7568: Savez-vous pourquoi Narcheral s'inquiète autant ?${prompt}
  7569: Il y a vingt ans, les armées de l'alliance ont offert le Marquisat de Tavnazia comme appât. L'ennemi a reçu de fausses informations sur le lieu où les dirigeants de Tavnazia se réuniraient.${prompt}
  7570: Alors que des hordes d'hommes-bêtes lançaient leur assaut, une compagnie audacieuse de volontaires a frappé les portes non gardées de l'ennemi.${prompt}
  7571: Là, ils ont trouvé et tué le Seigneur des Ombres. Mais sa horde a réduit Tavnazia en cendres et en fumée.${prompt}
  7572: Selon toute probabilité, leur seigneur, le Marquis Altedour, n'a jamais soupçonné de trahison de la part de ses alliés fidèles.${prompt}
  7573: La horde les avait attaqués de nuit. Vaillamment, il a combattu pour défendre son donjon. À la fin, il est tombé, et il a fui la ville. Près de la nécropole, cependant, ils l'ont attrapé !${prompt}
  7574: Bien qu'il ait tué sept cents ennemis, c'est là qu'il a rencontré sa fin.${prompt}
  7575: L'alliance a envoyé des troupes pour aider à la défense de Tavnazia, mais personne ne peut nier que cela a apporté la ruine.${prompt}
  7576: Le Marquis Altedour est mon... Je... Que dois-je faire ?${prompt}
  7577: Prince Pieuje, êtes-vous là ?${prompt}
  7578: Oh, Narcheral... Entrez !${prompt}
  7579: Prince Pieuje ! Je viens de voir le Prince Trion, et il semblait bien aller !${prompt}
  7580: Oui... Je suis sûr qu'il semble bien à vos yeux.${prompt}
  7581: Sûrement le Prince Trion apprendra tout cela, mon seigneur ! Nous perdrons cette chance de renforcer l'influence de notre foi !${prompt}
  7582: Vous voulez dire la purification des damnés, et leur offrir l'expiation par ma main ?${prompt}
  7583: Non, mon seigneur ! Pour nous débarrasser de la menace des morts ! Mon seigneur, l'héritier du trône de San d'Oria ne doit pas plaisanter avec l'expiation !${prompt}
  7584: Je suis désolé. J'ai un plan. Je ne permettrai pas à mon frère de déployer des troupes.${prompt}
  7585: Argh ! Si cela continue, tout sera découvert ! Le chaos consommera San d'Oria--non, tout Vana'diel !${prompt}
  7586: Narcheral, j'ai des nouvelles.${prompt}
  7587: Nous avons reçu des nouvelles qu'un sombre traqueur marche sous les traits du Marquis Altedour vers Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7588: En ce lieu se regroupent également les âmes des nations au-delà de Tavnazia. Peut-être cherche-t-il une armée...${prompt}
  7589: Une armée de morts !? C'est difficile à croire, mais nous serions fous de ne pas y croire.${prompt}
  7590: De grandes forces de morts reposent encore à Eldieme. Nous avons également découvert un objet qu'ils portent tous lorsqu'ils apparaissent.${prompt}
  7591: 'Nous n’avons pas réussi à en obtenir un, mais ils disent que cela s’appelle un ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7592: Hmm... Peut-être est-ce un signal de quelque sorte. Utilisons-le dans notre stratégie une fois que nous l'aurons.${prompt}
  7593: Eh bien...${prompt}
  7594: Oui, nous ne pouvons pas attendre les ordres des forces expéditionnaires. Nous enverrons un cadre d'aventuriers dignes de confiance.${prompt}
  7595: 'Rendez-vous à Fei’Yin après avoir acquis le ${item-singular: 7[2]} à Eldieme.${prompt}'
  7596: De plus grandes récompenses attendent ceux qui se distinguent. Que la fortune vous soit favorable !${prompt}
  7597: Cet endroit n'est pas ouvert aux roturiers, mais puisque vous êtes ici, jetez un œil. La Reine Leaute serait ravie.${prompt}
  7598: ${name-player} ! Nombreux sont ceux qui parlent de vos triomphes au nom de San d'Oria !${prompt}
  7599: Et j'ai beaucoup entendu parler de vos voyages à l'étranger, et comment vous avez combattu les bêtes des ténèbres dans le repaire de l'ennemi.${prompt}
  7600: Ainsi, le retour du Seigneur des Ombres est proche. Peut-être jamais la main du mal ne sera bannie de ce monde.${prompt}
  7601: Mais toujours les justes se lèveront pour y faire face. Ai-je raison, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  7602: 'Les Chevaliers Royaux n’ont qu’un seul objectif : exterminer les Orcs qui ravagent nos terres !${prompt}'
  7603: Nous avons déjà envoyé des éclaireurs à la forteresse orque de Davoi.${prompt}
  7604: Ils doivent faire un rapport sur le nombre d'Orcs, cartographier le territoire et trouver leurs lignes de ravitaillement. Une fois que nous aurons cette connaissance, nous frapperons.${prompt}
  7605: Mais, le rapport des éclaireurs n'est pas encore arrivé ! Que cela peut-il signifier ?${prompt}
  7606: Quoi ? Les Chevaliers du Temple ont également envoyé des éclaireurs à Davoi ? Sur ordre de qui ?${prompt}
  7607: Pieuje. Je le savais ! Quelle folie l'a poussé à faire cela ?${prompt}
  7608: Mais, nous ne devons pas être découragés. ${name-player}, je veux que vous vous rendiez à Davoi immédiatement.${prompt}
  7609: 'Cherchez le Chevalier Royal Quemaricond et prenez son ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Maintenant, hâtez-vous !${prompt}'
  7610: 'Vous êtes de retour ! Vite, montrez-moi le ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7611: Quel rapport ! Nous devons envoyer des troupes immédiatement !${prompt}
  7612: Non, mais attendez... Cette affaire nécessite plus que des Chevaliers Royaux... Nom d'un chien ! Nous avons aussi besoin des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  7613: Perfaumand ! Où sont Pieuje et Curilla ?${prompt}
  7614: Votre Altesse, Dame Curilla est dans les quartiers des Chevaliers du Temple. Quant au Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  7615: ${name-player}, votre mission est terminée. Merci !${prompt}
  7616: Alors, tu dis qu'en fait rien n'a été pris ?
  7617: C'est exact, Seigneur Halver. Je peux comprendre le pillage de nos trésors, mais les chambres de Leaute I d'Oraguille ? Que pouvaient-ils rechercher ?${prompt}
  7618: Les chambres sont restées telles qu'elles étaient lorsque la reine est décédée. Aurait-elle laissé quelque chose d'important ?${prompt}
  7619: Tous ses bijoux sont restés intacts. Il est possible que les voleurs aient confondu les chambres de la reine avec une autre pièce.${prompt}
  7620: 'Hmm. Cependant, j’ai appris que ${item-article: 1[2]} circulait à l’extérieur du château.${prompt}'
  7621: Si les voleurs possèdent ces plans, alors peut-être qu'ils ont d'autres motivations que simplement voler des trésors.${prompt}
  7622: 'Cela se peut. Mais même avec ${item-article: 1[2]}, il faudrait un voleur très habile pour échapper à tous les gardes du château.${prompt}'
  7623: Et selon le jardinier, nos visiteurs étaient un groupe de deux Elvaan...${prompt}
  7624: J'ai appris que des voleurs ont saccagé les chambres de la reine. Informez-moi immédiatement de ce qui a été volé !${prompt}
  7625: "Veuillez être rassuré, Votre Sainteté. \nLes Chevaliers du Temple ont déterminé que les voleurs n'ont rien volé dans le château.${prompt}"
  7626: "Absurde ! Si c'est le cas, pourquoi les voleurs sont-ils entrés en premier lieu ? \nPeut-être que la reine avait quelque chose de caché...${prompt}"
  7627: Pardonnez-moi, Votre Sainteté, mais que voulez-vous dire par "quelque chose" ?${prompt}
  7628: Si je le savais, je ne vous le demanderais pas ! Mais les voleurs ne viendraient pas sans raison !${prompt}
  7629: Bien sûr, Votre Sainteté. J'ordonnerai aux Chevaliers du Temple de poursuivre leur enquête et de vous informer s'ils trouvent quelque chose.${prompt}
  7630: J'attendrai votre rapport. Hmph ! Même la Déesse Altana ne pardonnera pas un tel crime !${prompt}
  7631: Hmm ? Il semble que nous ayons un visiteur.${prompt}
  7632: Tu as été envoyé pour arrêter les voleurs ? Eh bien, comme tu peux le voir, ils se sont déjà échappés.${prompt}
  7633: Étant donné que nous ne savons rien des voleurs, il serait futile d'envoyer une équipe de recherche.${prompt}
  7634: Cependant, un aventurier comme toi a des connexions dans bien plus d'endroits que nous.${prompt}
  7635: Interroge le jardinier. C'est le seul qui a vu les voleurs. Il pourrait te dire quelque chose d'important.${prompt}
  7636: Interroge le jardinier. C'est le seul qui a dit avoir vu les voleurs. Il pourrait te dire quelque chose qui te rappelle quelque chose.${prompt}
  7637: Ah, je te connais. Tu es cet aventurier ${name-player}. Tu veux savoir à propos des voleurs qui ont pénétré dans les chambres de la reine ?${prompt}
  7638: Eh bien, je n'ai rien vu de spécial. Tout ce que j'ai vu, ce sont deux Elvaan suspects. Quand je leur ai crié dessus, ils sont partis en courant. C'est tout.${prompt}
  7639: Mais je te jure que j'en ai vu un auparavant... Celui avec l'armure bleue...${prompt}
  7640: Chalvatot, que s'est-il passé dans les chambres de ma mère ?${prompt}
  7641: Quand je suis allé donner de l'eau aux fleurs, j'ai croisé quelques Gardes du Temple.${prompt}
  7642: Je suis désolé, Votre Altesse ! La nuit dernière, des voleurs ont pénétré dans les chambres de la défunte reine !${prompt}
  7643: Et pour aggraver les choses, les scélérats sont toujours en liberté ! Oh, que devient le jadis puissant Château d'Oraguille ?${prompt}
  7644: Je... Je ne sais pas quoi dire...${prompt}
  7645: Je savais que quelque chose n'allait pas quand j'ai trouvé le journal de ma mère à un endroit étrange...${prompt}
  7646: Votre Altesse ? Vous dites avoir vu quelque chose d'inhabituel ?${prompt}
  7647: Chalvatot, quelque chose ne va pas... Pourriez-vous venir dans mes chambres plus tard ?${prompt}
  7648: Adieu, ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame] ${name-player}. Que vous puissiez retrouver les voleurs qui ont déshonoré notre grand royaume.${prompt}
  7649: Bon retour, ${name-player}. Je suis sûr que les seigneurs des deux ordres de chevalerie voudront entendre votre rapport immédiatement.${prompt}
  7650: Donc, le sceau de Fei'Yin est brisé... Nous devons envisager la perspective de bêtes des ténèbres assiégeant cette terre, comme elles l'ont fait il y a deux décennies.${prompt}
  7651: Leurs actions ont été étranges ces derniers temps, et maintenant ça... Nous devons agir rapidement.${prompt}
  7652: Oui, mais notre obligation envers l'alliance nous interdit le déploiement unilatéral dans des terres étrangères. Les Terres du Nord ne furent-elles pas réduites en cendres lors des anciennes guerres ?${prompt}
  7653: Cela ne présage rien de bon. Nous avons surveillé cette terre avec vigilance, et pourtant cela arrive !${prompt}
  7654: Oui, j'ai bien peur que vous ayez raison. Nous avions les yeux rivés sur les allées et venues des Orques, ignorant la menace plus grande.${prompt}
  7655: Et comment expliquer cela à nos alliés ? San d'Oria ne peut devenir la risée du monde civilisé !${prompt}
  7656: De telles paroles sont-elles même nécessaires ?${prompt}
  7657: Prince Trion !${prompt}
  7658: Avant qu'ils ne nous frappent, frappons-les. Une frappe audacieuse entraverait leur élan.${prompt}
  7659: Mais, mon prince ! En envoyant des troupes dans les Terres du Nord, nous nous exposons à un certain degré de responsabilité diplomatique...${prompt}
  7660: La responsabilité !? Imbéciles ! Êtes-vous tous aveugles à ce péril ? L'ennemi approche pendant que nous discutons !${prompt}
  7661: Oui, Prince Trion... Cependant, nous devrions impliquer le roi et le Prince Pieuje dans cette décision.${prompt}
  7662: Curilla, partages-tu l'opinion de Halver et Rahal ?${prompt}
  7663: Oui, mon prince. Nous ne connaissons pas le nombre de l'ennemi. Je crois que le danger de se précipiter tête baissée dans la bataille serait trop grand.${prompt}
  7664: En effet, la nouvelle du retour du Seigneur des Ombres nous a été apportée par des aventuriers et n'est pas encore confirmée.${prompt}
  7665: Et même si cela s'avérait vrai, tous les chevaliers de San d'Oria ne suffiraient pas. Nous devons consulter l'alliance, mon prince !${prompt}
  7666: Hmph. Soit ! Toutes ces discussions sur la responsabilité diplomatique... Il y a des gens que nous devons défendre, et un ennemi que nous devons vaincre. Rien d'autre n'importe que cette simple vérité !${prompt}
  7667: En de telles circonstances, où Pieuje pourrait-il bien aller ?${prompt}
  7668: Prince Trion...${prompt}
  7669: Hmm... Nous devons nous dépêcher de décider de la politique de notre royaume. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'exploration de Fei'Yin est terminée.${prompt}
  7670: Il faudra peut-être beaucoup de temps avant que nous parvenions à une conclusion. Reposez-vous et préparez-vous pour d'autres expéditions. Et merci pour votre service dévoué.${prompt}
  7671: Ah, c'est vous, ${name-player}. Je commençais à me demander qui serait choisi pour cette prochaine mission. Vous pouvez vous rendre à la Chambre d'Audience.${prompt}
  7672: Nous attendions depuis longtemps votre arrivée, ${name-player}. Votre aide est requise dans une mission pour le Royaume.${prompt}
  7673: Où est le roi, demandez-vous ? Son Altesse s'est retirée dans ses appartements pour la journée. Récemment, il n'a pas été en bonne santé.${prompt}
  7674: Il n'est pas nécessaire de s'inquiéter de l'état de santé de mon père. Maintenant que Lightbringer est de retour à San d'Oria, le roi a commencé à montrer de grands progrès. Il devrait retrouver son état normal dans quelques jours.${prompt}
  7675: 'Quant à la raison pour laquelle vous avez été convoqué ici : le papsque vous a appelé pour mener une enquête. Sa Sainteté devrait être ici sous peu.${prompt}'
  7676: Je m'excuse pour mon retard.${prompt}
  7677: Je vous ai tous réunis aujourd'hui pour signaler une nouvelle découverte grave.${prompt}
  7678: Il semble qu'une barrière magique a été placée autour de San d'Oria ces derniers temps.${prompt}
  7679: Une barrière magique, dites-vous ?${prompt}
  7680: Et de plus, cette barrière ressemble beaucoup à celle qui a été utilisée pendant la Grande Guerre pour protéger Tavnazia de ses ennemis.${prompt}
  7681: |-
    Une “Barrière Élémentaire”...
    Assez étrange... À ma connaissance, seul un héritier du trône de Tavnazia pourrait se procurer une telle magie.${prompt}
  7682: |-
    Rochefogne...
    Ce scélérat prépare quelque chose.${prompt}
  7683: Cependant, quelles pourraient être ses motivations ? Ce mur magique--il n'a causé aucun tort au Royaume, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7684: Bien que cela soit vrai, il y a encore de nombreux aspects de ce phénomène que nous ne comprenons pas. Je pense qu'il serait imprudent de tirer des conclusions hâtives.${prompt}
  7685: Ah, et c'est pourquoi vous avez demandé l'aide de l'aventurier ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7686: C'est exact, Votre Altesse. Pour maintenir un tel mur, un médium est nécessaire en son centre. Bien que les médiums diffèrent selon le type de magie utilisée, je suis sûr qu'un est enterré quelque part près de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7687: Et son emplacement ?${prompt}
  7688: Avec San d'Oria comme centre, on peut supposer que trois médiums ont été enterrés. Autant que je puisse le déterminer, il y en aurait un dans chacune des zones de Vollbow, Valdeaunia et Norvallen...${prompt}
  7689: Si c'était moi, je les enterrerais quelque part où un aventurier serait le moins susceptible de se rendre... mais où cela pourrait-il être ?${prompt}
  7690: Votre Sainteté, on dirait que vous êtes très habile à enterrer des choses...${prompt}
  7691: J-J'ai érigé de nombreux murs magiques dans ma vie. Je ne fais qu'appeler à mon expérience passée.${prompt}
  7692: ${name-player}, vous devez faire extrêmement attention si vous tombez sur les médiums. Ils doivent être désactivés dans le bon ordre, et mon instinct me dit qu'un piège pourrait être tendu.${prompt}
  7693: Une fois de plus, le papsque nous a tous impressionnés par ses vastes connaissances sur la situation actuelle.${prompt}
  7694: |-
    Oui.
    Eh bien, ${name-player} est l'un des meilleurs aventuriers de San d'Oria. Je suis certain que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] localisera les médiums et réussira à les détruire.${prompt}
  7695: Que la Déesse vous bénisse de sa grâce lors de votre voyage.${prompt}
  7696: Avec ce Rochefogne qui court partout, nous serons obligés de reporter les Rites de Succession. Nous ne voudrions pas d'une autre scène comme celle de la cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte. Nous devons penser à la santé de notre père.${prompt}
  7697: Cependant, si ce qu'il dit est vrai, et s'il est vraiment l'héritier du Marquisat, cela signifie que nous avons le même sang...${prompt}
  7698: C'est correct, mon frère.${prompt}
  7699: |-
    Claidie !
    Tu sais très bien que tu n'as pas le droit d'interférer dans ces réunions.${prompt}
  7700: As-tu déjà oublié ? J'ai terminé ma cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte. J'ai le droit d'y assister.${prompt}
  7701: Elle a raison...${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Hah. Je m'excuse, Claidie.
    Eh bien, puisque tu es présente, donnons-nous la peine d'entendre ton avis sur la situation.${prompt}
  7703: Comme Pieuje vient de le dire, Rochefogne est notre oncle... le frère cadet de notre mère.${prompt}
  7704: C'est, si vous croyez le scélérat.${prompt}
  7705: Et c'est précisément la raison pour laquelle il est nécessaire de s'asseoir et de discuter avec lui des questions qui nous préoccupent.${prompt}
  7706: Son éclat lors de ma cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte m'a éclairé sur une partie du terrible passé de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7707: Attention à ce que tu dis, Claidie. Nous ne sommes pas tous ici de la famille royale.${prompt}
  7708: |-
    Je n'ai rien à cacher, Frère.
    Pendant la Grande Guerre, l'armée de San d'Oria a conduit les hordes de bêtes jusqu'à Tavnazia. San d'Oria a utilisé le Marquisat comme appât.${prompt}
  7709: Cependant, cette décision a été un tournant important dans la guerre. La bataille courageuse menée par les citoyens de Tavnazia a porté un coup violent aux forces des bêtes et nous a donné suffisamment de temps pour préparer nos armées.${prompt}
  7710: Oui, un tournant qui a signifié la perte de milliers de vies innocentes et la fin d'une nation fière.${prompt}
  7711: Tavnazia a été détruite lorsque l'arme secrète des bêtes a mal fonctionné. Rien, même pas les bêtes elles-mêmes, n'ont survécu à cette calamité.${prompt}
  7712: Alors pourquoi ne pas t'asseoir avec Rochefogne et lui dire cela ? Pourquoi le capturer sans être sûr de ses motivations ? Dois-je croire que c'est ainsi que la famille royale traite ses problèmes ?${prompt}
  7713: Ne te souviens-tu pas de ce qui s'est passé lors de ta cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte ? Rochefogne ne semblait pas vouloir s'asseoir et discuter autour d'une tasse de thé.${prompt}
  7714: |-
    ...
    Il doit y avoir une raison... Une raison qu'il ne pouvait pas nous dire à ce moment-là...${prompt}
  7715: Et c'est pourquoi nous devons d'abord le capturer. Seulement alors pourrons-nous éclaircir ce qui trouble nos deux côtés.${prompt}
  7716: D'accord, mais je te demande de me promettre une chose. Ne fais pas de mal à Rochefogne lorsque tu le captureras.${prompt}
  7717: Hah. Je respecterai ton souhait. Cependant, s'il lève la main sur l'un de mes chevaliers, je serai obligé d'agir.${prompt}
  7718: |-
    Oui, Frère.
    C'est tout ce que j'ai à dire.${prompt}
  7719: ${name-player}, recherche et détruis ces "médiums" dont a parlé le papsque plus tôt. Ce n'est qu'en le faisant que le Royaume sera à l'abri de la traîtrise derrière ce plan diabolique.${prompt}
  7720: |-
    Trion.
    Je pense qu'il est temps de faire appel aux services des "Cadavres des Corneilles".${prompt}
  7721: Les "Cadavres des Corneilles" ! Pieuje, es-tu fou ?${prompt}
  7722: Réfléchis, mon frère. Si nous permettons à Rochefogne de courir comme bon lui semble, les conséquences pourraient être irréparables.${prompt}
  7723: Si ${name-player} est capable de détruire la "Barrière Élémentaire", nous pouvons être sûrs que Rochefogne sera proche. Si nous prenons l'initiative, nous pourrions le capturer.${prompt}
  7724: |-
    Hmmm...
    Alors fais comme tu veux.${prompt}
  7725: Je te demande la même chose qu'à mes frères. Si tu trouves Rochefogne, je te prie de ne pas lui faire de mal. Il essaie de nous dire quelque chose, j'en suis sûr...${prompt}
  7726: |-
    <Soupir>
    Si c'est ainsi que ça doit être, alors je dois prendre les choses en main...${prompt}
  7727: Sa Majesté est tombée gravement malade ces derniers jours et se repose actuellement dans ses appartements. Pendant son absence du trône, les deux princes ont pris sa place. Cependant, les choses devraient se dérouler aussi normalement qu'avant.${prompt}
  7728: Le papsque est très certain que les objets en question se trouvent dans les régions de Vollbow, Valdeaunia et Norvallen. Vous devez traiter cette affaire avec la plus grande délicatesse. Nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre que des puissances étrangères profitent de notre situation.${prompt}
  7729: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    J'ai déjà lu le rapport de Coteaulepoint. Le fait que le corps de Rochefogne n'ait pas été retrouvé me tracasse ; cependant, je dois te féliciter pour tes efforts à désactiver la Barrière Élémentaire.${prompt}
  7730: Quant aux détails restants de ce qui s'est passé...${prompt}
  7731: |-
    Comment répondez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Entendu, Votre Altesse.
    Détails restants ?${prompt}
  7732: |-
    Excellent.
    Vous comprenez bien les questions sensibles du Royaume.${prompt}
  7733: Ne vous moquez pas de moi, ${name-player}. Vous savez très bien de quoi je parle.${prompt}
  7734: L'existence des “Cadavres des Corneilles” doit rester un secret national. Si la nouvelle de cette organisation devait parvenir aux oreilles des autres nations, les conséquences seraient graves. Et avec notre père aussi malade qu'il est...${prompt}
  7735: Notre père se sent beaucoup mieux maintenant. Il devrait bientôt retrouver sa place sur le trône.${prompt}
  7736: |-
    Les Rites de Succession sont imminents. Quand le moment sera venu, nous ferons à nouveau appel à vos services.
    Vous êtes renvoyé.${prompt}
  7737: Pieuje, que devient notre jeune sœur ?${prompt}
  7738: Elle s'est enfermée dans le jardin de notre mère...${prompt}
  7739: |-
    Hmmm...
    Elle doit réaliser que ce que nous faisons est pour le bien du Royaume.${prompt}
  7740: Trion...${prompt}
  7741: Qu'est-ce qui te tracasse, Pieuje ?${prompt}
  7742: Et si... Et si aucun de nous n'était assez digne pour retirer Lightbringer ?${prompt}
  7743: |-
    Hah hah hah !
    Tes soucis mesquins et ta prudence mesquine m'amusent, Frère.${prompt}
  7744: Ne crains rien, car il n'y a personne de plus digne que nous.${prompt}
  7745: '...${prompt}'
  7746: Qui va là ?${prompt}
  7747: |-
    Un Orc ? Pourquoi un Orc serait-il ici ?
    Bonjour ? Y a-t-il quelqu'un ?${prompt}
  7748: Les “Cadavres des Corneilles” !?${prompt}
  7749: |-
    Donc les Orcs sont arrivés jusque-là. Pas étonnant, avec le mur magique détruit...
    Cela nous force à changer nos plans.${prompt}
  7750: |-
    Espèce de scélérat !
    Quittez cet endroit immédiatement ! Vous n'avez aucun droit d'être ici !${prompt}
  7751: Je vous présente mes excuses, Votre Altesse. Cependant, je vous demande un moment de votre temps pour parler...${prompt}
  7752: Vous voulez parler... avec moi ?${prompt}
  7753: Qui... Qui êtes-vous ?${prompt}
  7754: Avec la récupération du royaulais, les Rites de Succession seront bientôt sur nous. Les préparatifs pour une telle cérémonie importante créeront de nombreuses nuits blanches pour ceux d'entre nous qui travaillent ici, au château.${prompt}
  7755: Rochefogne a été tué ? Si ce n'était pas un des Chevaliers Royaux, alors... Non, ce n'est pas possible...${prompt}
  7756: J'ai entendu les rumeurs sur le sort de Rochefogne. Cependant, je ne croirai pas qu'il est mort tant que je n'aurai pas vu le corps de mes propres yeux.${prompt}
  7757: |-
    Les Rites de Succession...
    Enfin, notre nouveau chef sera choisi...${prompt}
  7758: Nous avons doublé la garde pour les Rites de Succession. Nous ne souhaitons pas un répétition du fiasco causé par Rochefogne lors de la cérémonie de la majorité.${prompt}
  7759: Je me sens toujours responsable d'avoir laissé ce scélérat s'approcher de Sa Majesté. Cependant, sans les événements de ce jour-là, nous ne serions pas dans notre position actuelle.${prompt}
  7760: Je manque encore de jugement pour savoir ce qui est vérité, et ce qui n'est que mensonge...${prompt}
  7761: Je vois que vous êtes tous arrivés. Il ne nous reste plus qu'à attendre Claidie.${prompt}
  7762: Ah, comment va-t-il ? Comment va Rochefogne ?${prompt}
  7763: Il est toujours inconscient. Bien que le coup ait manqué ses organes vitaux, il a quand même subi beaucoup de dommages. Les médecins m'ont dit que tout ce que nous pouvions faire était de veiller et de prier...${prompt}
  7764: |-
    Je vois... Alors nous devons attendre avant de poser d'autres questions.
    Cependant, je viens d'apprendre que le rôle de Porte-Lumière dans les Rites de Succession a été conçu par le papsque lui-même...${prompt}
  7765: Il nous a menti sur la véritable inscription sur la stèle de pierre. La vraie inscription parle de la façon dont l'épée doit être protégée en tout temps et ne doit jamais être dégainée.${prompt}
  7766: Pourquoi le papsque aurait-il fabriqué de telles faussetés ?${prompt}
  7767: Le papsque en était venu à croire que Lightbringer était la clé des Portes du Paradis. Il semble que le frère de l'archiduc de Jeuno, Eald'narche, l'ait amené à le croire...${prompt}
  7768: Parce que l'épée ne peut être dégainée que par un membre de la famille royale, Sa Sainteté a conçu les Rites de Succession.${prompt}
  7769: Donc la cérémonie était un simulacre... ?${prompt}
  7770: Ça ne peut pas être vrai...${prompt}
  7771: Nous ne connaîtrons jamais l'ampleur totale de l'ambition du papsque, mais tout comme nous, il a été attiré par le pouvoir impressionnant que Lightbringer renferme dans sa lame.${prompt}
  7772: Alors qu'est-ce que... Lightbringer ?${prompt}
  7773: Pour l'instant, tout ce que nous pouvons croire est ce que Rochefogne nous a dit.${prompt}
  7774: Lightbringer est l'arme qui a ravagé Tavnazia...${prompt}
  7775: Quoi qu'il en soit, nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre de laisser les bêtes tenter de l'utiliser, même si cela nécessite l'envoi de chaque dernier soldat de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7776: Père, laissez-moi prendre le commandement de l'armée.${prompt}
  7777: Trion... ?${prompt}
  7778: C'est de ma faute si nous avons perdu Lightbringer. La responsabilité de le récupérer me revient.${prompt}
  7779: |-
    C'est moi qui ai ignoré les supplications de Claidie d'essayer de négocier avec Rochefogne. Si ce n'était pas pour ma folle fierté, rien de tout cela n'aurait jamais été amené sur San d'Oria !
    Père ! Accordez-moi la chance de me racheter !${prompt}
  7780: Modérez votre vanité, Trion !${prompt}
  7781: Père... !?${prompt}
  7782: Trion, tu danses simplement sur la scène du destin. Il est temps pour toi de descendre et d'affronter la réalité.${prompt}
  7783: Père...${prompt}
  7784: Je commanderai l'armée.${prompt}
  7785: Trion, tu te tiendras en première ligne et tu montreras aux chevaliers le véritable honneur et la vraie valeur de la famille d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  7786: Pieuje, tu maintiendras les voies d'approvisionnement, fournissant un soutien constant à la première ligne et à ton frère.${prompt}
  7787: Claidie, tu t'occuperas de Rochefogne, ainsi que tu veilleras sur lui. Il n'a pas encore gagné ma confiance.${prompt}
  7788: ${name-player}, après cette démonstration, tu dois penser que la famille royale est pitoyable. Cependant, j'ai une dernière demande à te faire. Je veux que tu te tiennes en première ligne avec Trion.${prompt}
  7789: Et enfin, nous ne devons pas oublier que nous devons être fidèles aux citoyens de ce royaume. Nous sommes sur le fondement qu'ils ont construit. Nous ne devons pas perdre leur confiance.${prompt}
  7790: |-
    Votre Altesse !
    Un de nos éclaireurs est revenu !
    Les Orcs portant Lightbringer ont été repérés entrant dans l'Arène de Qu'Bia !${prompt}
  7791: Bon travail. Dis à l'éclaireur de se reposer de son voyage.${prompt}
  7792: J'ordonne à tous nos soldats de se rendre à Fei'Yin ! Et dis-leur que le destin de San d'Oria repose sur leur bravoure !${prompt}
  7793: ${name-player} ! Nous pouvons compter sur votre aide en ce temps de besoin pour notre pays, n'est-ce pas ? Ce n'est plus une affaire qui peut être gérée par la seule famille royale !${prompt}
  7794: Au cours des années où j'ai servi en tant que Chevalier Royal, j'ai été envoyé en de nombreuses missions. Cependant, cette expédition à Fei'Yin signifie beaucoup plus pour moi que la plupart.${prompt}
  7795: Je dédie cette bataille aux chevaliers que j'ai perdus. Je ne laisserai pas le sang qu'ils ont versé être vain. Nous vaincrons nos ennemis !${prompt}
  7796: Il est temps pour les Chevaliers du Temple et les Chevaliers Royaux de mettre de côté leurs différends pour le bien du Royaume. Nous devons récupérer Lightbringer à tout prix !${prompt}
  7797: Que cette bataille ramène une fois de plus la gloire aux Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  7798: Le prince Trion est parti pour Fei'Yin. Que la grâce de la Déesse apporte la victoire aux chevaliers du Royaume !${prompt}
  7799: |-
    Le prince Pieuje est parti avec l'expédition vers Fei'Yin.
    Je ne peux que prier pour sa sécurité.${prompt}
  7800: Le prince Trion est revenu sain et sauf et attend actuellement votre arrivée dans la Salle d'Audience.${prompt}
  7801: Le prince Pieuje est rentré sans blessure et attend votre arrivée dans la Salle d'Audience.${prompt}
  7802: |-
    ${name-player} ! Je n'ai jamais douté de votre capacité sur le front. Nous vous sommes vraiment redevables.
    Rendez-vous à la Salle d'Audience. Son Altesse vous attend !${prompt}
  7803: J'ai entendu parler de vos vaillants efforts par mon fils. Ce ne serait pas exagéré de dire que votre bravoure répétée a contribué à maintenir la paix dans tout le Royaume.${prompt}
  7804: Quant à Lightbringer, tant que Rochefogne reste inconscient...${prompt}
  7805: Votre Altesse !${prompt}
  7806: Ah, Rochefogne. Claidie m'a tenu informé de votre état. Comment vous sentez-vous ?${prompt}
  7807: Je suis redevable à votre excellente fille pour tout ce qu'elle a fait pour moi.${prompt}
  7808: |-
    Votre Altesse...
    Permettez-moi de m'excuser pour tous les problèmes que j'ai causés à vous et à votre royaume.${prompt}
  7809: |-
    Vous ressemblez tant à votre sœur...
    Pardonnez-moi. Nous pensions tous que vous aviez péri pendant la Grande Guerre. Si j'avais su que vous étiez le véritable Rochefogne, nous aurions peut-être pu empêcher la perte de tant de vies.${prompt}
  7810: Votre Altesse...${prompt}
  7811: |-
    Vous pouvez vous relever, Rochefogne.
    Autant j'aimerais me remémorer le passé, je souhaite d'abord en savoir plus sur Lightbringer.${prompt}
  7812: Bien sûr.${prompt}
  7813: Il y a longtemps, le Roi Dragon, Ranperre, a confié au Marquisat de Tavnazia le devoir de protéger Lightbringer. Tous les membres de la famille royale apprennent ce devoir lors de leur cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte.${prompt}
  7814: Notre mère savait donc aussi ?${prompt}
  7815: Oui, ma sœur connaissait Lightbringer. Elle savait également que le pollen de la rose des rêves avait la capacité de neutraliser temporairement le pouvoir de la lame.${prompt}
  7816: Alors le pollen que j'ai lancé... Ma mère l'a laissé dans son testament pour de telles circonstances !${prompt}
  7817: Cependant, bien que nous connaissions notre devoir, personne à Tavnazia ne connaissait le véritable pouvoir d'une Lightbringer dégainée. On nous disait simplement de ne jamais sortir la puissante lame.${prompt}
  7818: Mais quand les forces des bêtes se sont approchées de nos portes de château...${prompt}
  7819: Ce jour fatidique où les bêtes avaient pris la ville, ma famille a tenté de s'échapper vers San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7820: Cependant, étant jeune et fier, je ne pouvais pas rester là à regarder mon pays être englouti par les flammes de la guerre. J'ai saisi Lightbringer à mon père et suis retourné au château.${prompt}
  7821: Je n'ai même pas atteint les portes de la ville... Les Orcs m'ont encerclé, et c'est alors que j'ai tiré Lightbringer de son fourreau...${prompt}
  7822: Et au moment où je l'ai fait, j'ai été enveloppé d'une lumière brillante. J'avais l'impression d'être tout-puissant... comme un dieu...${prompt}
  7823: Je ne me souviens pas combien de temps je suis resté là. Mais quand je suis revenu à moi, j'étais allongé sur une plage... et Lightbringer n'était nulle part à trouver.${prompt}
  7824: L'homme qui m'a sauvé de la mer m'a dit qu'une grande explosion avait ravagé Tavnazia, l'envoyant profondément sous l'eau.${prompt}
  7825: Il a dit que les gens pensaient que la calamité était causée par une arme Orc qui avait explosé d'elle-même, mais faute de preuves, personne ne le saurait jamais.${prompt}
  7826: Le choc de l'explosion m'avait fait perdre la mémoire, et pendant des années après ce jour-là, j'ai cru au récit de l'homme sur l'arme secrète des Orcs. Mais un jour, comme un éclair de lumière, le souvenir de ce que j'avais fait m'est revenu.${prompt}
  7827: Parce que j'avais tiré cette lame, non seulement ma famille, mais des milliers et des milliers de vies innocentes, ont été perdues.${prompt}
  7828: À partir de ce jour, je me suis fait la promesse de ne pas me reposer tant que je n'aurais pas retrouvé Lightbringer et ne l'aurais pas ramenée à sa place légitime. Alors seulement, je serais digne de mourir et de me retirer dans l'enfer que je mérite.${prompt}
  7829: Vraiment incroyable...${prompt}
  7830: Je vois... Donc le plan de San d'Oria d'attirer les forces des bêtes à Tavnazia a fonctionné parce qu'elles étaient attirées par Lightbringer.${prompt}
  7831: Mais... comment as-tu survécu à l'explosion ?${prompt}
  7832: En courant vers la ville, je suis tombé sur une belle parcelle de roses des rêves, et j'ai pensé à ma sœur. Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais j'en ai cueilli une et je l'ai mise dans ma poche de poitrine. Je pense que c'est ce qui a pu me sauver.${prompt}
  7833: Cependant, la légende de Ranperre raconte comment le Roi Dragon a utilisé Lightbringer pour apporter la paix à San d'Oria. Comment un tel instrument de bien a-t-il pu causer autant de mal ?${prompt}
  7834: Ça, je ne le sais pas -- bien que je sente que peut-être Lightbringer n'était pas destiné à nous.${prompt}
  7835: Nous devons le rendre au défunt roi et laisser décider de son sort.${prompt}
  7836: Je suis d'accord. Et j'ai le citoyen parfait pour aider à accomplir la tâche.${prompt}
  7837: ${name-player}, vous connaissez bien le plan du Tombeau du Roi Ranperre. Je vous demande de vous y rendre à l'avance et de débarrasser la zone de tout mal qui pourrait compromettre la tâche à accomplir.${prompt}
  7838: J'ai le sentiment que les Orcs pourraient nous rendre une nouvelle visite inattendue.${prompt}
  7839: Rendez-vous au Tombeau du Roi Ranperre avec prudence. Nous devons rester sur nos gardes jusqu'à ce que Lightbringer ait été rendue à son lieu de repos approprié.${prompt}
  7840: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Je n'aurais jamais cru voir le jour où les Chevaliers Royaux combattraient aux côtés d'aventuriers comme vous. Vos efforts vaillants sur le champ de bataille ont aidé à inverser la tendance en faveur de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7841: Protéger le prince tout en luttant contre l'ennemi... Je pense que même moi, je n'aurais pas été capable d'accomplir un tel exploit. J'applaudis votre compétence.${prompt}
  7842: |-
    Notre mission est enfin terminée...
    Je pense que parfois, nous, les soldats, oublions la fragilité de la vie jusqu'à ce que nous la voyions se perdre sous nos yeux sur le champ de bataille.${prompt}
  7843: |-
    Cependant, cela nous donne encore plus de raisons de continuer à nous battre. Nous ne pouvons pas laisser ceux qui nous ont quittés être oubliés.
    Si vous pouvez prendre un moment, rendez-vous à la cathédrale et offrez une prière pour les âmes qui ont donné leur vie pour la gloire du Royaume.${prompt}
  7844: Oh, ${name-player}, nous attendions votre arrivée. Son Altesse est sur le point de faire une déclaration. Veuillez prendre votre place.${prompt}
  7845: Je sais que vos corps souffrent encore de notre récente rencontre avec les Orcs.${prompt}
  7846: Cependant, j'exige toute votre attention, car j'ai une annonce importante à faire.${prompt}
  7847: J'ai décidé qu'il est dans le meilleur intérêt du Royaume de prolonger indéfiniment les Rites de Succession. Mes fils ont encore beaucoup à apprendre sur la gouvernance d'un royaume. De plus, lorsque le moment viendra pour moi de me retirer, si je trouve mes fils inadéquats, je n'hésiterai pas à choisir un héritier en dehors de la famille d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  7848: Ce ne sont pas seulement la famille royale, mais des gens comme ${name-player}, qui ont soutenu San d'Oria en silence pendant les vingt dernières années. Peut-être qu'un aventurier tel que ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] serait le mieux adapté pour le trône.${prompt}
  7849: L'arrogance des Elvaan a retenu ce pays trop longtemps. À partir d'aujourd'hui, nous reconnaîtrons nos races voisines et joindrons nos forces pour former un royaume plus fort et meilleur.${prompt}
  7850: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Je suis conscient des épreuves que vous avez dû affronter à la demande de votre pays. Cependant, vous devez comprendre que sans votre loyauté indéfectible envers le Royaume, nous n'aurions jamais pu réaliser nos erreurs.${prompt}
  7851: 'Bien que de simples objets ne puissent exprimer la gratitude que ce royaume vous doit, j’espère que vous accepterez ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} avec ma bénédiction.${prompt}'
  7852: Nous pouvons garder la tête haute en sachant qu'il y a des aventuriers comme ${name-player}, prêts à risquer leur vie pour le bien du Royaume.${prompt}
  7853: Il est maintenant temps pour les citoyens de San d'Oria de faire leur part.${prompt}
  7854: Grâce à vos efforts, le château a retrouvé ce sentiment de paix qu'il avait perdu depuis si longtemps.${prompt}
  7855: J'ai peut-être été strict avec vous lorsque vous étiez encore un aventurier novice. Cependant, je souhaite que vous oubliez tout cela. Je n'ai maintenant que le plus grand respect pour vous.${prompt}
  7856: Il reste encore beaucoup de travail à faire, mais vous pouvez nous laisser cela. Nous ne voulons pas vous retenir des nouvelles aventures qui vous attendent.${prompt}
  7857: Maintenant que Lightbringer a été scellé dans la tombe du Roi Dragon, l'activité des Orcs a commencé à diminuer. Nous enverrons bientôt des soldats pour débarrasser la terre des hordes restantes.${prompt}
  7858: Autant votre présence en première ligne serait la bienvenue, nous ne pouvons pas courir vers vous pour résoudre toutes nos crises nationales.${prompt}
  7859: Cependant, je m'attends à ce qu'un jour le Royaume ait de nouveau besoin de vos services. Mais jusqu'à ce jour, que la lumière de la Déesse brille sur vous !${prompt}
  7860: Le conflit avec les Orcs touche peut-être enfin à sa fin, mais je doute qu'une paix immédiate suive. Nous, les Chevaliers du Temple, devons rester vigilants à tout moment, de peur que le danger ne se manifeste dans les limites de notre noble royaume.${prompt}
  7861: ${name-player}, ne songeriez-vous pas à rejoindre nos rangs ? Vous avez beaucoup de potentiel inexploité.${prompt}
  7862: |-
    Rejoindre les Chevaliers du Temple ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7863: Bien que je sois flatté par votre enthousiasme, je sais que vous ne seriez pas satisfait d'être lié par les devoirs des chevaliers. Votre place est sous les cieux ouverts de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7864: Comme je m'y attendais. Je sais que vous ne seriez pas satisfait d'être lié par les devoirs des chevaliers. Votre place est sous les cieux ouverts de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7865: Maintenant allez-y ! L'aventure vous attend !${prompt}
  7866: La bataille a épuisé nos chevaliers. Je suis soulagé qu'il n'y ait pas d'autres expéditions dans un avenir proche... mais ne dites pas à Sir Rahal que j'ai dit cela.${prompt}  
  7867: Dame Curilla et les Chevaliers du Temple ont trouvé Lightbringer... Qui aurait pensé qu'elle se trouverait en un tel endroit ? ${prompt}
  7868: Nous, les chevaliers, devons garder nos sens aiguisés et nos lames encore plus aiguisées. Si nous laissons l'un ou l'autre s'émousser, cela pourrait signifier notre vie !${prompt}
  7869: La bataille à Fei'Yin a porté un coup féroce aux Orcs. Je pense que le moment est venu de finir ces démons une fois pour toutes. Le jour de la paix est enfin arrivé !${prompt}
  7870: La défaite du Seigneur des Ombres devrait améliorer la situation dans les Northlands et améliorer nos chances dans la guerre contre les Orcs.${prompt}
  7871: Il n'y a pas un chevalier à San d'Oria qui ne souhaite prendre Lightbringer dans ses mains. Cependant, il reste encore de nombreux mystères qui l'entourent...${prompt}
  7872: Il est maintenant temps de montrer à ces Orcs la véritable force des Chevaliers Royaux. La bataille entrera dans l'histoire comme le jour où nous avons mis fin à leurs complots diaboliques !${prompt}
  7873: Quand j'étais dans les Northlands, je ne savais pas si je reviendrais un jour ici, en train de boire du thé dans le confort de mes quartiers. Je lève mon verre à mes collègues qui n'ont pas eu cette chance...${prompt}
  7874: Je ne savais pas que Son Altesse ressentait cela pour le Royaume... Mettre la stabilité du pays avant les lignées et les traditions... le royaulais est vraiment un grand leader.${prompt}
  7875: ${name-player}, vous avez ma gratitude pour m'avoir sauvé la vie dans l'Arène de Qu'Bia.${prompt}
  7876: Les Chevaliers Royaux ont acculé les Orcs. Notre conflit avec les démons sera bientôt résolu. Autant que je souhaite être en première ligne avec mes camarades soldats, j'ai de nombreuses nouvelles responsabilités à affronter ici au château.${prompt}
  7877: Je pourrais, encore une fois, avoir besoin de vos services. D'ici là, que la Déesse fasse briller Sa gloire sur vous dans vos voyages.${prompt} 
  7878: Comme mon père l'a dit, vous pourriez être plus adapté que moi pour diriger notre royaume...${prompt}
  7879: Cependant, que je me tienne ou non au sommet de San d'Oria n'est pas important. Cette situation avec Rochefogne, Lightbringer, et les Orcs m'a beaucoup appris sur ce qui me manque en tant que leader.${prompt}
  7880: Trop souvent, j'ai compté sur votre bravoure et votre loyauté. Si ce n'était pas pour vos actions vaillantes, j'aurais sûrement péri dans les Northlands.${prompt}
  7881: Si vos voyages vous ramènent un jour ici à San d'Oria, vous serez toujours le bienvenu. Pas en tant qu'aventurier, mais en tant qu'ami.${prompt}
  7882: J'ai entendu de mon frère parler de votre bravoure à Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7883: Votre succès sur le champ de bataille ne cesse de m'étonner. Il y a beaucoup de choses que je pourrais apprendre de vous...${prompt}
  7884: Je vous félicite pour l'accomplissement de cette mission, et je m'excuse de peser constamment sur vos aventures avec de nouvelles responsabilités.${prompt}
  7885: Cependant, vos réalisations ont été, et seront, cruciales pour la prospérité du Royaume. Je sens que votre amour pour San d'Oria est grand.${prompt}
  7886: Ne pas prêter nos oreilles aux pensées et aux opinions des autres, penser seulement que nous avons raison...${prompt}
  7887: Cependant, je réalise maintenant que c'est le péché dont nous, les Elvaans, sommes coupables... C'est pourquoi je vous demande de nous guider. Si vous sentez qu'il y a une erreur dans nos manières, n'hésitez pas à nous en informer.${prompt}
  7888: J'utiliserai vos mots pour façonner ce pays en une terre dont vous, vos enfants ou les enfants de vos enfants ne serez pas honteux.${prompt}
  7889: Eh bien, ${name-player}. Vous êtes devenu un sacré combattant depuis notre dernière rencontre. Je peux le dire en jetant simplement un coup d'œil à vos bras. Ce sont les membres de quelqu'un qui a passé de nombreuses heures à perfectionner ${choice-player-gender}[ses compétences/sa compétence].${prompt}
  7890: Cependant, si vous deviez participer aux tournois du Royaume, vous seriez certainement éliminé lors des tours préliminaires.${prompt}
  7891: |-
    Je sens un soupçon de question dans vos yeux. Laissez-moi expliquer...
    Ce qui distingue les champions du commun des mortels réside dans l'acquisition d'une seule technique.${prompt}
  7892: Cette technique est...
  7893: Dame Curilla ! Nous avons terminé notre patrouille du périmètre ! Rien à signaler !
  7894: Bien compris. Informez les gardes en attente de commencer leur service. Vous pouvez vous reposer dans vos quartiers jusqu'à ce que vous soyez appelé.
  7895: Oui, Dame Curilla !
  7896: Uh...um...Dame Curilla ?
  7897: Que voulez-vous ? Avez-vous autre chose à signaler ?
  7898: Qui est cet aventurier...?
  7899: Voulez-vous dire ${name-player} ? ${choice-player-gender}[Ses/Son] compétences avec la lame à une main sont devenues assez renommées dans tout le Royaume. Je réfléchis à savoir si je devrais lui enseigner la technique finale et le recommander pour les tournois.
  7900: La technique finale !? Vous ne pensez pas que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] pourrait vraiment...
  7901: Hah hah. Votre formation à la technique vous a transformé d'un écuyer maladroit en fier chevalier que vous êtes aujourd'hui. Qui sait si ${name-player} ne pourra pas relever le défi ?
  7902: C'est vrai, mais...mais, ${name-player} n'est qu'un aventurier. Si ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] devait être blessé pendant l'entraînement, pensez aux répercussions...
  7903: |-
    Do I look as if I have not considered the repercussions? Do you wish to suggest that my judgment is erroneous?
    Now off with you! Sufficient rest is an essential part of your duties!${prompt}
  7904: Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt}
  7905: <Sigh>...${prompt}
  7906: I apologize for the interruption. However, my offer remains. If you wish to continue with your training in the way of the sword, I will assist. The knights may seem to think differently, but I assure you you need not worry.${prompt}
  7907: Take this sword. It will bless you with its power until it senses that your skills have matured. Only then you will be ready to learn the final technique.${prompt}
  7908: |-
    Will you partake in this trial?
    ${selection-lines}
    I would be honored.
    Not just yet...${prompt}
  7909: Positive was I of your answer before you even spoke it. I can sense your desire for knowledge and power.${prompt}
  7910: Now take up in your hands this sword and begin your training.${prompt}
  7911: When you feel that the sword has recognized your might, return to me with the weakened blade. I will judge whether or not your journey is over.${prompt}
  7912: |-
    However, that is when the true trial will begin...
    I wish you luck, but you must remember it is not luck, but skill and perseverance, that will lead you back to this hall.${prompt}
  7913: So there is still doubt in your heart. Irresolution can be a deadly thing on the battlefield. I advise you purge yourself of this trait before setting out on any more adventures.${prompt}
  7914: 'I do not yet feel that the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has recognized your true strength. You have much road yet to travel.${prompt}'
  7915: Ah, ${name-player}. “Trade” me the sword if you wish me to evaluate your progress. Or is there another reason why you have called?${prompt}
  7916: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    I've misplaced the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    I wish to end my training.
    I apologize for the disturbance.${prompt}
  7917: The blade that you have “misplaced” was specially ordered for the training of the San d'Orian knights. A large sum of the Kingdom's tax money was used to purchase it. What you have done could be considered a crime!${prompt}
  7918: <Sigh> But it was I who made the decision to begin your training, therefore I will take responsibility for your actions this time. However, If you do not wish to travel to each and every one of our citizens' residences and make a personal apology for squandering their hard-earned gil, I suggest that you be more careful in the future.${prompt}
  7919: You cannot be serious! Think of the opportunity you are passing by! I will give you one more chance...${prompt}
  7920: |-
    Do you really want to end your training?
    ${selection-lines}
    I am positive.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  7921: Excellent. I am not sure of your intentions today, but if you were searching for kind words of moral support, you will not find them here. Such gibberish can only bind one and lead them to a false sense of success.${prompt}
  7922: I see... I have trained many knights, and among them have been many who put down their swords just as you have. However, with time, those knights have faded into obscurity, their decision haunting them day in and day out.${prompt}
  7923: If you do not wish to join their ranks, return here, and I will reconsider your training. I believe that you will make the correct decision.${prompt}
  7924: Ah yes, this sword sings of your strength and courageousness. I can see that you are ready for any challenge put forth before you.${prompt}
  7925: However, as I mentioned before, the true trial has yet to begin. It is now time to prove your skill. Normally we would send a pair of knights to complete this final task, but you are strong enough to take on the burden alone.${prompt}
  7926: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set forth to the Quicksand Caves. There you shall find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Be thorough in your preparations, as your greatest challenge awaits you.${prompt}'
  7927: |-
    You will no longer require the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. You may return it to me. I will watch over it as you continue your training.
    Good luck, and may the Goddess shine her light of grace upon you in battle.${prompt}
  7928: 'Take that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set forth to the Quicksand Caves. There you shall find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Be thorough in your preparations, as your greatest challenge awaits you.${prompt}'
  7929: I applaud you in your completion of the trial. You now have acquired enough skill to wield the final technique.${prompt}
  7930: However, you must not be content. I still feel that you are not yet ready for the grueling challenges that await you at the tourneys.${prompt}
  7931: I remember when I took part in the competition. I wanted to prove my power to the Kingdom. I wanted to prove that there was no one who could match me...${prompt}
  7932: However, that display was only a measure of how weak I actually was...${prompt}
  7933: During the championship match, I was possessed with the lust for victory. That lust powered me, and when I brought down my blade onto Prince Trion, the force was so great that it shattered his weapon.${prompt}
  7934: But as it shattered, a piece of the broken sword flew into my left eye, darkening it for eternity. While I did not lose my life, I had lost something just as important to a knight--my eyesight.${prompt}
  7935: Though I did not let this stand in my way. I continued my training, and just like you, acquired the final technique. And through my training, I learned to rely on more than that which reflects in the eye. I learned to feel what lies in my opponent's heart...${prompt}
  7936: I see that the battle between you and my brother is still being waged.${prompt}
  7937: P-Prince Pieuje! How long have you been...${prompt}
  7938: I just arrived, Curilla. I was beginning to wonder why our captain of the Temple Knights had failed to make her daily report.${prompt}
  7939: |-
    ...!
    I apologize for my tardiness! It will never happen again!${prompt}
  7940: It seems as if you remain weighted down by the burdens you have placed upon your conscience.${prompt}
  7941: Weighted down... Again, I apologize, but I do not believe that is so.${prompt}
  7942: Hah hah. You differ not from my dear brother. The shards of the blade that shattered that day still remain lodged within your hearts.${prompt}
  7943: And so you remain at a distance...neither of you the victor in your ongoing battle.${prompt}
  7944: '...${prompt}'
  7945: Forget what I have said. I will be waiting in my chambers for your report.${prompt}
  7946: Yes, Your Highness.${prompt}
  7947: Curilla, you said that you had “learned to feel what lies in your opponent's heart.” I think that you had best spend some time pondering over those words once again. You may find that you have been missing their true meaning.${prompt}
  7948: I know what those words mean. I know exactly what they mean...${prompt}
  7949: I do not regret losing my eye in that competition. I do not feel that I would be alive today, were it not for all I learned due to that accident.${prompt}
  7950: However, every time I take up my sword, I can feel the dull, throbbing pain it brings to my soul.${prompt}
  7951: |-
    I do not wish for you to make the same mistake as I... I apologize, but I have decided not to recommend you for the tourneys. I am sure there are other adventures more worthy of your newfound skill than a foolish game.
    I wish you all the best in your journeys, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7952: You have learned the weapon skill “Savage Blade”!${prompt}
  7953: Ah, adventurer. I was told of your cooperation in apprehending the thief.${prompt}
  7954: The interrogation is just about to begin. If he is indeed guilty of the crime, you shall receive a reward.${prompt}
  7955: Come with me.${prompt}
  7956: Two years after his defeat at the Second Battle of Konschtat, King Raigegue massed his remaining knights in La Theine and awaited an opportunity to retaliate against Bastok.${prompt}
  7957: It was as you say.${prompt}
  7958: However, seizing upon his brother's absence, Prince Fellenant mobilized the Temple Knights and took control of the city of San d'Oria. He demanded a peace treaty be drawn up with Bastok, correct?${prompt}
  7959: That is correct.${prompt}
  7960: Fearing an internecine war, the king decided to send the Scepter Royaulais to Prince Fellenant and abdicate in his favor. His only condition was that the city be released from military control.${prompt}
  7961: Yes, we were on our way to bring the scepter to Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  7962: '...When you were beset by a wild storm and took shelter within Ordelle''s Caves...I believe this is how your story goes.${prompt}'
  7963: And what manner of artifact is this Scepter Royaulais you speak of?${prompt}
  7964: Do you not know even this? It is a beautiful scepter with a rare jewel known as the Pierre Errante set at its end. It requires the most careful handling so as not to mar the stone.${prompt}
  7965: '...${prompt}'
  7966: |-
    Will you accept my words as truth now?
    You must allow me audience with Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  7967: |-
    Deluded fantasies...
    Do you honestly expect to fool us with this fabrication?${prompt}
  7968: |-
    How dare you!
    You accuse me of lying!?${prompt}
  7969: The Second Battle of Konschtat? King Raigegue and Prince Fellenant? This goes beyond all patience!${prompt}
  7970: Then simply wait for the arrival of the Royal Knights who traveled with me--the Cardinal Stags! We were separated in Ordelle's Caves, but they should be arriving in the city at any moment.${prompt}
  7971: Well, isn't that interesting? Captain Guichantmarge of the Cardinal Stags is a good friend of mine, and I have no recollection of seeing your face among his troops when I performed an inspection. Neither do I recall hearing of any new recruits.${prompt}
  7972: Surely you jest, sir!${prompt}
  7973: The Captain of the Cardinal Stags, as all should know, is Sir Plieucherot. Enough of these games!${prompt}
  7974: Monarlais Halver, what are we to do with this individual?${prompt}
  7975: |-
    He is obviously not the person shown in the sketch we have of the thief, nor do the guards of the royal treasury recognize him as the criminal.
    We cannot throw him into a cell merely because he has knowledge of the Scepter Royaulais.${prompt}
  7976: Yet word of that other matter has not leaked beyond our walls. Are we to just let this man go...?${prompt}
  7977: Hmmm... However, I do not believe this fool would have had the finesse required to slip into the treasury. It was open for but a few moments when we removed that other object...${prompt}
  7978: |-
    My sincerest apologies, sir.
    We were taken completely unawares. Only one who had extensive knowledge of the castle could have evaded us in such a way... It was no ordinary burglar.${prompt}
  7979: |-
    Do you still doubt me?
    I am here on orders from the king. Or is this how the prince treats envoys that appear on his doorstep?${prompt}
  7980: Remove him from the chateau. I have not the time nor the patience to deal with his delusions.${prompt}
  7981: Sir.${prompt}
  7982: |-
    I am under orders from the king...
    What are you...? Release me at once!${prompt}
  7983: Mark my words! I, Vijartal Caphieux, have been insulted too many times this day! Your apologies will fall on deaf ears when next we meet!${prompt}
  7984: |-
    Wait one moment...
    What did you just say?${prompt}
  7985: I said to remember the name of Vijartal Caphieux! I will never forget the disgraces I was forced to endure at your hands!${prompt}
  7986: This is an outrage!${prompt}
  7987: The name of the revered hero of San d'Oria used in vain by this common bandit! Have you no honor!?${prompt}
  7988: What is this you speak of?${prompt}
  7989: |-
    Simpleton!
    That is the name of the great man who ended the war between the Royal and Temple Knights two hundred years ago! Even a child would not tell such a scandalous lie!${prompt}
  7990: |-
    Get out of my sight!
    The next time you show your face in my presence, I will not be held responsible for my actions!${prompt}
  7991: |-
    What do you mean, “two hundred years ago”?
    Explain yourself. Why am I considered a hero...?${prompt}
  7992: I am sorry, but I cannot pay you a reward. He is not the man we are looking for.${prompt}
  7993: "However, we must retrieve the scepter at any cost. \nIt is an invaluable treasure. The symbol of San d'Oria.${prompt}"
  7994: 'Give that gate guard a message for me: he still has a chance to prove himself.${prompt}'
  7995: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I require your keen eye and tireless endurance in a most important matter!${prompt}
  7996: You see, I was speaking with His Majesty just the other day...${prompt}
  7997: You sent for me, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  7998: |-
    Halver, it is most troublesome. There is something I must confer with you about.
    Nay, rather I have a request for you.${prompt}
  7999: Yes, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  8000: |-
    Ahem. Well, how do I begin?
    Do you recall the day when my beloved Leaute first came to the chateau?${prompt}
  8001: Why, of course. The chateau was buzzing with rumors of the lovely Tavnazian princess that was destined to be our next queen.${prompt}
  8002: |-
    At the time I was but a lowly student, and I snuck out of a lecture to catch a glimpse of her noble countenance...
    In the end, I skipped the entire class to see the royal parade.${prompt}
  8003: I managed to view Queen Leaute's fair profile from the gathered crowd. That image is still burned into my mind even now.${prompt}
  8004: I never dreamed that I would end up working so closely with the beautiful princess I saw that day. Queen Leaute would always smile and have a kind word for me...${prompt}
  8005: Halver. I wasn't asking you for a rambling trip down memory lane.${prompt}
  8006: Ah, my apologies, Your Majesty. Was this request related in some way to the queen?${prompt}
  8007: |-
    This has nothing to do with Leaute.
    I wanted to speak with you about a new queen.${prompt}
  8008: |-
    !!!
    Again, I must apologize for not seeing straight to the heart of the matter, Your Majesty.${prompt}
  8009: Hrmph. I thought perhaps it was time the subject was broached.${prompt}
  8010: Ah... Well, Your Majesty has been alone for quite some time now. I am sure that your late wife would completely understand.${prompt}
  8011: Yes, I do not doubt that Leaute has been uneasy in her eternal rest. Halver, I want you to search for a suitable lady to become the future Queen of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8012: |-
    Me, Your Majesty?
    I...I am honored that you would place that kind of trust in me, but I'm not sure...
    Ahem. If Your Majesty commands it, I will do my utmost to fulfill this duty.${prompt}
  8013: And what qualities would be desirable for the lady to possess?${prompt}
  8014: Hmmm. Naturally, she must have a compassionate heart for all of our subjects, as did my dear Leaute.${prompt}
  8015: |-
    Your Majesty, even now your thoughts are with her...
    It makes my heart ache to think of the loss you must be feeling.${prompt}
  8016: This is a somewhat difficult question, but should the lady be blessed in appearance? A person of similar features to Queen Leaute?${prompt}
  8017: |-
    It is said that men always look for the image of their mother, however...
    These things you should be asking of the lady's future husband. Finding out his preferences will be part of this task.${prompt}
  8018: First, I must talk to the future husband...${prompt}
  8019: '...Future husband? Image of their mother? Your Majesty, what exactly are we talking about here?${prompt}'
  8020: Haven't you been listening, Halver? We are speaking of Trion's bride-to-be!${prompt}
  8021: Of course, it is yet to be decided whether or not Trion is to succeed me. However, it is a distinct possibility. It will be necessary to find Pieuje a bride as well, but for the moment I believe we should search for a fitting consort for Crown Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8022: |-
    Prince Trion...
    So that is what this is all about. I thought our conversation peculiar...${prompt}
  8023: "The only peculiar thing around here is you, Halver! \nIn any case, I entrust you with the duty of finding Trion a suitable wife and arranging an introduction.${prompt}"
  8024: This need not be so difficult if Trion is merely made aware of the fact that he has approached a marriageable age.${prompt}
  8025: Aha... Only, I have never spoken with Prince Trion on the subject of his...preferences.${prompt}
  8026: |-
    ...I have it!
    This may seem presumptuous of me, but what of my own daughter? She is kindhearted and fair of face.${prompt}
  8027: She has perhaps been of marriageable age for a little longer than usual, as I pondered which house would be the best for her to marry into...${prompt}
  8028: Ahahaha! Halver, have you developed a sense of humor over the years?${prompt}
  8029: A sense of humor...? I assure you, I am most seriou--${prompt}
  8030: I never thought you were the type to indulge in comedy. You must entertain us with your jests at the next banquet.${prompt}
  8031: Now, as for Trion's preferences. This is quite a quandary, isn't it?${prompt}
  8032: '...${prompt}'
  8033: I'm well aware of Trion's taste in ladies.${prompt}
  8034: Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  8035: My brother's predilections are obvious if you have spent as much time with him as I have.${prompt}
  8036: "Of course, who would know better than his own brother? \nWell? Out with it then, Pieuje.${prompt}"
  8037: My brother...${prompt}
  8038: He seems to think that a well-traveled, free-spirited adventurer would make the best partner for him.${prompt}
  8039: An adventurer! I must say, this is a surprise. I would have thought that a nobleman's daughter or the princess of a distant land would be more...${prompt}
  8040: |-
    Hmm, things have certainly changed since my day. Mayhap this is the best choice for him.
    Halver, continue this discussion with Pieuje and seek out a girl that matches Trion's interests.${prompt}
  8041: Pieuje, not a word of this to your brother. He will become obstinate if he finds that we have been having this discussion without his knowledge.${prompt}
  8042: Of course, Father. I am well aware of his stubbornness.${prompt}
  8043: '...And that is the predicament I am in.${prompt}'
  8044: ${name-player}. As I have explained, we are looking for a fitting bride for Crown Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8045: According to Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  8046: Prince Trion prefers Hume girls with blonde hair that almost hides the eyebrows and is tied back in a short ponytail.${prompt}
  8047: Prince Trion prefers Hume girls with brown hair that almost hides the eyebrows and is tied back in a short ponytail.${prompt}

  8163: I do feel sorry for the Temple Knight who draws Curilla as a fencing partner, however.${prompt}

    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I am delighted to see you have shown interest in our fine exercise.${prompt}
  8175: I can assume you have already been informed of the finer details of Conflict, can I not?${prompt}
  8176: The three nations are finally at peace. Tension between the people of Vana'diel is the last thing any of us wish. However, while only a simple exercise, a game such as Ballista could be misinterpreted by some as a direct attack on an ally.${prompt}
  8177: That is where you adventurers come in. Your minds are still clear, your spirits fresh. You are not controlled by petty politics and hidden agendas. It is you who have the opportunity to become the true heroes of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  8178: Ah, but to think I would live to see the day Conflict was reinstated. Just thinking of the heated battle makes my heart race with excitement.${prompt}

    My only regret is that due to my age, I will be unable to fight by your side.${prompt}

  8190: When I learned that adventurers from Bastok would be taking part in Conflict, I was looking forward to seeing what kind of brute warrior the Republic would send. But if this is all my Hume companions have to offer, I can be only more positive that the forces of San d'Oria will be victorious.${prompt}
  8191: In recent years our two nations have been on amicable terms. However, I do not feel that any of my loyal citizens have forgotten what transpired in the Konschtat Highlands.${prompt}
  8192: When I learned that adventurers from Windurst would be taking part in Conflict, I was looking forward to seeing what kind of mighty sorcerer the Federation would send. But if this is all my Tarutaru companions have to offer, I can be only more positive that the forces of San d'Oria will be victorious.${prompt}
  8193: In recent years San d'Oria and Windurst have been on amicable terms. However, I do not feel that any of my loyal citizens have forgotten the bitter history that stains our nations' past.${prompt}
  8194: Ballista is the perfect opportunity to help erase the unwanted feelings of spite between us. But this does not mean my Kingdom's forces will show pity to their opponents. I will grant you the opportunity to withdraw your participation, if you wish.${prompt}

  8254: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8255: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8256: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8257: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8258: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8259: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8260: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8261: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8262: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8263: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8264: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8265: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8266: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8267: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8268: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8269: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8270: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8271: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8272: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8273: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8274: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8275: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8276: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8277: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8278: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8279: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8280: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8281: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8282: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  8283: |-
    It appears the Empire of Aht Urhgan is desperate to recruit mercenaries.
    I assume that is the function of the badge you wear?${prompt}
  8284: |-
    And how would I know such a thing, you ask?
    Through the now ruined nation of Tavnazia, San d'Oria once had much traffic with the Near East.${prompt}
  8285: |-
    Those ties persist to this day, and we yet maintain a perfunctory level of international diplomacy.
    All manner of information makes its way to my ears.${prompt}
  8286: |-
    However, there is one thing I struggle to understand.
    Why would a nation with enough military power to have her neighbors trembling in fear need to ask for assistance...?${prompt}
  8287: |-
    A badge of that despicable mercenary outfit in here?
    You show a surprising lack of discretion, adventurer.${prompt}
  8288: |-
    Or so I should like to say to even my own knights.
    There are those within our ranks that have felt the lure of mercenary wages.${prompt}
  8289: |-
    I would hope their oaths as protectors of the Kingdom were taken more seriously.
    No matter--I am certain this temptation will strike but once, then leave our knights stronger for the experience.${prompt}
  8290: |-
    Is that one of those Near Eastern badges!?
    Remove it at once!
    If Prince Trion were to see you wearing one of those...${prompt}
  8291: Seeing all these people sporting mercenary badges has him in a volatile mood.${prompt}
  8292: You wear a badge of the land of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  8293: Queen Leaute brought many plants from her homeland of Tavnazia to fill this garden, including a few that originated in the Near East.${prompt}
  8294: |-
    That one there with the large flowers is such a specimen.
    I hear they enhance the blooms with alchemical processes.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Ever since that recruiter from Aht Urhgan arrived, the chateau has been in an uproar.
    Especially Prince Tri--${prompt}
  8296: |-
    Be on your way, adventurer.
    I'll thank you to forget what you have heard here.${prompt}
  8297: |-
    So, you are ${name-player}.
    The guards tell me you were the one to deliver this letter...${prompt}
  8298: |-
    ${name-player}.
    As you are likely aware, all matters concerning the royal family pass through me.${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Show him ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a chance.${prompt}
  8300: Hmmm. I had heard that the Empire of Aht Urhgan was desperately recruiting mercenaries, but to see one of their insignias with my own eyes...${prompt}
  8301: ${name-player}, you have become a mercenary, have you not?${prompt}
  8302: What have we here?${prompt}
  8303: A letter...with writing so terrible I cannot even read that I am the intended recipient.${prompt}
  8304: |-
    This carrion worm scrawl...
    I have seen its like before...${prompt}
  8305: The person who entrusted you with this message...${prompt}
  8306: The “Lord of Illegibility,” as I would call him...${prompt}
  8307: |-
    Ahaha...
    I should not say such things of our dear prince...${prompt}
  8308: Though I am correct, am I not...?${prompt}
  8309: This letter is from the heir to the throne of San d'Oria, the Prince Royal, Trion I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  8310: '!?${prompt}'
  8311: |-
    It cannot be...
    That awful penmanship...${prompt}
  8312: |-
    I am certain...
    This letter is from the heir to the throne of San d'Oria, the Prince Royal, Trion I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  8313: I am mistaken, you say?${prompt}
  8314: |-
    This letter was written by one Sage Raillefal?
    But this chocobo scratch could only be the work of Prince Trion...${prompt}
  8315: |-
    I shall prove it to you.
    I have long attended to the prince and encountered many opportunities to decipher his...unique...style of writing...${prompt}
  8316: A moment, if you will...${prompt}
  8317: '...${prompt}'
  8318: ???${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Astril Condes...?
    Astrul Wand...?
    Uar...?${prompt}
  8320: This truly is atrocious...${prompt}
  8321: I have no doubt this letter is from Prince Trion!${prompt}
  8322: But I am afraid I cannot make out the meaning...${prompt}
  8323: |-
    Monarlais Halver.
    You look troubled. Perhaps I may be of assistance?${prompt}
  8324: '!${prompt}'
  8325: |-
    General Rahal.
    Your offer of aid is most generous, however...${prompt}
  8326: |-
    No need to be so humble.
    You have one of Trion's indecipherable letters, do you not?${prompt}
  8327: How could you know...?${prompt}
  8328: I have my sources...${prompt}
  8329: Some days ago, Prince Trion abandoned the signing of some official documents...${prompt}
  8330: He placed a mannequin in his chair, and fled the chateau in the dead of night...${prompt}
  8331: At least it was not a forest hare this time...${prompt}
  8332: |-
    That is when I had Travialce here shadow the prince's movements.
    He has had training in the arts of the ninja.${prompt}
  8333: Please continue the tale, Travialce.${prompt}
  8334: |-
    Sir.
    Prince Trion first made his way to Mhaura and passed himself off as an adventurer.${prompt}
  8335: |-
    Dear Altana...
    A member of the royal family traipsing about as an “adventurer”...${prompt}
  8336: The court will be mortified.${prompt}
  8337: From there, His Highness boarded a ferry bound for the shores of Aht Urhgan...${prompt}
  8338: |-
    Aht Urhgan!?
    And then?${prompt}
  8339: I quickly slipped aboard as well, and guarded the royal person from the shadows.${prompt}
  8340: The ferry safely arrived in Al Zahbi with the prince none the wiser of my presence.${prompt}
  8341: After entering the city, Prince Trion headed straight to a mercenary company and apparently signed some sort of contract.${prompt}
  8342: |-
    A contract!?
    Surely not with his own name? This could escalate into an international crisis!${prompt}
  8343: |-
    There is nothing to fear on that count.
    His Highness travels the Empire under the assumed name of “Raillefal.”${prompt}
  8344: So no one in Al Zahbi is aware of his true identity?${prompt}
  8345: |-
    I wouldn't say that, milord...
    The prince is wearing a suit of gilded gold plate and is not subtle in his information gathering.${prompt}
  8346: |-
    Great Goddess...
    Then he is not disguised at all?${prompt}
  8347: No, milord.${prompt}
  8348: Come to think of it, I have seen this adventurer's face in the very same mercenary company...${prompt}
  8349: This letter must be the very same document I witnessed in the prince's hand at the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt}
  8350: I am wounded that Prince Trion does not have more trust in us, his loyal subjects...${prompt}
  8351: And I do wish he would act with a little more discretion.${prompt}
  8352: That is a matter we shall discuss anon...${prompt}
  8353: First, we must learn the reason for Prince Trion's seemingly frequent trips to the nation of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  8354: |-
    What is the current state of the Near East?
    Is the prince in any danger?${prompt}
  8355: Do not be concerned.${prompt}
  8356: |-
    I am sure that Travialce has learned much from following the prince.
    Please enlighten us.${prompt}
  8357: |-
    Sir.
    Raillefal...ah, Prince Trion, investigated the following facts.${prompt}
  8358: Four years ago, Jalzahn, the former Emperor of Aht Urhgan, and his wife both succumbed to the same illness...${prompt}
  8359: |-
    Yes, I remember...
    The Kingdom of San d'Oria sent her condolences.
    The illness was quite virulent, as I recall...${prompt}
  8360: The beastmen who dwell on the western borders of the nation used this as an opportunity to cease offering tributes.${prompt}
  8361: |-
    Hmph.
    What more would you expect from those savages?${prompt}
  8362: Though the Empire's long war with the eastern nations was at a stalemate, they could not afford to grow complacent.${prompt}
  8363: The main body of the Imperial Army remained focused on the east...${prompt}
  8364: Meanwhile, the beastmen of the Mamool Ja Savagelands and Halvung Territory unfurled a banner of rebellion on the abandoned western front. It was not long before they were joined by an army known as the “Undead Swarm”...${prompt}
  8365: The military might of San d'Oria is fully occupied with the Orcish horde alone. If it were three separate armies...${prompt}
  8366: Even a mighty nation like Aht Urhgan must flounder...${prompt}
  8367: |-
    Of a certain, sir.
    The capital itself has recently been the target of beastman invasions.${prompt}
  8368: Aht Urhgan now finds herself without the resources to even repair the walls of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  8369: No matter how impressive a swordsman Prince Trion is, we cannot allow him to remain in such a dangerous place.${prompt}
  8370: I must take this matter up with those responsible for protecting the royal household.${prompt}
  8371: Bring me General Curilla!${prompt}
  8372: General Curilla. It appears a member of the Royal Knights has managed to track down the location of our wayward prince.${prompt}
  8373: And where, pray tell, would that be?${prompt}
  8374: The Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  8375: Aht Urhgan...${prompt}
  8376: The nation recruiting mercenaries?${prompt}
  8377: Yes.${prompt}
  8378: Then it stands to reason that the Temple Knights should stand little chance of finding the prince.${prompt}
  8379: I seem to recall ordering you to take measures that would prevent this sort of thing from happening again. Am I mistaken?${prompt}
  8380: |-
    No, Monarlais Halver.
    I have been derelict in my duty.${prompt}
  8381: It is good that you recognize your failings, but you shall be made to take responsibility for this situation.${prompt}
  8382: Yes, milord.${prompt}
  8383: Forgive my directness, Monarlais Halver, but I feel I must ask.${prompt}
  8384: Why would Prince Trion travel to such a distant land? Does he feel so strongly about the Empire?${prompt}
  8385: Prince Trion visited Al Zahbi once before, when the Emperor was yet hale and healthy.${prompt}
  8386: The incident that occurred is most likely connected to all this...${prompt}
  8387: ?${prompt}
  8388: However, now is not the time to be telling tales of the past.${prompt}
  8389: |-
    This matter has grown beyond the realm of our judgment.
    We must bring this letter to Prince Pieuje immediately.${prompt}
  8390: Prince Pieuje!${prompt}
  8391: What is all this commotion?${prompt}
  8392: |-
    How like Trion to rush off without so much as a word...
    He has earned a reputation for action before thought.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    Your Highness.
    This is the letter we believe to have been penned by your brother.${prompt}
  8394: Travialce may have provided enough keys to unlock this rambling script...${prompt}
  8395: This may require some time...${prompt}
  8396: |-
    Hmph. There is no need to convene a meeting of linguists, Halver.
    Let me see this letter.${prompt}
  8397: This time, my brother's actions may have a positive side...${prompt}
  8398: He writes on the current state of the Empire.${prompt}
  8399: We must turn our attention to the Near East, where a battle on the scale of the Crystal War is brewing...${prompt}
  8400: What on Vana'diel is happening over there...?${prompt}
  8401: |-
    There is an overwhelming reason for the beastman attacks on Al Zahbi.
    I will read to you what my brother has written, word for word.${prompt}
  8402: “At the center of this conflict is a treasure known as the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  8403: “This object emits an enchanting melody, unheard by mortal ears.${prompt}
  8404: “The melody envelops and fills those nearby with a boundless energy, be they person or beastman.${prompt}
  8405: “The citizens of Al Zahbi call this melody the Astral Wind.”${prompt}
  8406: I believe I have come to understand Prince Trion's apprehensions.${prompt}
  8407: You are not alone in that feeling.${prompt}
  8408: Then we are in agreement.${prompt}
  8409: Halver, have messengers sent to the other nations immediately.${prompt}
  8410: We must convene an emergency meeting of the nations.${prompt}
  8411: |-
    Understood, Your Highness.
    And the location?${prompt}
  8412: |-
    The location...
    Send a request to Jeuno to secure a meeting room in the Grand Duke Palace.${prompt}
  8413: At once.${prompt}
  8414: |-
    Prince Pieuje.
    What shall be done about Prince Trion's frequent excursions outside of the Kingdom?${prompt}
  8415: I do not wish to be rude, but we are well aware of how the prince reacts to attempts to dissuade him from his course...${prompt}
  8416: That is true.${prompt}
  8417: Having the heir to the throne playing at being a mercenary will not improve San d'Oria's image in the eyes of the world.${prompt}
  8418: |-
    But the solution is simple.
    I shall write my brother a letter.${prompt}
  8419: A letter, Your Highness?${prompt}
  8420: |-
    Yes.
    I have an idea.${prompt}
  8421: But I shall need a volunteer to deliver it safely to Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  8422: I suggest Travialce. He is well versed in the geography of the region.${prompt}
  8423: |-
    Excellent.
    Let it be done.${prompt}
  8424: I will not fail you, Your Highness.${prompt}
  8425: |-
    Your Highness, this is ${name-player}.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] brought Prince Trion's letter back from the Near East.${prompt}
  8426: |-
    Is that so?
    I do not approve of my brother's rash actions, but he does have an eye for trustworthy messengers.${prompt}
  8427: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I am sure you are exhausted from your long journey, but your presence will be required at the meeting in Jeuno.${prompt}
  8428: We may have need of your testimony.${prompt}
  8429: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Arrangements for the meeting will be made in all haste.${prompt}
  8430: Make your way to Jeuno as soon as your preparations are complete.${prompt}
  8431: I never thought the situation to be this grave...${prompt}
  8432: |-
    Well met, friend. I am Temple Knight Rembard.
    My duty is the issuance of marriage certificates to lawfully wedded couples.${prompt}
  8433: How may I serve you this day?${prompt}
  8434: |-
    Marriage certificates are legally binding documents issued in recognition of the matrimony of the two individuals named therein.
    They may also adorn the wall of your Mog House.${prompt}
  8435: Those wishing to receive this document must present proof of their marriage in the manner I shall now explain.${prompt}
  8436: |-
    The couple should form a party while the husband is equipped with his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}.
    Thence, speak to me, and I shall prepare the certificates without delay.${prompt}
  8437: 'Alternatively, should you have a ${color: 5}wedding ring${color: 1} in your possession, it is possible to request issuance without your partner present.${prompt}'
  8438: |-
    Please bear in the mind, though, that one person cannot possess multiple certificates at any given time.
    Furthermore, the nation of issuance for the certificate you hold cannot differ from that of your spouse.${prompt}
  8439: Lastly, the re-issuance of a misplaced certificate can be carried out solely by the officiating body wherefrom it was originally issued.${prompt}
  8440: A wedding is a joyous event wherein two souls brought together by fate are joined in an everlasting union.${prompt}
  8441: San d'Orian tradition holds that the bride and groom, each with weapon in hand, swear an oath of lifelong loyalty to each other before the goddess Altana.${prompt}
  8442: 'Wedding rings--a ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1} and a ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}, to be precise--are required.${prompt}'
  8443: These rings, which require rare and ofttimes elusive ingredients for synthesis, symbolize a couple's undying devotion to each other.${prompt}
  8444: 'Prior to presenting the ring to your partner, it is common practice to engrave one''s name onto it using such items as ${color: 5}cyclone crystals${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8445: '${color: 5}Wedding dresses${color: 1} and ${color: 5}benedight coats${color: 1} popularly serve as ceremonial attire for men and women, respectively.${prompt}'
  8446: |-
    While garments like in form and function can be synthesized, the procurement of ingredients to make them presents quite a challenge. It is precisely for this reason, however, that significance is lent to their donning in ceremonies.
    Some adventurers perform the synthesis themselves, while others prefer to entrust the task to a friend.${prompt}
  8447: |-
    Be not disheartened, though, should the garments be not within your means.
    No law dictates how couples must attire themselves in a wedding ceremony.${prompt}
  8448: Should you encounter difficulty obtaining any of the ceremonial items mentioned thus far, they can also be purchased from the chests you see before you.${prompt}
  8449: |-
    Such items as fireworks and ${color: 5}wedding bells${color: 1} are also available to assist you in enhancing the atmosphere of revelry.
    You may purchase them as you see fit.${prompt}
  8450: |-
    It seems you already have a marriage certificate in your possession.
    I am not authorized to issue you another.${prompt}
  8451: 'Your current job level must needs be level ${number: 2} or greater if you wish to be issued a marriage certificate.${prompt}'
  8452: You are not eligible to receive a marriage certificate.${prompt}
  8453: 'Legally wedded couples wishing to receive marriage certificates should form a party while the husband is equipped with his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}. Thence, speak to the official in charge, and the certificates shall be prepared for you without delay.${prompt}'
  8454: |-
    It appears you have previously been issued a marriage certificate by another nation.
    The re-issuance of a misplaced certificate can be carried out solely by the officiating body wherefrom it was originally issued.${prompt}
  8455: It appears your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.${prompt}
  8456: |-
    It appears your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.
    To obtain one of your own, you must request issuance from the same officiating body as your spouse.${prompt}
  8457: |-
    Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.
    Furthermore, the nation of issuance for the certificate you hold cannot differ from that of your partner's.${prompt}
  8458: Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.${prompt}
  8459: By the power vested in me by the Church of San d'Oria, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.${prompt}

    My companion and I are, um...simple adventurers hungry for knowledge.
    If my lord could spare the time, we wish to learn about the Battle of Xarcabard.${prompt}
  8475: Ah, your request is as music to my ears, young lady. The youth of today show precious little interest in the events of the past...the sacrifices that many made to ensure the continued existence of our fair Kingdom.${prompt}
  8476: |-
    Naught would give me greater pleasure than to share all I know.
    Now then, where shall we begin?${prompt}
  8477: Ah, yes. Sir Ragelise B Baloumat, the hero of the Battle of Xarcabard. 'Tis a name I recall well.${prompt}
  8478: Sadly, though, I am given to understand that none in his unit, the Ironcrest Hawks, survived to return home.${prompt}
  8479: Such a grueling battle it must have been...${prompt}
  8480: Wait. I once was told of a man who religiously visited Sir Ragelise's grave out in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  8481: '!!!${prompt}'
  8482: I've no notion as to the identity of that individual, but it might well serve to seek him out.${prompt}
  8483: Thank you, my lord!${prompt}
  8484: ${name-player}! Let's make haste to Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  8485: A moment.${prompt}
  8486: Yes, my lord.${prompt}
  8487: The resemblance you bear to someone I fought beside during the war is...truly striking. An endearing young lady she was, with such strength of spirit as would make one believe naught was beyond hope.${prompt}
  8488: |-
    'Tis merely but a trick of the mind, surely, for two decades have passed since then.
    Were we to meet this day, she would stand before me a stately matron.${prompt}
  8489: Press confirm to proceed.${prompt}
  8490: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  8491: Halt! You'd best have a good reason for skulking about Castle d'Oraguille, rabble!${prompt}
  8492: A letter? Hand that over this instant!${prompt}
  8493: |-
    I shall return in a moment.
    Wander not an ilm from where you stand!${prompt}
  8494: |-
    Monarlais Halver will see you.
    To the castle with you at once, and no detours!${prompt}
  8495: |-
    Well met, ${name-player}.
    How fare you these days?${prompt}
  8496: A letter? And this seal...${prompt}
  8497: |-
    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}
  8498: |-
    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}
  8499: An iron giant with the power to smite an airship from the sky, and a young Empress who would nonetheless seek to restore its power...${prompt}
  8500: '...${prompt}'
  8501: I would hear your counsel, Halver.${prompt}
  8502: Your Highness. I must confess, my heart misgives me as to the wisdom of this endeavor...${prompt}
  8503: Halver...!${prompt}
  8504: This is the selfsame Empire, after all, that not so long ago did wield the power of this colossus against this Kingdom and our allies.${prompt}
  8505: |-
    That said, they have since made amends, and we have accepted their formal apology.
    To hold past misdeeds against them now would be most...unchivalrous...of us, would it not?${prompt}
  8506: '...And yet the past cannot be so readily forgotten.${prompt}'
  8507: Begging your pardon, my prince. I daresay that the mere fact that they seek our consent--rather than engaging in devious and furtive plots--shows that we deal no longer with the Silent Empire of old.${prompt}
  8508: |-
    Settle yourself, Halver.
    I said nothing of denying their plea.${prompt}
  8509: Forgive me, my prince. I spoke in haste.${prompt}
  8510: It is precisely because I remember well the past that I believe the Empire's plea to be sincere.${prompt}
  8511: |-
    It is clear that this Empress Nashmeira truly intends to lead her nation to a new age.
    I have no doubt that she will prove a staunch ally worthy of our trust.${prompt}
  8512: Oho! Never did I think this day would come, but I must say...my brother has the right of it.${prompt}
  8513: Besides, were something to go amiss, the presence of ${name-player} here should suffice to keep matters in hand.${prompt}
  8514: I could not agree more, my king.${prompt}
  8515: ${name-player} has served the Kingdom with loyalty and valor time and again.${prompt}
  8516: I, too, can vouch for this, Father.${prompt}
  8517: I have fought by ${name-player}'s side, and you will find no comrade more honorable.${prompt}
  8518: The Kingdom is safe in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] hands, Father.${prompt}
  8519: Very well.${prompt}
  8520: |-
    Halver and my sons present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}
  8521: Besides, were something to go amiss, the presence of ${name-player} here should suffice to keep matters in hand.${prompt}
  8522: |-
    Halver and my son present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}
  8523: Greetings, ${name-player}. I must say, that outfit truly becomes you.${prompt}
  8524: Well met, adventurer. I must say, that outfit truly becomes you.${prompt}
  8525: You should know that your exploits have impressed many a knight, so much so that those have emerged who would forsake their Kingdom for an unfettered life. It troubles me to imagine a San d'Oria bereft of those who would charge into battle in her defense.${prompt}
  8526: But I digress. After all, is now not the time for celebration?${prompt}
  8527: |-
    I had prepared a letter to send to the moogles, but duties to the crown had not afforded me the time to have it dispatched.
    But if I might be forgiven for my impropriety, I would proffer it to you here and now.${prompt}
  8528: Ah, yes. I must depart for the Duchy to seek counsel regarding the knights...${prompt}
  8529: Yes? Have you business with me?${prompt}
  8530: |-
    Ah, 'tis you. When last we conversed, you were searching for a certain Crystal War veteran.
    Were you able to find who you sought?${prompt}
  8531: You were? That is pleasing news indeed. More pleasing still to know that you can turn to him again should the need arise.${prompt}
  8532: Hm? Your companion appears not to be with you today.${prompt}
  8533: '...Or have I confused you with another?${prompt}'
  8534: Pray forgive me. Keeping vigil here day after day, my mind is wont to wander on occasion.${prompt}
  8535: Were you able to find who you sought?${prompt}
  8536: Hail! I am Curilla V Mecru, general of the Temple Knights. Our order is charged with protecting Chateau d'Oraguille and the city itself from any forces that would seek to cause chaos inside our fair realm.${prompt}
  8537: 'Is this...${keyitem-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8538: Yes, it is true that I am a participant in this Trust magic experiment, but I do not recall forming any sort of bond with you.${prompt}
  8539: 'Perhaps it would behoove you to further serve ${choice: 5}[your homeland/San d''Oria] before coming to see me.${prompt}'
  8540: |-
    What do you wish today?
    Oh, you have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}? I see...${prompt}
  8541: So you have succeeded in drawing forth Trust magic, then.${prompt}
  8542: No, I cannot admit to being surprised. A ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your talents is capable of much in these dark times.${prompt}
  8543: Let me guess--you wish to see if you can summon my alter ego, do you not?${prompt}
  8544: |-
    Attempt the ritual with Curilla?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8545: I must confess, my heart is not in this, either. Prince Trion insisted that I participate, though, and I cannot deny him.${prompt}
  8546: Both Prince Trion and the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies had the same words for me when this experiment began.${prompt}
  8547: “Think of the glory, Curilla.” Yet to be honest, I am quite unsure of myself.${prompt}
  8548: I fear my skills are yet inferior. What good can an alter ego be when the original remains weak?${prompt}
  8549: Try as I might, I cannot help but picture people pointing and laughing as I falter. A leader who cannot command respect is no better than a king with no country.${prompt}
  8550: And further, I have never been one to fight for fame or personal gain. Not since I lost my eye in exchange for victory in the tourneys.${prompt}
  8551: I recall discussing this with you when I asked you to bring me water from the spring atop Horlais Peak.${prompt}
  8552: And further, fame and personal gain are worldly pleasures which I do not need.${prompt}
  8553: You proffer that I should think not of glory, but of...helping others?${prompt}
  8554: '...You are correct, of course. Yet another sign that I have much to learn.${prompt}'
  8555: Now that I think about it, my father, Rainemard, certainly taught you one of life's most valuable lessons.${prompt}
  8556: “A true warrior does not shirk from defeat.”${prompt}
  8557: You were there, right by my side. We rode to victory on a chariot fashioned from your courage.${prompt}
  8558: '${choice: 2}[Now that I think about it,/I''m also reminded of when] you brandished the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, working to better yourself and succeeding admirably.${prompt}'
  8559: I can still picture being reprimanded by Pieuje for being overzealous.${prompt}
  8560: But your success and knowing the extent of your determination certainly lessened the sting a palpable degree.${prompt}
  8561: 'You ${choice: 2}[/also ]gave your all in the Royal Family''s time of need.${prompt}'
  8562: I would ask of you yet one further favor to add to my many debts--please, continue to protect the people of San d'Oria. There is much here that only one of your caliber could recognize.${prompt}
  8563: You know what I would like most of all? To challenge you once more in valiant combat, like we did back in Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt}
  8564: You were a couple steps ahead of me then. I wonder how we would match up today.${prompt}
  8565: I will even forgive you for introducing that lovely woman to Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8566: Why would you need my forgiveness?${prompt}
  8567: W-wait! I-it is not what you think!${prompt}
  8568: |-
    ${choice: 4}[Anyway/A-anyway], let us return to the subject of Trust. I will consent to engaging in this ritual with you.
    Please, close your eyes...${prompt}
  8569: A grand success! Perhaps now I can repay my debt to you and the citizens of this great nation.${prompt}
  8570: May our paths cross again and our friendship deepen further.${prompt}
  8571: Who goes there?${prompt}
  8572: Ah, ${name-player}! I did not expect your presence this day.${prompt}
  8573: 'You need not say more. ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]} has found its way into your possession, has it not?${prompt}'
  8574: The natural conclusion, then, is that you desire that my alter ego accompany you into battle.${prompt}
  8575: I must admit the idea is not without merit.${prompt}
  8576: My responsibilities here at the chateau have kept me overlong from the front lines. How I long to remind San d'Oria's enemies to fear the name Trion I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  8577: Yet both needs may be served. While I tend to my duties here, my alter ego may mete out justice abroad. What say you? Will you have me as a companion in your crusades?${prompt}
  8578: |-
    Crusade with Prince Trion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let the lion of San d'Oria roar!
    Eh, go back to doing paperwork.${prompt}
  8579: Hahahaha, perhaps one day my penmanship will match my swordsmanship. Fair enough, ${name-player}, but return to me if ever your mind changes.${prompt}
  8580: Hahahaha, the Dragon King himself could not have said it better!${prompt}
  8581: Still, I would have you know I did not join this “Trust” initiative merely in the pursuit of personal glory.${prompt}
  8582: I am a son of the House d'Oraguille, and ever have the interests of San d'Oria and her citizens been foremost in my mind.${prompt}
  8583: But why should others throughout the rest of the world remain unguided? No, I must work to ensure that those of all upbringings are free from tyranny!${prompt}
  8584: Alas, attending affairs abroad means neglecting affairs of state...or so I thought. The institute's announcement has granted me a means to be in multiple places at once.${prompt}
  8585: However, there are those of my house who have balked at the suggestion.${prompt}
  8586: Though it was by the hands of adventurers that the Shadow Lord met his demise, it would be unseemly for one of royal lineage to be seen under the employ of one who spends weeks on end defecating in the woods.${prompt}
  8587: Thus, I have one stipulation to which you must assent before we proceed further.${prompt}
  8588: You are never to forget that when we fight together, the dawning sun gleaming before us, I am the one who is in command.${prompt}
  8589: That should silence those in opposition.${prompt}
  8590: And if they continue to howl, I shall remind them of how it was you who brought peace to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8591: Perhaps then they will recall the incident of the Lightbringer. Without your intervention, our house would doubtlessly have been more shamed than anything I could personally do.${prompt}
  8592: 'I must${choice: 2}[/ also] tell them in great detail about your activities in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}'
  8593: |-
    What I saw with these two eyes...
    No, I did not see for myself. I heard about your good work from a trusted source.${prompt}
  8594: '${choice: 2}[If that fails to sway them, I shall detail/Your exploits go further. I could never forget] the time when you lent the knights your aid in their quest to hunt down a traitor selling information to the Orcs.${prompt}'
  8595: That Vilbert would prey on a man whose mother was infirm...a swift death was too kind an end for him.${prompt}
  8596: |-
    This Trust magic...
    Is it true that it is based upon the bonds that tie us? If so, is it these kinds of emotions that make it stronger?${prompt}
  8597: |-
    ${choice: 2}[Should they not understand, I will have to try something else./But let us leave that aside.]
    I'm reminded of another time...${prompt}
  8598: A time when you brought a female adventurer here with you, claiming she would make a perfect queen.${prompt}
  8599: Should the ceremony succeed, do not even think of pulling a stunt like that with my alter ego.${prompt}
  8600: And should Curilla catch even one whiff of it...my fist will be covered in the blood of a certain meddling ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who shall remain nameless.${prompt}
  8601: '${choice: 2}[If they fail to understand, I shall mention how/And one other thing. I would be remiss to mention the time when] our paths crossed under more...antagonistic circumstances.${prompt}'
  8602: “Antagonistic” may be a bit extreme--but it does describe the feelings I harbored toward you when you bested me in the Stellar Fulcrum. 'Twas truly a match well fought.${prompt}
  8603: But enough reminiscing. Though our discussion has been a fruitful one, my country calls for me to serve.${prompt}
  8604: Let us engage in this ritual quickly, and pray for success.${prompt}
  8605: |-
    Allow me to congratulate us both on our efforts. What is impossible for one becomes merely a trifle for two.
    My alter ego will gladly accompany you in combat--just never forget who is in command.${prompt}
  8606: Ah, mais avez-vous encore quelque chose à discuter ?${prompt}
  8607: La jeune femme Lion ? Oui, elle était ici il n'y a pas si longtemps, la tête pleine de questions.${prompt}
  8608: Elle était plutôt insistante pour obtenir une audience avec le Prince Trion, délirant sur les formations de l'armée Orc et exigeant de parler aux Chevaliers Royaux.${prompt}
  8609: Une jeune femme présomptueuse, c'est certain. Et sans même une lettre d'invitation ! Pourtant, j'ai fait de mon mieux pour rester courtois en la repoussant.${prompt}
  8610: Mais cette lueur dans ses yeux n'était pas quelque chose que l'on croise tous les jours. Peut-être y avait-il un fond de vérité, ai-je pensé, et j'ai envoyé mes propres agents pour enquêter.${prompt}
  8611: Les mouvements Orc ont en effet été étranges dernièrement, et j'ai instruit les rangs de faire plus d'investigations.${prompt}
  8612: Je vous demanderais également de consulter les deux autres nations au sujet des mouvements des bêtes dans leurs territoires respectifs. Voici.${prompt}
  8613: Ceci est un parchemin spécial appelé un "chiffre". Ceux capables d'utiliser la magie de Confiance développée à Jeuno le trouveront une arme inestimable dans leur arsenal.${prompt}
  8614: '${choice: 2}[Je/Je comprends que le/Je comprends que le] l’Institut d’Études Magiques de Jeuno a dépêché du personnel bien versé dans cette nouvelle initiative à ${choice: 2}[San d’Oria Sud/Port Bastok/Bois de Windurst], donc je vous recommande de leur parler dès que possible.${prompt}'
  8615: Peut-être que mon alter ego peut vous être utile pendant que vous menez à bien cette mission.${prompt}
  8616: Hm ? On dirait que je vous ai demandé de capturer un fantôme avec rien d'autre qu'un sac en papier.${prompt}
  8617: '...Je dois admettre que le consulat de ${choice: 2}[Bastok/Windurst] a déposé une plainte formelle à mon sujet pour avoir émis des édits exigeants envers ceux qui ne sont pas encore prêts.${prompt}'
  8618: Mais s'il y avait du personnel plus capable autour, peut-être que je n'aurais pas à le faire.${prompt}
  8619: Laissez-moi vous donner quelque chose pour faire avancer la cause.
  8620: Oho ! C'est toujours un plaisir de vous voir, ${name-player}. Venez, il y a quelque chose que je dois vous donner.${prompt}
  8621: Ce parchemin contient une essence de mon être. Ceux qui participent à l'initiative de Confiance peuvent l'utiliser pour invoquer mon alter ego.${prompt}
  8622: 'L’Institut d’Études Magiques de Jeuno a dépêché du personnel bien versé dans le projet à ${choice: 2}[San d’Oria Sud/Port Bastok/Bois de Windurst]${choice: 2}[, /--ou du moins c’est ce que j’ai entendu--/--ou du moins c’est ce que j’ai entendu--] donc je vous recommande de leur parler dès que possible.${prompt}'
  8623: Pourquoi voyager seul quand vous pourriez m'avoir à vos côtés ? Hahaha !${prompt}
  8624: Salutations, ${name-player} ! J'ai une tâche importante qui pourrait bénéficier de l'œil aiguisé et des pieds rapides d'un aventurier !${prompt}
  8625: Bien le bonjour, ${name-player} ! J'ai une tâche importante qui pourrait bénéficier de votre œil aiguisé et de vos pieds rapides !${prompt}
  8626: Vous voyez, quelque chose de plutôt malheureux s'est produit l'autre jour...${prompt}
  8627: Vous m'avez invoqué, Votre Majesté ?${prompt}
  8628: Merci d'être venu, Halver. Il y a une affaire urgente dont je dois discuter avec vous. Ou peut-être serait-il plus précis de dire que j'ai une faveur à vous demander.${prompt}
  8629: Que vous tracasse-t-il donc ?${prompt}
  8630: Vous voyez, la Maison Virgaut organise une fête - un bal pour être plus précis - le premier depuis longtemps.${prompt}
  8631: Peut-être avez-vous déjà entendu la nouvelle...${prompt}
  8632: Mais oui, bien sûr ! C'est le sujet de conversation de la ville ! Leur famille a une histoire plutôt longue et riche.${prompt}
  8633: Quand j'étais encore qu'un modeste étudiant, les bals organisés par la Maison Virgaut étaient légendaires.${prompt}
  8634: Le manoir était rempli de belles jeunes dames, parées de différentes teintes et parures... Je rêve encore de leurs fêtes à ce jour.${prompt}
  8635: Là-bas, j'ai rencontré une belle femme, sans savoir à l'époque que nos destins étaient liés par la destinée. Oui, c'étaient des temps excitants...${prompt}
  8636: Encore une fois, Halver. Je ne t'ai pas invoqué ici pour partager des histoires de ta jeunesse.${prompt}
  8637: Ah ! Pardonnez-moi, Votre Majesté ! Oui, que vouliez-vous dire à propos du prochain bal ?${prompt}
  8638: Je souhaite vous parler de Trion, qui a également reçu une invitation.${prompt}
  8639: Le même Prince Trion qui fuit dès qu'on mentionne le mot bal !?${prompt}
  8640: Oui, exactement. Il trouve que les arts de la diplomatie et de la socialisation lors d'un bal l'ennuient à mourir.${prompt}
  8641: Maintenant que vous en parlez, je me souviens qu'il a quitté le dernier bal dès qu'il a appris que les Orcs prévoyaient d'attaquer le Château d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  8642: J'ai appris par la suite que c'était un plan hâtif qui aurait facilement pu être contrecarré par les Chevaliers Royaux seuls.${prompt}
  8643: Et la fois précédente, il est mystérieusement tombé malade dès son arrivée au manoir de la Maison Virgaut.${prompt}
  8644: En effet, je me suis toujours demandé à propos du timing de cela moi-même.${prompt}
  8645: Avez-vous oublié ? Une fois qu'il a quitté la maison, il semblait être en parfaite condition physique, monté sur son chocobo.${prompt}
  8646: Oui, je suppose qu'il l'était... Cependant, le but de ce prochain bal est quelque peu différent qu'auparavant.${prompt}
  8647: Un grand nombre de dignitaires étrangers ont été invités. En tant que prince du Royaume de San d'Oria, sa présence est nécessaire pour transmettre une impression de dignité et d'autorité.${prompt}
  8648: C'est pourquoi j'ai convoqué Trion et ordonné qu'il représente dignement notre royaume à ce bal.${prompt}
  8649: Cependant, le fait demeure qu'il déteste danser de toutes les fibres de son être. C'est pourquoi je fais appel à vous, Halver.${prompt}
  8650: <Soupir> Vous demandez l'impossible, Votre Majesté.${prompt}
  8651: J'ai bien peur qu'il soit déjà assez difficile de convaincre le Prince Trion de profiter du bal, encore moins de corriger tout ce qui ne va pas dans sa "technique", pour le dire gentiment.${prompt}
  8652: De quoi parlez-vous ? Je veux simplement que vous preniez les précautions nécessaires pour toutes les éventualités qui pourraient survenir.${prompt}
  8653: Des éventualités ?${prompt}
  8654: Ah ! Je sais exactement quoi faire ! En fait, je serais prêt à parier ma vie là-dessus !${prompt}
  8655: Voici ce que j'ai en tête...${prompt}
  8656: Afin de garantir que le Prince Trion assiste au bal, nous devons empêcher tout incident imprévu qui pourrait lui donner une excuse pour partir.${prompt}
  8657: Par conséquent, nous devrons mettre fin à tout incident comme ce qui s'est passé avec les Orcs la dernière fois, avant qu'ils ne se produisent.${prompt}
  8658: À cette fin, j'ai demandé à Rahal, le leader des Chevaliers Royaux, des informations sur l'activité Orc dans la région.${prompt}
  8659: Il m'a demandé de lui envoyer un aventurier expérimenté pour l'aider dans ses efforts.${prompt}
  8660: Naturellement, j'ai pensé à vous en premier. Alors, seriez-vous disposé à nous aider ?${prompt}
  8661: Si vous pensez avoir ce qu'il faut pour aider Rahal, seriez-vous prêt à nous assister dans cette affaire ?${prompt}
  8662: |-
    Offer your assistance?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    Forget it.${prompt}
  8663: You have our gratitude. Now then, please visit Rahal and he will fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  8664: I see... I cannot force you to accept this task, but please come back if you are able to assist us.${prompt}
  8665: In addition to attending balls, Prince Trion also finds concerts and plays to be rather tedious.${prompt}
  8666: Therefore, we can take nothing for granted if we wish for him to carry out his princely duties.${prompt}
  8667: When you are ready, please visit Rahal in the Royal Knights' Quarters for further instructions.${prompt}
  8668: Ah, you must be ${name-player}, the adventurer Monarlais Halver spoke of.${prompt}
  8669: Yes, I imagine you shall do quite nicely.${prompt}
  8670: According to our mutual friend, you are worried about Orc activity in the area?${prompt}
  8671: Or perhaps more aptly put--you are worried about Prince Trion's response to any possible Orc movements in the area?${prompt}
  8672: If you respect Prince Trion's feelings, you would do best to refrain from assisting Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  8673: Although, I cannot understand why the good prince loathes attending balls so much.${prompt}
  8674: I am actually quite an accomplished dancer myself.${prompt}
  8675: Well, enough of that for now.${prompt}
  8676: First things first, we need to investigate any potential Orc threats before they can divert the prince's attention.${prompt}
  8677: I sent scouts to both the Orc strongholds of Davoi and the Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt}
  8678: I have already dispatched another adventurer to the Ghelsba Outpost, so I want you to head for Davoi.${prompt}
  8679: Once there, you will need to meet up with our undercover agent, Quemaricond, and receive his report on the situation.${prompt}
  8680: This way, we'll be able to launch a preemptive strike if we find out that the Orcs are up to no good.${prompt}
  8681: Go to the Orc fortress of Davoi and speak with our scout Quemaricond to find out what he knows.${prompt}
  8682: The Royal Knights must strike at the Orcs before their actions can attract Prince Trion's attention.${prompt}
  8683: In addition to attending balls, Prince Trion also finds concerts and plays to be rather tedious.${prompt}
  8684: Therefore, we can take nothing for granted if we wish for him to carry out his princely duties.${prompt}
  8685: Hmm... It seems the rumors that Curilla spoke of were true...${prompt}
  8686: Forgive me. I recently heard rather disturbing news.${prompt}
  8687: So how did it go? From the looks of it, you completed my request without incident.${prompt}
  8688: What's this!?
  8689: So the Orcs were sending messengers to the Northlands?${prompt}
  8690: Although we do not know the details, it is safe to say this is no ordinary “egg” that we are talking about.${prompt}
  8691: If at all possible, we should try to make the first move and find a way to disrupt their fiendish plan.${prompt}
  8692: Naturally, if it comes to sending troops to the Northlands, we will have to take our fellow alliance members into consideration.${prompt}
  8693: At any rate, we must first look to secure the path to the Northlands by shoring up our defenses at Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8694: We have received reports of a mysterious monster roaming the area...${prompt}
  8695: I shall see that word of this matter gets to Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  8696: However, I have a feeling it will do little to allay his fears--quite the opposite in fact.${prompt}
  8697: If Prince Trion learns of this, he will surely consider it necessary to march on the Northlands and begin making preparations for war.${prompt}
  8698: I can foresee all kinds of potential problems. We must approach this situation with the utmost caution.${prompt}
  8699: It is much too soon to consider dispatching the Royal Knights to the Northlands. Perhaps we ought to call upon Excenmille?${prompt}
  8700: I see you dealt with Rahal's request regarding the ball held by House Virgaut. You have my gratitude.${prompt}
  8701: Although, I wish you had better news. The Orcs couldn't have picked a worse time to stir things up.${prompt}
  8702: Well, it cannot be helped now. I shall leave the Orcs to Rahal. We will take whatever steps are necessary.${prompt}
  8703: Hm? What steps might those be, you ask?${prompt}
  8704: Well, when Prince Trion felt ill immediately upon arriving at House Virgaut...${prompt}
  8705: No white magic, potion, or prayer could alleviate what ailed him. At first, we thought it to be some sort of curse, but we were mistaken.${prompt}
  8706: What's that? You think he was faking the whole thing?${prompt}
  8707: How dare you besmirch the prince's good name! You can be jailed in Bostaunieux Oubliette for 100 years for slandering the royal family like that!${prompt}
  8708: Of course, I suspected the same thing myself at first...${prompt}
  8709: At any rate, if we can prepare some medicine in case Prince Trion falls ill again, we should be able to get through this.${prompt}
  8710: That is why I have requested the help of the gardener Chalvatot, who is well-versed in herbs and other remedies.${prompt}
  8711: I imagine his research ought to be done by now. Please go and see what he has to say.${prompt}
  8712: You should be able to find him in Queen Leaute's gardens at this hour.${prompt}
  8713: I wish to prepare some potent medicine in case Prince Trion should suddenly fall ill again.${prompt}
  8714: To that end, I asked the gardener Chalvatot to look into the matter, given his familiarity with herbs. Please go speak with him in Queen Leaute's gardens.${prompt}
  8715: Now then, Princess. I have selected some flowers to use in your hairpin for the ball.${prompt}
  8716: Thank you, Chalvatot. I always have trouble deciding on such things.${prompt}
  8717: This is a very important matter--everyone will be watching your dance with Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8718: I am sure that Queen Leaute will be watching over you as well.${prompt}
  8719: This won't take too long.${prompt}
  8720: Ah, that reminds me. I am curious what you may have heard, Chalvatot.${prompt}
  8721: People are saying that even Curilla has prepared a dress for this ball. I suppose stranger things have happened, but...${prompt}
  8722: <Sigh> I have only heard mere rumors.${prompt}
  8723: And what rumors are those?${prompt}
  8724: Maybe you already know... The ball is a social event for...ladies and gentlemen to attend. How can I put this delicately...${prompt}
  8725: Yes, I already know that. It is a place to meet potential romantic partners.${prompt}
  8726: Yes, indeed. So rumor has it that Count Teulomme's heir and Lady Curilla...${prompt}
  8727: You cannot be serious!
  8728: Ah, please excuse me for a moment.${prompt}
  8729: What can I do for you?${prompt}
  8730: I see... So you wish to prepare some medicine for my brother at the ball...${prompt}
  8731: Princess, please do not converse with this rabble. Leave the matter to me; I shall handle it for you.${prompt}
  8732: Princess, please leave this to me.${prompt}
  8733: I already know something of this matter--a remedy for when Prince Trion is not feeling well...${prompt}
  8734: Please wait a moment, Chalvatot.${prompt}
  8735: But I...${prompt}
  8736: 'Can I ask you to find a flower known as ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for me? It is necessary to make the medicine you seek.${prompt}'
  8737: It is quite rare, so I hear it only blooms in somewhat remote locations. People say that finding one is no easy task.${prompt}
  8738: However, I must move quickly in order to help my dear brother.${prompt}
  8739: 'Chalvatot, please tell ${choice: 1}[her/him] where ${keyitem-plural: 2[2]} tend to grow.${prompt}'
  8740: <Sigh> I suppose as an adventurer, you should have no problem with this task. Head to Attohwa Chasm in Mindartia.${prompt}
  8741: Thank you.${prompt}
  8742: I am counting on you, ${name-player}. Please take care on your journey.${prompt}
  8743: I am counting on you, adventurer. Please take care on your journey.${prompt}
  8744: 'You should hurry. The princess needs you to find that ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} as soon as possible.${prompt}'
  8745: You can find them in the Attohwa Chasm. I've seen them growing near the rift in the earth.${prompt}
  8746: Don't be acting all high and mighty just because the princess treated you with respect.${prompt}
  8747: Duke Gaetan of House Teulomme...${prompt}
  8748: Hmm... I wonder if my father would be pleased...${prompt}
  8749: I see you've finally decided to grace us with your presence! How dare you keep the princess waiting!${prompt}
  8750: That was rather rude, Chalvatot.
  8751: This adventurer kindly agreed to help me with my request.${prompt}
  8752: Isn't that right?${prompt}
  8753: 'Thank you for bringing me the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  8754: You see... What I am about to tell you is a San d'Orian royal family secret.${prompt}
  8755: However, I feel comfortable telling you because I require your assistance with a certain matter. Can I swear you to secrecy?${prompt}
  8756: I must apologize for this, but I had some people look into your background.${prompt}
  8757: What I am about to tell you is a San d'Orian royal family secret.${prompt}
  8758: However, I feel comfortable telling you because I require your assistance with a certain matter. Can I swear you to secrecy?${prompt}
  8759: P-Princess!?
  8760: |-
    Will you keep it a secret?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    I can't.${prompt}
  8761: H-how dare you! You do not have a choice in the matter!${prompt}
  8762: Chalvatot, please be quiet...${prompt}
  8763: I appreciate your discretion.${prompt}
  8764: 'The truth is, the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} is not for my brother.${prompt}'
  8765: In fact, it is the very thing that caused him to fall ill in the first place.${prompt}
  8766: '...'
  8767: There was once a young woman who wore this flower in her hair upon visiting House Virgaut.${prompt}
  8768: My brother took ill soon after meeting this woman.${prompt}
  8769: My brother, who hates attending balls as a matter of course, saw this as an opportunity to get out of his duties.${prompt}
  8770: That is the truth behind what Monarlais Halver was talking about.${prompt}
  8771: Chalvatot looked into the matter, and it apparently has something to do with our particular body composition.${prompt}
  8772: Yes, I believe it is known as an allegorical reaction. Or maybe it was an allergen reaction...${prompt}
  8773: It is quite the mystery. Aside from my brother and me, nobody else is adversely affected by this flower.${prompt}
  8774: Yes, it affects me as well. Just like it does my brother-- Ungh...
  8775: Ahh!
  8776: P-Princess!
  8777: Hang in there! I shall bring you some peppermint at once!${prompt}
  8778: I... I'm fine, Chalvatot...
  8779: I am sorry to have worried you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8780: I am sorry to have worried you, adventurer.${prompt}
  8781: The peppermint that grows in the garden here is capable of counteracting the strange effect the flower has on our bodies.${prompt}
  8782: However, very few people know about this, not even Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  8783: Could I ask that you leave this particular matter out when you report back to him?${prompt}
  8784: Yes, simply tell him that you have prepared some medicine for Prince Trion and that he has nothing to worry about.${prompt}
  8785: We grow the peppermint here in the garden...${prompt}
  8786: 'We now have this rare ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} here thanks to you.${prompt}'
  8787: It will not grow back or fall into someone else's hands for a little while at least.${prompt}
  8788: I shall dispose of the flowers, so I am counting on you to handle the rest.${prompt}
  8789: 'I was not expecting the princess to take the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to her chambers...${prompt}'
  8790: I know her reasons, so I shall remain silent regarding the matter, even though it pains me greatly.${prompt}
  8791: Well? Did you speak with Chalvatot the gardener?${prompt}
  8792: Is that so!? You managed to prepare the medicine!?${prompt}
  8793: This is excellent news. House Virgaut's ball is coming up soon; I shall sleep much more soundly at night.${prompt}
  8794: Although, there is still one problem remaining...${prompt}
  8795: I have to decide on a possible replacement for Prince Trion's dance partner, Princess Claidie...${prompt}
  8796: If Princess Claidie is not feeling well, she would usually be replaced by Curilla.${prompt}
  8797: You see, what Prince Trion does cannot really be called dancing, so we require a skilled individual that is able to keep up with him.${prompt}
  8798: However, Curilla will be sharing a first dance with the heir to House Teulomme at this ball.${prompt}
  8799: Sharing a first dance... Or to put it in simpler terms, a way to check their romantic compatibility...${prompt}
  8800: The people of Chateau d'Oraguille can't stop talking about it. They say it's only a matter of time before General Curilla of the Temple Knights becomes Marquess Curilla instead.${prompt}
  8801: To be honest, I think my younger sister is a better match for him...${prompt}
  8802: A-ahem. Let us return to talking about the ball, shall we?${prompt}
  8803: I am having trouble thinking of any other possible replacements for Princess Claidie aside from Curilla.${prompt}
  8804: Therefore, it is imperative that Princess Claidie be healthy enough to attend the ball...${prompt}
  8805: Naturally, I wish for her to be in good health at other times too.${prompt}
  8806: Please remember to pray for her as well.${prompt}
  8807: About the ball... If Princess Claidie is physically unable to attend, Curilla would usually step in as her replacement.${prompt}
  8808: However, Curilla is already spoken for this time... What are we going to do?${prompt}
  8809: I am glad to see you, ${name-player}. I am afraid that a rather unfortunate incident has occurred.${prompt}
  8810: I found Princess Claidie collapsed on the floor!${prompt}
  8811: Although she does not appear to be suffering from a fever, she did not have the strength to stand.${prompt}
  8812: We have had both a doctor and a friar examine her, but the cause of her affliction remains a mystery.${prompt}
  8813: The king said she was simply tired and that we should not worry, but still...${prompt}
  8814: Who will be Prince Trion's dance partner now!?${prompt}
  8815: There is no need to get yourself all worked up, Halver.
  8816: Ah, forgive me, Prince Trion.${prompt}
  8817: I am sorry that all your work behind the scenes for this ball has been for naught.${prompt}
  8818: One can still socialize at the ball without dancing, you know. My father can be stuck in his ways sometimes.${prompt}
  8819: With all due respect, Prince Trion, I believe you are downplaying the significance of a dance.${prompt}
  8820: Dancing is a form of nonverbal communication; you press forward on your partner at times, but must also meet them halfway at others.${prompt}
  8821: That is why I am not so fond of it...${prompt}
  8822: Still, I have not given up yet.${prompt}
  8823: I simply need to find a replacement for Princess Claidie!${prompt}
  8824: I heard that Claidie's usual replacement, Curilla, declined because she is too busy?${prompt}
  8825: Hm? No, Curilla is not busy.${prompt}
  8826: She was asked to have the first dance by Lord Gaetan, heir to House Teulomme.${prompt}
  8827: What did you just say?${prompt}
  8828: I imagine some difficulties may arise due to their difference in status, but Curilla would make a fine countess.${prompt}
  8829: In fact, it is quite possible that she ends up being the one keeping Lord Gaetan in check.${prompt}
  8830: Would you not agree, Prince Trion?${prompt}
  8831: '...${prompt}'
  8832: Huh? W-wait, Prince Trion!${prompt}
  8833: What is it!?${prompt}
  8834: That reminds me... We could always ask my younger sister!${prompt}
  8835: Y-your what!?${prompt}
  8836: She would be the perfect replacement! She is a skilled dancer, and unlike me, she is actually quite fetching!${prompt}
  8837: Although, as the captain of the Carmine Swallows, she is usually rather busy...${prompt}
  8838: Your sister? I refuse!${prompt}
  8839: I am being completely serious...${prompt}
  8840: He actually sounded quite angry with me.${prompt}
  8841: Did he really have to be so forceful with his rejection?${prompt}
  8842: At any rate, I doubt anyone will be able to come up with a better idea.${prompt}
  8843: There is nobody other than my sister Altennia that can take Princess Claidie's place.${prompt}
  8844: Unfortunately, my sister's unit is currently away from the kingdom in order to hunt down a monster that appeared at Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8845: Wait, I know... I can just have you take this letter to Altennia and summon her to the capital.${prompt}
  8846: This goes without saying, but you do not have a choice in the matter. You must leave for Ranguemont Pass at once.${prompt}
  8847: No matter what anyone says, my sister Altennia is the only choice to replace Princess Claidie.${prompt}
  8848: You must go to Ranguemont Pass and find my sister so you can give her my letter.${prompt}
  8849: Even though she is on an important mission, I know she will do whatever her brother asks.${prompt}
  8850: Lord Gaetan of House Teulomme...${prompt}
  8851: What is there to think about...${prompt}
  8852: Hm? You wish to speak to me about Lord Gaetan of House Teulomme?${prompt}
  8853: This is a private matter; please stay out of it.${prompt}
  8854: Well, what did my sister say? Wait, why isn't she with you?${prompt}
  8855: Wh-what did you say!?${prompt}
  8856: I cannot believe that my adorable sister would turn her back on her own brother like this!${prompt}
  8857: No, this is no time for me to be crying.${prompt}
  8858: Now that I think about it, my dear sister is right.${prompt}
  8859: If we can convince Prince Trion that he wants to dance with Curilla and no one else, all of our problems will be solved.${prompt}
  8860: Of course, we are doing this for the prince's own good.${prompt}
  8861: It should be Lord Gaetan of House Teulomme that is crying, not me.${prompt}
  8862: I am counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8863: I shall speak with him, so please head to Prince Trion's room once you are ready.${prompt}
  8864: There is no need for concern. In private Prince Trion is a gentle soul, quite different from the stern face he presents to the world.${prompt}
  8865: It is imperative that we secure the cooperation of Lady Curilla if Prince Trion is to dance at this ball.${prompt}
  8866: Your job is to speak with Prince Trion and convince him to say that he refuses to dance with anybody but Lady Curilla.${prompt}
  8867: You will need to speak to him in his quarters. Do not worry though, the prince is a gentle soul in private.${prompt}
  8868: Come in.${prompt}
  8869: Ah, ${name-player}... I know why you are here.${prompt}
  8870: Although, I do not exactly understand what Halver means.${prompt}
  8871: So basically, you are here to change my mind about this matter?${prompt}
  8872: In that case, how about you do so via a test of strength!${prompt}
  8873: |-
    How will you convince Trion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Talk about Claidie.
    Talk about dancing.
    Talk about Curilla.${prompt}
  8874: Hmph. You are concerned about Claidie too, hm?${prompt}
  8875: I would like to say there is nothing to worry about, but I feel helpless since all I can do is pray for her.${prompt}
  8876: However, I do find her mysterious illness to be somewhat peculiar. That unusual flower... No, it couldn't be.${prompt}
  8877: Haha! Dancing, the unspoken language! It lets you float like a butterfly yet sting like a bee!${prompt}
  8878: I would be happy to dance with you, although you might not make it out in one piece.${prompt}
  8879: Hmph. What about Curilla?${prompt}
  8880: |-
    She will be dancing with Lord Gaetan, right?
    Hahaha! That should be a sight to see.${prompt}
  8881: |-
    How will you convince him?
    ${selection-lines}
    Talk about Altennia.
    Talk about the egg.
    Talk about Gaetan M. Teulomme.${prompt}
  8882: Halver's younger sister? His sense of humor leaves much to be desired, but she is an accomplished knight.${prompt}
  8883: She often makes jokes, but it is due to her past experiences. Knights like her should be treasured.${prompt}
  8884: 'What are you talking about? Do you mean like ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8885: Oh, that is not what you meant? Is it some kind of secret?${prompt}
  8886: Well, somebody must know something... Rahal, maybe?${prompt}
  8887: Yes, definitely Rahal! I shall summon him as soon as we are finished talking.${prompt}
  8888: He is Curilla's dance partner, right?${prompt}
  8889: It is just as you say. I have also heard that he is not a very friendly person.${prompt}
  8890: He has performed many deeds that call his character into question, and my people report that he has a rather dour personality.${prompt}
  8891: D-don't get me wrong! I did not have him investigated or anything!${prompt}
  8892: It's not like I was asking about him, I just happened to overhear people's conversations!${prompt}
  8893: |-
    How will you convince him?
    ${selection-lines}
    Do you want to see Halver cry?
    What happened to Pieuje?
    Don't you want to dance with Curilla?${prompt}
  8894: I do not care.${prompt}
  8895: Although, that fool was already crying when I saw him. His sister must have been mean to him again.${prompt}
  8896: Speaking of sisters, this would all be resolved if my sister Claidie manages to recover, right?${prompt}
  8897: The symptoms of her mysterious illness should be treatable with peppermint, but surely they've already tried that...${prompt}
  8898: I am tired of Pieuje's constant nagging!${prompt}
  8899: He kept pestering me to look into this or that regarding Lord Gaetan!${prompt}
  8900: And every time he finishes his long-winded speeches, he always whispers the following...${prompt}
  8901: “Wouldn't it be chivalrous to save a woman from marrying such a man?”${prompt}
  8902: If I can save her as a knight, I will...but her intentions are... Wait, that's enough of this talk!${prompt}
  8903: Hm? Curilla?${prompt}
  8904: Naturally, it's not like I don't want to dance with her.${prompt}
  8905: Since I am unable to dance with Claidie, Curilla is the only one left who can keep up with me. I can say that for certain.${prompt}
  8906: I approach everything I do straight on and with the utmost effort. She is the only one who can match me.${prompt}
  8907: Although, have you heard why she hides her left eye?${prompt}
  8908: I see... In that case, I will spare you the details.${prompt}
  8909: However, it is true that I am directly involved with the matter.${prompt}
  8910: That is as much proof as anything that she is on my level... No, she is beyond me.${prompt}
  8911: She is ashamed, saying that it was the result of her seeking glory, but I don't believe that's the case.${prompt}
  8912: I only won because she jumped straight at me, without a moment's hesitation. It is proof of her bravery.${prompt}
  8913: And the fact that I was surprised by and feared that bravery is proof of my own weakness.${prompt}
  8914: I have devoted myself to my training ever since then so that I can surpass her one day.${prompt}
  8915: However, I am still unsure whether my sword, mind, and body are up to her level.${prompt}
  8916: Wait! We were supposed to be talking about dancing!${prompt}
  8917: At any rate, this needs to start with what Curilla herself feels...${prompt}
  8918: |-
    What will you ask him?
    ${selection-lines}
    How do you feel about it?${prompt}
  8919: Hmph! What do you mean, how do I feel?${prompt}
  8920: It's useless to talk about this any further!${prompt}
  8921: If you are going to get me to change my mind...${prompt}
  8922: Then the only way to do it will be through a clash of our blades, fists, and feelings!${prompt}
  8923: Meet me at the Bostaunieux Oubliette!${prompt}
  8924: That is where...
  8925: The two of us shall settle this matter! It shall be a battle to the death!${prompt}
  8926: Trion has already left for the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  8927: What's that? Your conversation with Prince Trion has been moved from his quarters to the Bostaunieux Oubliette?${prompt}
  8928: I feel sorry for your predicament, but we have no other choice. I guess I better recruit a more eloquent adventurer next time...${prompt}
  8929: Prince Trion ventured into the prison for some reason. He looked like he was ready to kill someone...${prompt}
  8930: It seems that Trion has gone to meet with Curilla.${prompt}
  8931: You were summoned to the Bostaunieux Oubliette by Prince Trion!?${prompt}
  8932: The fact that you are here unharmed must mean that your mission was a success!${prompt}
  8933: So, did Prince Trion say he wants to dance with Curilla!? Come on, spit it out already!${prompt}
  8934: Ah, it's you, adventurer. I was about to begin training today when Prince Trion came and told me something rather startling.${prompt}
  8935: Apparently, he knew of my plans to dance with Lord Gaetan at Count Virgaut's ball, and said that it would not be necessary.${prompt}
  8936: '...${prompt}'
  8937: So you must be the adventurer known as ${name-player} that he was talking about.${prompt}
  8938: I have something for you, along with a message.${prompt}
  8939: Monarlais Halver tells me that Prince Trion will be speaking to me directly about us dancing together...${prompt}
  8940: And this is something I received from His Highness.${prompt}
  8941: D-does this mean...${prompt}
  8942: Wait a moment. That means you are responsible for bringing Prince Trion to me...${prompt}
  8943: I cannot thank you enough!${prompt}
  8944: This is what I received from Prince Trion. Please take it.${prompt}
  8945: Lord Gaetan is the heir to House Teulomme, so this may lead to some trouble.${prompt}
  8946: However, Prince Trion said there was nothing to be afraid of.${prompt}
  8947: The thing I should fear most is Prince Trion's dancing. He's the first to admit it, so I can only imagine what to expect.${prompt}
  8948: Well done, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8949: I see the ball at House Virgaut was a rousing success.${prompt}
  8950: Everyone was quite astonished by Prince Trion's performance. Indeed, he exceeded all expectations.${prompt}
  8951: Furthermore, I also received my fair share of praise from King Destin.${prompt}
  8952: So once again, I appreciate your efforts regarding this matter. Although, there is one more thing...${prompt}
  8953: Prince Trion is requesting your presence. Please accompany me to his chambers.${prompt}
  8954: Ah! There you are, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8955: Heh. I see the orchestrator behind these events has finally decided to grace us with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] presence.${prompt}
  8956: We were just hearing about our brother's performance at the ball the other day.${prompt}
  8957: Our esteemed brother had little to do with it; Curilla deserves most of the credit.${prompt}
  8958: She glided across the dance floor, radiating elegance as her sun-kissed hair caught the eye of those in attendance.${prompt}
  8959: With each sweeping turn, quiet voices of admiration rose within the crowd.${prompt}
  8960: The beauty and grace of her movements resembled a large wreath of roses in full bloom.${prompt}
  8961: It was an enchanted affair, with those in attendance feeling as if they were in a vivid, waking dream...${prompt}
  8962: You have quite a way with words, dear brother.${prompt}
  8963: I imagine Curilla was merely holding on for dear life, as if she were riding a wild bull.${prompt}
  8964: Strange metaphors aside, I think the two of you are the perfect match.${prompt}
  8965: What!?
  8966: Perhaps it is time for me to serve as Curilla's standby instead...${prompt}
  8967: Hey! Let us not rush to rash decisions now!${prompt}
  8968: Come now, Brother.${prompt}
  8969: You stole Curilla away from Lord Gaetan. It is your duty as a knight to accept responsibility for such an action.${prompt}
  8970: Yes, I suppose you are right, but...${prompt}
  8971: I am glad that my brother was finally able to admit his true feelings.${prompt}
  8972: Honestly, I was worried that he might not ever realize how he felt about her.${prompt}
  8973: I imagine you must have realized the truth about me as well.${prompt}
  8974: Thanks to you, I was able to use my illness exactly as I intended.${prompt}
  8975: |-
    Who could this be!?
    Enter, and be quick about it!${prompt}
  8976: What is it now? We are not finished talking here...
  8977: Prince Trion, I bring important news!${prompt}
  8978: What is the matter!?
  8979: We have received an urgent message from the unit that was dispatched to the Northlands!${prompt}
  8980: Captain Rahal is waiting for you in the Royal Knights' Quarters!${prompt}
  8981: I shall go at once!${prompt}
  8982: Things were going perfectly, and now there is talk of the Northlands?${prompt}
  8983: What are you up to, Brother!?${prompt}
  8984: I wonder what this is about...${prompt}
  8985: ${name-player}, I would like to ask for your assistance once again...${prompt}
  8986: Please help my dear brother.${prompt}
  8987: Trion has already left for the Royal Knights' Quarters.${prompt}
  8988: The castle is buzzing with activity. I wonder what happened...${prompt}
  8989: It is too soon for rumors of Prince Trion and Curilla's dance to be spreading...${prompt}
  8990: |-
    They are both young, so their feelings may falter from even the slightest complication.
    It is important to protect this relationship while it is still in its infancy.${prompt}
  8991: Leave me be. I do not have time for you now...${prompt}
  8992: Ah, it's you. I heard about what happened with Altennia.${prompt}
  8993: You helped her take down the monster at Ranguemont Pass without any concern for your own safety.${prompt}
  8994: I believe she spoke with you about information regarding a certain “egg,” yes?${prompt}
  8995: |-
    Did you speak with her?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I did.
    No, sorry.
    Who's Altennia?${prompt}
  8996: She had no idea that the information about the “egg” was linked to the report you received from Quemaricond.${prompt}
  8997: Are you sure? She was planning to speak with you regarding the matter.${prompt}
  8998: Apparently, she didn't know that the information about the “egg” was linked to the report you received from Quemaricond.${prompt}
  8999: She is Lord Halver's younger sister. Decisive and quick to action, she excels at tracking down unusual enemies.${prompt}
  9000: Anyway, she didn't know that you were the first person to bring word of this “egg” to us.${prompt}
  9001: |-
    I already spoke with Prince Trion in regards to the matter after he returned from the ball.
    Just as a proper investigation was about to be launched...${prompt}
  9002: You are in even worse shape than I thought... Tell me about what happened at the Beaucedine Glacier, Rahal.${prompt}
  9003: Yes, my prince!
  9004: Based on the “egg” that I recently reported the Orcs are searching for, and an analysis of the map I obtained...${prompt}
  9005: Altennia and the Carmine Swallows headed north, but were attacked by someone...${prompt}
  9006: I am asking you who that “someone” is, Rahal.${prompt}
  9007: We have yet to ascertain that information, but we believe it to be an Orc...${prompt}
  9008: Please allow me to explain.${prompt}
  9009: |-
    Prince Trion.
    Excenmille M Aurchiat, at your service.${prompt}
  9010: Welcome, Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  9011: After receiving word from Rahal, I immediately reached out to a friend who still resides in Rhazowa.${prompt}
  9012: |-
    I was able to learn the identity of the messenger who is in frequent contact with the Orcs in Davoi.
    It sheds some light on the clandestine activities of a certain division.${prompt}
  9013: At the same time, I received news that several ships crossed the Nosteau Ocean from Rhazowa on their way to northern Quon.${prompt}
  9014: Upon analysis of that information, I found that the 3rd Silver Owl Brigade's strike unit, led by Slackjawed Mukdrom, was sent to the Northlands.${prompt}
  9015: Mukdrom...${prompt}
  9016: We have faced him numerous times throughout Rhazowa. His unit is a vile bunch who rather enjoy sheer brutality.${prompt}
  9017: Do you mean to say that Altennia's unit encountered this Orc division sent in search of the “egg”?${prompt}
  9018: Yes, I believe it is reasonable to assume so.${prompt}
  9019: Do you think Altennia's unit is okay?${prompt}
  9020: Judging by the condition of our messenger, I imagine there is a distinct possibility...${prompt}
  9021: Rahal!${prompt}
  9022: Yes, my prince!?
  9023: I refuse to abandon hope. We must dispatch a rescue unit at once.${prompt}
  9024: How about you, Brother? What do you plan to do?${prompt}
  9025: Lord Excenmille and I will meet with Father and ask for permission to form a unit to deal with the Orcish unit.${prompt}
  9026: Yes, my prince. As you command.${prompt}
  9027: Hmph. I expected you to storm out of here while complaining we have no time to waste.${prompt}
  9028: I want you to come with us. I could use some advice on how to approach Father.${prompt}
  9029: Will wonders never cease... I am fine to accompany you, but I would like to hear everything again from the beginning.${prompt}
  9030: I need your help too, ${name-player}. Please head to the Beaucedine Glacier at once.${prompt}
  9031: I want you to gather as much information as possible for when we rendezvous with you later.${prompt}
  9032: |-
    Accept Trion's request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  9033: You have my gratitude.${prompt}
  9034: Are you purposely trying to incur my wrath?${prompt}
  9035: We will make due without it then. The Orcs have already inflicted grievous injury upon my knights, and I am seething with rage.${prompt}
  9036: I am asking for your help because I believe in you. That is why I want you to go to our knights on my behalf.${prompt}
  9037: Rahal! I am counting on you!${prompt}
  9038: Yes, my prince!
  9039: Thank you for your assistance. First, head for the tower that lies in the center of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt}
  9040: Altennia's latest report states that the tower serves as a base for expeditions to every corner of the glacier.${prompt}
  9041: |-
    Please try to conceal your presence as much as possible; we don't want you to be spotted by the Orcs along the way.
    May the divine Goddess bless your journey.${prompt}
  9042: Time is of the essence. We must begin making preparations if we are to rescue Altennia's unit.${prompt}
  9043: |-
    First, head for the tower in the center of the Beaucedine Glacier.
    I only hope that Altennia's unit left behind some kind of clue...${prompt}
  9044: I cannot believe it! Altennia's unit has been attacked by Orcs!?${prompt}
  9045: No, I am sure she will be fine. She was attacked by Orcs before, and she still returned home safely...${prompt}
  9046: |-
    You are still unsure of the whereabouts of Altennia and her troops?
    Please work with Excenmille to find them as soon as possible.${prompt}
  9047: If we dispatch the rescue unit without knowing their exact location, it will only lead to more casualties.${prompt}
  9048: |-
    ${name-player}, I am counting on you to save Altennia.
    As her brother, I will do what I can to assist you.${prompt}
  9049: I see! So Altennia's unit wasn't wiped out, but is being held captive at Fei'Yin!${prompt}
  9050: |-
    If you are joining Excenmille on the rescue attempt, be sure to follow his instructions to the letter.
    Nobody is more experienced with snowy mountain terrain than him.${prompt}
  9051: The first wave of the rescue unit has already set out for Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  9052: Hang in there, Altennia. We'll be there soon...${prompt}
  9053: You needn't worry about Altennia and her unit. They've returned home safely.${prompt}
  9054: |-
    The injured are being attended to and should make a full recovery from their wounds.
    As for their spiritual wounds, however...${prompt}
  9055: |-
    ${name-player}, I would like to reward you for your meritorious service.
    I am certain we will require your assistance again in the future.${prompt}
  9056: Ah, ${name-player}! We have been waiting for you!${prompt}
  9057: I was surprised upon hearing Lord Excenmille's report regarding your efforts against the Orcs up north!${prompt}
  9058: You must tell me what happened!${prompt}
  9059: So the Orcish unit that so easily captured Altennia and her knights has been wiped out...${prompt}
  9060: And it was the “World Eater Egg” and its contents that caused such an event to transpire...${prompt}
  9061: Brother, Excenmille said in his report that the Orcish unit was eaten by the egg...${prompt}
  9062: I imagine this “egg” contains some kind of creature that devours anything placed before it.${prompt}
  9063: I thought that the Orcs' activities had something to do with Lightbringer, but that appears to not be the case.${prompt}
  9064: |-
    Pardon the interruption!
    I have come with urgent news!${prompt}
  9065: |-
    Enter!
    Did you bring her with you, Rahal?${prompt}
  9066: Yes, my prince!
  9067: I must humbly apologize for failing my duties and all of the damage that has been inflicted upon us...
  9068: Stop. This was not your responsibility.${prompt}
  9069: |-
    It is my fault for sending you north without sufficient information.
    I misunderstood the “power” that the Orcs sought.${prompt}
  9070: Still...
  9071: |-
    That is why we must quickly gather and analyze the information we have now.
    Then we can be sure that such a mistake will not happen again.${prompt}
  9072: Yes, my prince. I understand.${prompt}
  9073: |-
    Very well then.
    First, we must discuss the Orc commander, Mukdrom.${prompt}
  9074: We know that Mukdrom was defeated after obtaining the power of the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt}
  9075: '!!!'
  9076: However, his corpse vanished the moment he was taken down.${prompt}
  9077: We have no way of knowing where the egg's power originally came from.${prompt}
  9078: After the battle, there were no traces of the egg to be found.${prompt}
  9079: What is the purpose of this “World Eater Egg”?${prompt}
  9080: When I was held prisoner, I overheard the Orcs happily saying how they had found the egg before some other beastmen did.${prompt}
  9081: Interesting... That must mean that these beastmen were also searching for the egg.${prompt}
  9082: We did receive word that the Orcs had captured some beastmen, including a Goblin and a mandragora...${prompt}
  9083: Yes, that's them! There was also a Meeble and the three of them were causing all kinds of commotion among the Orcs!${prompt}
  9084: They received an audience with Mukdrom regarding the search for a beastman who could withstand the power of the “egg.”${prompt}
  9085: A beastman that can withstand the power of the “egg”...${prompt}
  9086: I suppose that would make them the ultimate beastman?${prompt}
  9087: Twenty years ago, a similar ultimate being appeared, and now it is happening again...${prompt}
  9088: The Shadow Lord...${prompt}
  9089: I-it can't be!
  9090: We cannot be certain, however. In fact, it might be something even worse...${prompt}
  9091: Like the Astral Candescence, it may also affect people and not just beastmen.${prompt}
  9092: |-
    It is also possible that there is more than one “egg” out there too.
    What could these beastmen be planning?${prompt}
  9093: We must capture these three beastmen and learn their intentions.${prompt}
  9094: Rahal, I want you and Altennia to gather any information you can and start tracking them.${prompt}
  9095: Yes, my prince!
  9096: Yes, my prince!
  9097: ${name-player}, if you encounter this beastman trio again, you must get them to reveal their plans by any means necessary.${prompt}
  9098: If such an event comes to pass, you may freely invoke my name as needed.${prompt}
  9099: |-
    In that case, Brother...
    Perhaps you should give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] the you-know-what.${prompt}
  9100: |-
    Hahahaha!
    That is an excellent suggestion, my dear brother!${prompt}
  9101: |-
    ${name-player}, I would like to reward you for your meritorious service.
    I am certain we will require your assistance again in the future.${prompt}
  9102: Personally, I think he should have gone with the gold one instead, but oh well...${prompt}
  9103: |-
    ${name-player}, I would like to reward you for your meritorious service.
    I am certain we will require your assistance again in the future.${prompt}
  9104: That reminds me... Father once spoke of discussing an “egg” with Sir Valaineral...${prompt}
  9105: Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9106: |-
    Hmm... So you have a report for Prince Trion?
    And you say it is in regards to the World Eater Egg?${prompt}
  9107: |-
    Shh! Keep your voice down. I have been told to keep such matters secret.
    Very well, hurry along to Prince Trion.${prompt}
  9108: Enter.
  9109: |-
    Ah, welcome, ${name-player}...
    I was just in the process of telling Excenmille here about the beastman trio.${prompt}
  9110: My lord!
  9111: Their names are Gloom Phantom, Magh Bihu, and Dazbog.${prompt}
  9112: |-
    It sounds like some kind of joke, but they have taken the name of the Destiny Destroyers.
    Apparently, they travel the land, supplied with the currency of both man and beastman...${prompt}
  9113: We have confirmed that they entered Aht Urhgan the other day.${prompt}
  9114: We lost track of them after that, but shortly thereafter, we received word that a citrullus with an unusual number of petals was spotted on Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  9115: They were probably dressed up in some second-rate disguise.${prompt}
  9116: |-
    According to the latest reports, they boarded a pirate ship along the Selbina coast.
    I wonder where their next destination is...${prompt}
  9117: Prince Trion, do you mind if I say something?${prompt}
  9118: What is it?${prompt}
  9119: I wonder if the trio's wandering is because they are searching for a beastman capable of withstanding the power of the World Eater Egg.${prompt}
  9120: I cannot explain it, but I have a strange feeling about the whole thing...${prompt}
  9121: ${name-player}, what did you think about your interaction with them at the Beaucedine Glacier?${prompt}
  9122: |-
    Oooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...
  9123: Ask, and you shall retrieve!
  9124: You were most impressive, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9125: If you had not been here, I would have surely met an ignominious end.${prompt}
  9126: Who goes there!?
  9127: |-
    M-m-my name is Uran-Mafran.
    As you can clearly see, I am a m-m-mage.${prompt}
  9128: As a sign of respect for your fighting prowess, allow m-m-me to explain...${prompt}
  9129: The bodies of living organisms are directly connected to their inner m-m-mind.${prompt}
  9130: The m-m-mind is merely a type of m-m-magic vessel, and as such, has its own corresponding lim-m-mits.${prompt}
  9131: There was great m-m-magic in this Orc's m-m-mind, but it exceeded its limit and thereby caused alterations within its body.${prompt}
  9132: |-
    That egg...
    The Yagudo refer to it as the egg of legend, and say that it possesses frightening power...
  9133: |-
    Indeed, I suppose it is quite dangerous.
    However, my m-m-master told me I m-m-must seek out the egg.${prompt}
  9134: Huh!?
  9135: |-
    What did you do!?
    That's dangerous!${prompt}
  9136: |-
    This orb is quite special.
    It was m-m-made in accordance with the m-m-maelstrom theory.${prompt}
  9137: |-
    Huh!?
    I have no clue what you're talking about...${prompt}
  9138: We plan to continue tracking the egg's scent, and head to the mines in the south.${prompt}
  9139: |-
    Once the egg is broken open, one needs to disavow the egg's power!
    Think you can handle that!?${prompt}
  9140: Hm? You don't plan on using the power for yourself?${prompt}
  9141: |-
    Do you know how dangerous that is!?
    It's too powerful!${prompt}
  9142: |-
    The m-m-mines in the south...
    Do you m-m-mean the Palborough Mines, or the Zeruhn Mines?${prompt}
  9143: |-
    Are you even listening to me?
    The power of the egg must be cast aside, no matter what!${prompt}
  9144: |-
    We shall m-m-meet again.
    Now, please excuse m-m-me.
  9145: '...'
  9146: What just happened?
  9147: |-
    Ooh...
    Memory...complete...${prompt}
  9148: ${name-player}, what is that rather unusual doll!?${prompt}
  9149: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's Professor Koru-Moru's magic doll.
    It's a modified magic doll.
    Its name is Memorian.${prompt}
  9150: Prince Trion, it seems that my memories which were magically sealed away have been restored.${prompt}
  9151: What!?${prompt}
  9152: |-
    It was right after the defeat of Mukdrom at the Beaucedine Glacier.
    There was a mage there named Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  9153: He used some kind of orb to siphon off power from Mukdrom's corpse, and then spoke with Gloom Phantom.${prompt}
  9154: It was then that Gloom Phantom mentioned the need to reject the power of the egg.${prompt}
  9155: I could sense that Uran-Mafran strongly disagreed with that notion though.${prompt}
  9156: |-
    Uran-Mafran...
    That name was in secret missives from both the Republic of Bastok and the Federation of Windurst.${prompt}
  9157: Wha!?
  9158: The letters contained another name--one we all know very well...${prompt}
  9159: |-
    It was you, ${name-player}.
    I assume you are here because you have important news for us.${prompt}
  9160: |-
    Please take us through the situation.
    Try to explain everything as simply as possible.${prompt}
  9161: ${name-player}, you must be tired after such a long journey.${prompt}
  9162: |-
    The World Eater Egg...
    It is an ancient relic, waiting five thousand years to hatch...${prompt}
  9163: It is hard to believe the legends surrounding its creator, the monster known as Chaos.${prompt}
  9164: |-
    I recall the miracle bestowed by the Goddess Altana that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.
    However, I have not heard about anything that predates that point in history.${prompt}
  9165: I was surprised to hear that Gloom Phantom was a descendant of that hero from five thousand years ago.${prompt}
  9166: And also about the sword created by a Dvergar demon that dealt the final blow to Chaos...${prompt}
  9167: |-
    I understand why the Yagudo would want such a weapon.
    However, the enemy we need to be focusing on...${prompt}
  9168: Clearly, it is the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt}
  9169: Those letters I mentioned advised that we proceed with the utmost caution.${prompt}
  9170: Garazu-Horeizu is currently in Valhalla, locked in deadly battle with the dark god Odin.${prompt}
  9171: Recently, there was a report from Aht Urhgan regarding Valhalla, but clearly the two stories were related.${prompt}
  9172: Considering it was a whole other world, we had planned on sitting the conflict out, but it seems we should probably reconsider that stance.${prompt}
  9173: The Kingdom of San d'Oria is closer to the underworld gate than anywhere else in the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  9174: You mean there is a gate to the underworld in the Middle Lands too!?${prompt}
  9175: |-
    Yes, it can be found in Xarcabard of the Valdeaunia region.
    Personally, I believe it to be deep within Castle Zvahl...${prompt}
  9176: Twenty and some odd years ago, the Shadow Lord formed a pact with the dark god and was given an army of demons.${prompt}
  9177: If both the dark god and the demon army live in the land known as Valhalla...${prompt}
  9178: It stands to reason that Castle Zvahl would have been built as a lair to guard the gate between Valhalla and our world.${prompt}
  9179: Actually, I have heard just such a thing while in the Orcish Empire to the north.${prompt}
  9180: The presence of a gate to the underworld would explain all of the demon activity within Valdeaunia in recent years.${prompt}
  9181: According to ${name-player}, the gate to the underworld has been closed, but I wonder if the gate we believe to be within Castle Zvahl has also been shut...${prompt}
  9182: Perhaps we should try capturing a high-level demon in Xarcabard and question it?${prompt}
  9183: |-
    Hmm... I hear that demons can be rather hard to deal with.
    I doubt it will go as easily as we might hope...${prompt}
  9184: Leave it to me, my lord!
  9185: At any rate, everything hinges on the situation in Valhalla.${prompt}
  9186: |-
    All we can do for now is gather information on our foes and prepare for battle.
    Additionally, we can attempt to eliminate any forces that might seek to aid them.${prompt}
  9187: ${name-player}, I do not suppose you know where we can find Uran-Mafran?${prompt}
  9188: |-
    I am thinking to leave that situation to Altennia's unit.
    I hear they have recovered and are currently awaiting new orders.${prompt}
  9189: |-
    That is correct, my lord.
    I was told that they have finished organizing their ranks and are currently engrossed in their daily training regimen.${prompt}
  9190: |-
    Very well.
    I have a request for you too, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9191: As someone who has defeated Uran-Mafran before, I would like you to tell Altennia what to watch out for.${prompt}
  9192: |-
    First, please meet with Rahal in the Royal Knights' Quarters and give him this note.
    He will see that everything is taken care of.${prompt}
  9193: You have been entrusted with orders directly from Prince Trion.${prompt}
  9194: If they are addressed to Rahal, the leader of the Royal Knights, you should head to the Royal Knights' Quarters as soon as possible.${prompt}
  9195: Ah, is that what I think it is?${prompt}
  9196: |-
    I see...
    This is one mission where we should probably keep our voices down.${prompt}
  9197: |-
    You two look like you are up to no good.
    I think I can find some sort of menial task around the royal grounds to give you as punishment.${prompt}
  9198: |-
    Ah, Altennia...
    It's not like that...this time anyway.${prompt}
  9199: That new mission you have been waiting for has finally arrived.${prompt}
  9200: |-
    That is excellent news!
    I have been eagerly awaiting this day!${prompt}
  9201: You sure are resilient, especially given all that you have been through.${prompt}
  9202: |-
    What do you expect?
    The women of House Borel are as tough as they come.${prompt}
  9203: Monarlais Halver is sure to be quite distraught once again, I would imagine.${prompt}
  9204: |-
    Forget about that and tell me about Uran-Mafran already.
    He is a mage that can control people's memories, right?${prompt}
  9205: |-
    Ooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...
  9206: Ask, and you shall retrieve!
  9207: |-
    Ah, a knight of San d'Oria...
    You are awfully far from home.${prompt}
  9208: |-
    Who are you!?
    Actually, it does not matter. Open this door at once!${prompt}
  9209: |-
    Sorry, but I'd rather not.
    You can stay right there until I get the inform-m-mation I need from the Orcs.${prompt}
  9210: |-
    Get information from Orcs? Impossible!
    Mukdrom is a cowardly brute and you will assuredly be made his prisoner too!${prompt}
  9211: |-
    Thanks for the advice.
    Okay now, I think I'll start with that Orcish guard over there.${prompt}
  9212: |-
    Hruh!?
    You there! Halt!${prompt}
  9213: |-
    M-m-my name is Uran-Mafran.
    As you can clearly see, I am a m-m-mage.${prompt}
  9214: I wish to hear more about this “egg” that those of you in Mukdrom's unit discovered.${prompt}
  9215: |-
    I was unable to even scratch that egg, let alone crack it.
    Do you know how to break it open?${prompt}
  9216: |-
    What you talks about!?
    You no touch Lord Mukdrom's precious egg!
  9217: |-
    <Sigh> This guy doesn't know anything.
    This has been a waste of m-m-my time.
  9218: |-
    Ooh...
    Memory...complete...${prompt}
  9219: Altennia! Are you all right!?${prompt}
  9220: |-
    I remember now...
    I met Uran-Mafran before.${prompt}
  9221: |-
    You what!?
    When!? And where!?${prompt}
  9222: It was when I was captured by Mukdrom's men and held within the Fei'Yin ruins.${prompt}
  9223: Uran-Mafran was looking for a way to break open an egg known as the World Eater Egg.${prompt}
  9224: He tried to break it open, but said he was not able to, no matter what he tried.${prompt}
  9225: ${name-player}, clearly this mage Uran-Mafran is capable of wielding powerful magic.${prompt}
  9226: |-
    That is like music to my ears.
    The fact that he is no ordinary opponent shall make him a worthy challenge.${prompt}
  9227: Hmm... Prince Trion's letter mentioned a need to protect ourselves against powerful magic...${prompt}
  9228: ${name-player}, do you think I could borrow that magic doll for a bit?${prompt}
  9229: |-
    Lend him the magic doll?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, no problem.
    Sorry, can't do that.${prompt}
  9230: |-
    Ooh...
    Do so...and all is finished...
    Magic...finished...${prompt}
  9231: |-
    I do not think that is going to work.
    Besides, it gives me the creeps, so let us look for another way.${prompt}
  9232: ${name-player}, can you give us some more details about your fight against Uran-Mafran?${prompt}
  9233: He sounds like a formidable foe indeed...${prompt}
  9234: You mentioned that a demon was able to turn his memory magic back against him.${prompt}
  9235: What is it, Rahal?${prompt}
  9236: |-
    Growing up, my father used to tell me a bedtime story that might prove useful.
    It was a fable about the Last Dragoon.${prompt}
  9237: |-
    The brave hero struggled mightily against an evil dragon's magical flames.
    In response, he sought a “demon's shell” that was said to repel any type of magic.${prompt}
  9238: |-
    It took all of his wisdom, but he eventually captured a demon and attempted to remove its shell.
    However, the demon begged for its life and offered to make a deal instead.${prompt}
  9239: 'It taught the hero how to make a shield that could reflect magic, as well as where to find the most important ingredient, a legendary mineral known as ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9240: |-
    What!? Is that true!?
    There is a mineral that can reflect magic!?${prompt}
  9241: |-
    I have heard that subsequent investigations have proven the story to be true.
    At the very least, I suppose it is worth looking into.${prompt}
  9242: So where can you find this mineral?${prompt}
  9243: |-
    It is located far to the south, in a mountain called Mount Yuhtunga on Elshimo Island.
    There, you can find a spot known as Ifrit's Cauldron.${prompt}
  9244: |-
    That is all the way across the sea...
    I am not familiar with that area, and I doubt I can even set foot on that island without going through the proper channels first.${prompt}
  9245: |-
    You, on the other hand, ${name-player}...
    Can we ask for your help in this matter?${prompt}
  9246: |-
    Just a single piece of ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will do.
    Naturally, I will pay you for your assistance.${prompt}
  9247: |-
    Will you help Altennia?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me.
    Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt}
  9248: |-
    What!? I will prepare a proper reward for you...
    I shall even ask Prince Trion if need be.
    Please!${prompt}
  9249: |-
    Thank you so much, ${name-player}!
    I shall be sure to inform my brother of your kindness!${prompt}
  9250: |-
    Sorry for the trouble, ${name-player}.
    While you are gone, we shall speak with some blacksmiths that specialize in working with shields.${prompt}
  9251: |-
    Altennia has been tasked with capturing this Uran-Mafran.
    Please help her find some ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9252: |-
    It supposedly can be found within Ifrit's Cauldron on Elshimo Island's Mount Yuhtunga.
    There is a chance that it may not be so easy to find though...${prompt}
  9253: |-
    We will prepare the other materials, such as the ${item-singular: 2[2]}, here.
    You do not need to worry about them.${prompt}
  9254: '${name-player}, were you able to find some ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  9255: |-
    I am amazed that you found it so quickly!
    Altennia will be pleased!${prompt}
  9256: Thank you again, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9257: While you were gone, we consulted the literature and spoke with several blacksmiths.${prompt}
  9258: 'It seems that with this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, we will actually be able to make the legendary shield!${prompt}'
  9259: Naturally, it is not indestructible, but if it can reflect back Uran-Mafran's magic just once or twice, it will at least give us a chance at victory.${prompt}
  9260: |-
    So feel free to relax.
    You can leave Uran-Mafran to us.${prompt}
  9261: We definitely do not need that creepy doll anymore, either.${prompt}
  9262: '...${prompt}'
  9263: |-
    Oh, that reminds me...
    I received this gift for you from Prince Trion.${prompt}
  9264: |-
    Please accept it with our heartfelt gratitude.
    I am certain it will aid you in your travels to come.${prompt}
  9265: |-
    I look forward to our next meeting.
    Until then, I pray that you remain in good health.${prompt}
  9266: Farewell.${prompt}
  9267: |-
    Ooh...
    Memories...remain...
    Find...those that are hidden...${prompt}
  9268: |-
    Ooh...
    All...memories...
    Found... Quest complete...${prompt}
  9269: |-
    You are a brave soul indeed to forget a gift from Prince Trion.
    I think you should take it before someone notices.${prompt}
  9270: Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9271: The other day, a strange man claiming to be a messenger from the underworld paid me a visit late at night.${prompt}
  9272: It took until morning, but he told me of your tales of adventure.${prompt}
  9273: He told me all about the World Eater Egg, Chaos, the Maelstrom Mage Garazu-Horeizu...${prompt}
  9274: I heard you eliminated the traitors and defended both the lands of Valhalla and Vana'diel?${prompt}
  9275: So what he said is true...${prompt}
  9276: I took it upon myself to report the news to the king and the rest of the royal family.${prompt}
  9277: |-
    That reminds me, Prince Trion should be back by now.
    I shall take you to him.${prompt}
  9278: Ah, your timing is impeccable.${prompt}
  9279: I was unsure if we could trust the messenger that visited Halver.${prompt}
  9280: However, I can tell from the look on your face that everything he said about you was true!${prompt}
  9281: As such, I too must offer my gratitude for your service.${prompt}
  9282: |-
    The World Eater Egg, the Maelstrom Mage Garazu-Horeizu, your battle against Chaos...
    You have walked a most difficult path.${prompt}
  9283: I suppose this means that you safely defended Valhalla and the souls of the heroes that reside there?${prompt}
  9284: I imagine that the souls of many of our knights must reside there as well.${prompt}
  9285: |-
    I suppose the day I meet them in person will come eventually.
    I must endeavor to prepare for the moment when it finally arrives.${prompt}
  9286: |-
    Ah, yes...
    While you were accompanied by that group of beastmen, we formed an alliance with the other two nations and have been conducting research alongside them.${prompt}
  9287: We wish to see what kind of effect the Maelstrom Mage and Chaos have had on Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9288: Perhaps the most obvious example is the presence of the dead that still wander the land.${prompt}
  9289: After that would be the mage Uran-Mafran, who is being pursued by Altennia as we speak.${prompt}
  9290: As everyone is well aware, he was the Maelstrom Mage's disciple.${prompt}
  9291: We are sharing intelligence with the Federation of Windurst regarding the matter, and plan to deal with him together.${prompt}
  9292: Lastly, in regards to the beastmen--especially the Orcs of the Rhazowa continent to the north...${prompt}
  9293: Excenmille reports that several ships have been spotted in the Nosteau Ocean headed for Rhazowa.${prompt}
  9294: It would seem that they are returning to the Orcish Empire.${prompt}
  9295: However, it is unclear whether this is an effort to regroup their forces, or merely a resupply mission.${prompt}
  9296: |-
    As such, we may be asking for your assistance again in the near future.
    I hope that we can count on your cooperation.${prompt}
  9297: |-
    That is enough for now though.
    It is time to free your mind of thought and simply rest after such a long ordeal.${prompt}
  9298: Your new adventures can wait for the time being.${prompt}
  9299: |-
    I hear that Prince Trion is singing your praises.
    Do not forget this token of our kingdom's appreciation.${prompt}
  9300: ${name-player}, I hear that Prince Trion is singing your praises.${prompt}
  9301: Although, there still remain the issues of the Orcish Empire and also the mage that my sister is pursuing...${prompt}
  9302: |-
    Enough about that though, this is a time to celebrate our victory.
    Indeed, that is what I plan to do.${prompt}
