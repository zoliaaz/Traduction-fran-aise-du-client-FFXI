    Yes, yes, trust is good for the soul.
    Now, if you'll allow me, hee hee hee...${prompt}
  7129: The deed is done. The rest is up to you to wield it as you have thus far.${prompt}
  7130: An invisible, mystical energy resides within your weapon. I would explain the n-n-nature of this energy in more detail, but I fear it is beyond the comprehension of a layperson.${prompt}
  7131: Wh-what? You doubt my kn-kn-knowledge on the subject!?${prompt}
  7132: Hmph. I won't deny that research is still ongoing. I do know, however, that those who venture deeper within the Nyzul Isle develop g-g-greater affinity with these artifacts.${prompt}
  7133: 'So indeed, if you''ve already come to be in p-p-possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you can expect stupendous results.${prompt}'
  7134: Note, though, that I have merely awakened your weapon from its long s-s-slumber. You must, through usage, accumulate said energy to the point of saturation.${prompt}
  7135: With that accomplished, a m-m-most extraordinary evolution will take place.${prompt}
  7136: When that happens, bring the weapon to me. I promise it'll be a profitable v-v-venture for you...and yours truly, too. Ahee hee hee...${prompt}
  7137: When you sense a ch-ch-change has occurred within your weapon, bring it to me. I promise you won't regret it.${prompt}

    Hmm...
    I sense only a mote of energy p-p-present. You still have a long way to go, it seems.${prompt}

    Aaah, yes...
    I can feel a marked increase in energy compared to when I first held it. Keep up the good w-w-work, hee hee hee...${prompt}

    Goodness g-g-gracious me!

  7160: Alors, vous êtes le nouveau attaché diplomatique. Quoi, vous avez un message secret de l'archiduc ? Bon, laissez-moi voir ça.${prompt}
  7161: Je vois. Merci de me l'avoir apporté. Ça dit que je suis censé vous parler du magicite.${prompt}
  7162: La magicite se trouve au fin fond du château d'Oztroja, de Davoi et de Beadeaux. Mais ces endroits grouillent de bêtes, et ces bêtes sont plutôt rusées.${prompt}
  7163: Vous aurez besoin de ceci pour entrer dans Beadeaux.${prompt}

  7165: Qu'est-ce que c'est, Verena ? Ne vois-tu pas que j'ai un invité ?${prompt}
  7166: Je sais. C'est à propos de ça.${prompt}
  7167: J'ai entendu dire que l'archiduc a fait une déclaration...${prompt}
  7168: Il a ordonné à toutes les bêtes de Jeuno de partir. Il doit penser que ce n'est plus sûr de les avoir ici.${prompt}
  7169: Quoi ? Je pense que ces idiots dans le palais sont bien pires que n'importe quelle bête que nous avons ici !${prompt}
  7170: C'est comme s'ils portaient des masques... on ne peut pas savoir ce qu'ils pensent. Et leurs yeux sont comme des pierres froides. Tu ne vas pas suivre cet ordre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7171: Eh bien, je comprends ce que tu ressens, mais avec les bêtes qui font des ravages là-bas, on ne peut pas blâmer les gens de se sentir nerveux à propos de celles qui sont ici.${prompt}
  7172: Tu as entendu parler de tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7173: Oui, j'ai entendu. Mais les bêtes en ville n'ont jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
  7174: Je le sais, Verena... Mais je ne pense pas que le Jeunoan moyen serait d'accord.${prompt}
  7175: Non...${prompt}
  7176: Peut-être que c'est la chose sage à faire. Vous savez, agir avant que les choses ne dégénèrent.${prompt}
  7177: Eh bien, je verrai si je peux penser à une meilleure alternative. Ne vous inquiétez pas. Je serais le dernier à les chasser de la ville.${prompt}
  7178: D'accord. Vous avez promis, souvenez-vous-en !${prompt}
  7179: Verena...${prompt}

  7185: Oh, très bien. Eh bien, allons-y !${prompt}
  7186: Euh, d'accord.${prompt}
  7187: La magicite se trouve au fin fond du château d'Oztroja, de Davoi et de Beadeaux. Ces endroits sont infestés de bêtes meurtrières, et leurs pièges sont rusés.${prompt}
  7188: Aucune rumeur n'échappe à Jeuno. Je parie que vous pouvez trouver ce dont vous avez besoin auprès d'autres aventuriers. Que votre force ne défaille jamais !${prompt}
  7189: Quoi ? Vous dites que les bêtes pourraient comploter quelque chose d'autre ? Ouais, ça ne serait pas dans leurs habitudes de simplement abandonner.${prompt}
  7190: Je ne veux plus avoir affaire aux bêtes. Je parie que le vieux Goblin Muckvix en sait plus, mais vous devrez lui demander vous-même.${prompt}
  7191: Verena est vraiment inquiète pour Fickblix. Mieux vaut ne pas mentionner les bêtes en sa présence.${prompt}
  7192: Je me demande qui est pire, nous ou eux ? Fickie n'a jamais fait de mal à personne.${prompt}
  7193: Juste parce qu'ils ne sont pas humains ne veut pas dire que nous devrions les détester. Même un enfant comme Fickie est traité comme de la saleté.${prompt}
  7194: Je ne sais plus ce qui est juste ou faux. Je ne peux aider personne. Je suis désolé.${prompt}
  7195: Quoi ? Les graines de Fickie ont commencé à pousser ? Hé, qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec moi, hein ?${prompt}

  7199: Aldo, je...${prompt}
  7200: Verena, j'ai entendu dire que vos fleurs ont commencé à pousser. Je parie que vous les avez arrosées généreusement, tous les enfants. Ce genre de graine ne prend pas racine si facilement.${prompt}
  7201: Peut-être que tout ce que vous et Fickblix avez accompli signifie vraiment quelque chose.${prompt}
  7202: Récemment, je... Je ne l'ai pas arrosé. Je n'ai pensé qu'à moi-même. Je suis tellement désolé, Fickie.${prompt}
  7203: Oui, peut-être que ce n'est pas une question de ce qui est bien et ce qui est mal.${prompt}
  7204: Rien ne serait mieux que d'éviter un autre conflit... Pour nous, et pour eux.${prompt}
  7205: D'accord ! Je ne sais pas ce que nous pouvons faire, mais j'aiderai. Fickie ne nous pardonnerait jamais si nous restions silencieux.${prompt}
  7206: C'est vrai ! Le moins que nous puissions faire, c'est essayer.${prompt}
  7207: Mais je ne sais pas si nous pouvons découvrir ce que leur petit groupe manigance.${prompt}
  7208: Je suppose que nous pourrions demander à Muckvix.${prompt}
  7209: Mais est-ce qu'il aiderait ? Il essaie toujours de rester en dehors de ces affaires raciales.${prompt}
  7210: Et s'il nous disait quelque chose, il trahirait les siens.${prompt}
  7211: Ouais, je sais. Mais il n'y a rien d'autre que nous puissions faire. ${name-player}, est-ce que ça vous dérangerait de demander à Muckvix ? Nous irons là-bas plus tard.${prompt}
  7212: Hé, j'ai rien à vous dire. Dégagez.${prompt}
  7213: Nous avons aussi besoin de votre aide, Muckvix.${prompt}
  7214: Oh, donc vous êtes là-dedans aussi, hein ? Qu'est-ce que vous essayez de faire ?${prompt}
  7215: S'il te plaît, Muck. Tu es notre seul espoir. Jeuno - non, le monde entier est en danger à moins que tu ne nous dises.${prompt}
  7216: Hé, je vis ici depuis des lustres, mais quand ça compte vraiment, je ne suis qu'une bestiole, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  7217: Vous n'allez rien obtenir de moi. Voyez-vous, nous les bestioles, nous sommes tous frères.${prompt}
  7218: Muck, tu ne nous considères pas comme les tiens, mais ces enfants et moi avons aidé les graines de Fickie à pousser... Pour nous, les gens et les bêtes sont les mêmes. Nous sommes tous un et le même !${prompt}
  7219: Et maintenant, la chance pour la paix est en danger. S'il te plaît, Muck, dis-nous !${prompt}
  7220: La chance pour la paix, hein ? Oh, ce Fickie... Que ferait-il s'il était ici ?${prompt}
  7221: Oh, bon sang. Mais juste cette fois ! Et seulement parce que je dois ça à ton père. Que mes gens me pardonnent...${prompt}
  7222: D'accord, donc l'équipage que vous cherchez a toujours été un peu froid envers nous.${prompt}
  7223: Ce ne sont que des durs à cuire, mais parfois ils deviennent fous. J'ai entendu dire qu'ils devenaient une grande bande, donc ils doivent être en train de préparer quelque chose !${prompt}
  7224: Essayez de regarder autour du Nécropole d'Eldieme. J'ai entendu dire que les clochards qui ont quitté Davoi se cachent là-bas. Et je ne vais pas en dire plus !${prompt}

  7416: Nothing's more pathetic than a broken-hearted man.${prompt}
  7417: He's forgotten why he took up the lute in the first place. Well, it's something we all have to face some time or another.${prompt}
  7418: Some men give up and turn back. But most find a way over it, while some are strong enough to bust right through. That's when you finally become someone.${prompt}
  7419: He's at his own crossroads. He has to figure it out for himself.${prompt}
  7420: Have you heard of Lewenhart?${prompt}
  7421: Everywhere he goes, fantastic melodies follow. He is the bard for all bards, a legend among our kind.${prompt}
  7422: He should still be wandering somewhere out there, but nobody has seen him for ages.${prompt}
  7423: Someone of his stature could easily settle down and live quite comfortably. Perhaps he'll keep wandering his whole life. Who knows what thoughts such a creative mind entertains?${prompt}
  7424: So now you're one of us, huh? Well, may we bring much harmony to this world!${prompt}
  7425: What? You could be such a fine bard! What are you thinking? We could bring so much harmony to this world!${prompt}
  7426: Say, have you seen the song rrrunes in Buburimu? They contain the words to the song that torn-apart lovers sang to each other many years ago.${prompt}
  7427: The lyrics are simple, but they hit you right in the heart. It's a really good song!${prompt}
  7428: No matter how much the worrrld changes, people are still the same. Oh, how I long to be loved like that...${prompt}
  7429: Well, anyway... I bet those bitter lyrics would rrreally cheer up the broken-hearted.${prompt}
  7430: Oh, you've been to Buburimu? They say couples descend on the place at nightfall. How do they dodge the monsterrrs?${prompt}
  7431: And you know what? There's another set of rrrunes in Valkurm...with the opposing set of lyrics! It's a fabulous spot for a date; take it from me.${prompt}
  7432: When you rrread the lyrics on Buburimu after you've seen the ones on Valkurm, it brings the tears all over again. Oh, sad songs are so moving!${prompt}
  7433: Oh, you're a barrrd too? Then stop by more often!${prompt}
  7434: Say, you should be a barrrd. What are you thinking?${prompt}
  7435: See! That man by the table looks so full of life, doesn't he? Of course, not long ago I wouldn't have stood near him!${prompt}
  7436: This song's so old... Are you making fun of me, with this old song!?${prompt}
  7437: Now, now, my young friend. What's all that fuss? Come, let me get you something.${prompt}
  7438: I thought you were like me, a man who lives for song and dance. Was I wrong?${prompt}
  7439: Who are you? Leave me alone!${prompt}
  7440: Oh, come, now... Oh, you were talking about that song. It's a great tune, isn't it?${prompt}
  7441: No it ain't! Nobody cares about such an oldie.${prompt}
  7442: Well, my apologies, but have you ever even tried it? Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not good, you know.${prompt}
  7443: Hmm...${prompt}
  7444: Just give it a try. What have you got to lose?${prompt}
  7445: Good to see you again.${prompt}
  7446: I have a feeling we'll meet again. I hope by then you'll have learned to appreciate this song.${prompt}
  7447: I've seen him before, somewhere...${prompt}
  7448: Who does he think he is? He doesn't know a thing about all the pain I've gone through!${prompt}
  7449: Wait, could he be...? Naw, he couldn't be.${prompt}
  7450: It's you! Thank you so much!${prompt}

  7462: No problem. I was just going to head out to Castle Oztroja right now.${prompt}
  7463: Hey, whaddaya tryin' to say? I never asked you to head out there.${prompt}
  7464: I was just playing with Verena, but she's feeling down. And I know why.${prompt}
  7465: The beasties outside town are getting restless. That makes Verena worried. So I'm going to Oztroja and ask them to settle down.${prompt}
  7466: I think the beasties outside can get along with people, like I could with Verena. I really believe so.${prompt}
  7467: Yeah, maybe you got a point there.${prompt}
  7468: Well, I'm off.${prompt}
  7469: Hey, Fickie...${prompt}

  7471: You be careful out there.${prompt}
  7472: I'll be okay. They'll listen to me.${prompt}
  7473: Yeah, my generation can't forget the war, so it's real hard to relate.${prompt}
  7474: But you kids don't remember none of that. So I think you can bridge the gap. Yeah, for all of us!${prompt}
  7475: Fickie? Is Fickie here?${prompt}
  7476: Hey, you just missed him. Said somethin' about goin' to Castle Oztroja. You didn't see him on your way in here?${prompt}
  7477: No, it's just... Some adventurers said they were going out to hunt beastmen, so I got so worried...${prompt}
  7478: I always told him to stay here in town. I told him if people found him in a dungeon somewhere, they might mistake him for a bad beastman, and then they'd...${prompt}
  7479: Ain't nothin' you can do. That kid's a beastie, and even the people in this town give us the cold shoulder.${prompt}
  7480: Well, he don't belong out there none neither... But I still think he's safer out there than in here.${prompt}
  7481: I'm so worried about him.${prompt}
  7482: That girl understands things that only us beasties do. Maybe Fickie and her can break down the walls that keep us apart.${prompt}
  7483: I just hope they watch out for those guys cravin' that mysterious power.${prompt}
  7484: Oops... Hey, forget about it.${prompt}
  7485: Hey, Fickie's nothin' but an outsider here. Now, he don't belong out there none neither, but I think they'll treat him better.${prompt}

  7760: Oh, mon Dieu... Il y en a tellement à choisir ! Je ne sais pas quoi choisir. Au fait, est-ce que ça me va bien ?${prompt}
  7761: Je ne pense pas. J'ai besoin de quelque chose qui ressorte et crie "moi". Hmm... Que choisir...${prompt}
  7762: Oh, j'adore les bijoux. Je pourrais rester là et regarder des diamants toute la journée. Pourquoi les hommes ne comprennent-ils pas ?${prompt}
  7763: Pourquoi les femmes s'extasient-elles toujours sur les diamants ? Je ne comprends pas du tout.${prompt}
  7764: Elle s'amuse, alors c'est bien. J'aimerais juste qu'elle se dépêche de choisir quelque chose !${prompt}

  7771: Wow, donc vous êtes attiré par le type pur et innocent, hein ? Ouais, elle est vraiment mignonne.${prompt}

  7783: Jeuno est une ville spéciale. Nous sommes un melting-pot de toutes sortes de gens différents. J'adore cette ville.${prompt}
  7784: Bien sûr, parfois, nous échouons à comprendre à quel point nous sommes tous différents. C'est juste le genre de chose que nous devons éviter.${prompt}

  7789: Pour moi, la vente aux enchères est comme un jeu d'intelligence entre moi et les autres enchérisseurs.${prompt}
  7790: Vous devez toujours surveiller ce que vous voulez vraiment et combien vous êtes prêt à payer pour cela. Il est si facile de se laisser emporter !${prompt}
  7791: Quand j'étais jeune fille, je suivais souvent mon amoureux jusqu'à cette fontaine. Il ne disait presque rien, tellement il était timide !${prompt}

    Qu'est-ce que la maison des enchères ?
    Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
    Y a-t-il des frais ?
    Y a-t-il des limites ?
    Comment vérifiez-vous les marchandises ?
    Comment supprimez-vous un article ?
    Ma liste de "Statut des ventes" est pleine !
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  7828: Les maisons de vente aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les principales villes de Vana'diel. C'est là que les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les vieilles armures... presque tout.${prompt}
  7829: Actuellement, les maisons de vente aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix diffèrent d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  7830: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de vente aux enchères, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  7831: Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou plus achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  7832: Une fois mis en vente aux enchères, un article restera là pendant un maximum de trente semaines, temps Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi, temps terrestre).${prompt}
  7833: Si un article ne se vend pas dans ce délai, il sera renvoyé à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  7834: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis en vente aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles simples et les articles empilables.${prompt}
  7835: Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsque n'importe quelle marchandise est mise en vente aux enchères. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
  7836: Le Comité international des maisons de vente aux enchères, ou CIHVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles pouvaient être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
  7837: Cependant, le CIHVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles qu'une personne peut acheter.${prompt}
  7838: Un petit laps de temps est nécessaire avant que de nouveaux articles n'apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
  7839: Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste "Statut des ventes", il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
  7840: Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une vente aux enchères, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de vente aux enchères et sélectionner "Arrêter la vente" dans le menu "Statut des ventes".${prompt}
  7841: Pour supprimer un article de votre liste "Statut des ventes", vous devez visiter un comptoir de vente aux enchères pour confirmer la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
  7842: Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
  7843: À n'importe quel comptoir de vente aux enchères, ouvrez le menu "Statut des ventes" et confirmez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
  7844: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}

  7936: 'The task I have called you here for today is to deliver a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to each of the thieves of Atarefaunet''s band.${prompt}'
  7937: |-
    Why would you want us to do that? Do you mean to bring them together to form a new thieving group?
    ...Damn!${prompt}
  7938: |-
    No, of course not.
    What could thieves of twenty years ago accomplish now?${prompt}
  7939: Nevertheless, it would not be wise to leave them to their own devices. It's possible that some amongst them might seek to regain the glory of the past.${prompt}
  7940: The Tenshodo simply wishes to measure their intentions. If those members plan on beginning any activities, we ask that they inform us about it.${prompt}
  7941: '...That is the main point of the message in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  7942: However, it is not certain that they will just meekly sign the papers. My job is to make certain these brigands follow the will of the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  7943: And that is where you come in. Use your knowledge and talents to get those signatures and bring them back here to me.${prompt}
  7944: I will now hand each of you a sealed envelope. Seek out the member whose name is revealed therein.${prompt}
  7945: Lastly, it is against thieving etiquette to sneak a look at the members assigned to people other than yourself. As I'm sure you are aware, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing in this business...${prompt}
  7946: Now, please come to me one at a time to receive your envelope.${prompt}
  7947: You are the adventurer thief ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7948: Since you are an adventurer, I will give you the member who requires the most muscle to deal with. Go and meet with the Galka staying at the inn located in the town of Selbina.${prompt}
  7949: You have completed your assignment?${prompt}
  7950: Vauderame is waiting for you in the same room as before. Go and present your report.${prompt}
  7951: |-
    It appears the Galka gave you some trouble, as I expected.
    Your face tells of trying times.${prompt}
  7952: I'm ba-ack!${prompt}
  7953: Ah, Nanaa Mihgo, that makes everyone.${prompt}
  7954: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    Gather everyone together. It's time to begin.${prompt}
  7955: I thank you all for flawlessly completing the task I set.${prompt}
  7956: As a reward, I will give each of you a weapon designed specifically for thieves. Please come to me one at a time.${prompt}
  7957: Hey, we don't trust you people none, but we can always smell a profit!${prompt}
  7958: Hey, daredevil... You lookin' for Pauluart? He comes here lots.${prompt}
  7959: Let's roll some dice. Loser gets to see Pauluart and get killed.${prompt}
  7960: |-
    Roll the dice?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's do it.
    Just a minute.${prompt}
  7961: '${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!'
  7962: '${color-alt: 121}Sniggnix rolls the die and gets a ${number: 3}!'
  7963: 'Here''s your chance. Go to Dangruf Wadi and find Dangruf brothers. They have ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7964: Uh-oh.${prompt}
  7965: That ain't good.${prompt}
  7966: |-
    You got ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    If you have that die, you win against Pauluart.${prompt}
  7967: If you lose, say, “Smaller number wins.”${prompt}
  7968: Wait outside. I go get Pauluart and come back.${prompt}
  7969: You were looking for me?${prompt}
  7970: |-
    You call yourself ${name-player}?
    I have no memory of that name. What do you want with me?${prompt}
  7971: |-
    ...You want my signature again?
    This is most irregular. How embarrassing for the Tenshodo to have to go over the same ground twice. Doesn't exactly inspire faith now, does it?${prompt}
  7972: '...Nevertheless, I have been given this opportunity to be out here in the fresh air and speak with people after being cooped up inside for such a long time. Let''s leave it up to this impartial die to decide whether this encounter was a fortunate one or not.${prompt}'
  7973: I see you are carrying dice as well. If you say you are here without guile, then roll the die. It will judge your innocence.${prompt}
  7974: |-
    However...
    If the die judges you have evil intent, this knife will carry out your sentence...${prompt}
  7975: "You can't escape. You are now in the hands of Fate. \nLife. Death. Everything rests on the roll of the die.${prompt}"
  7976: "If you beat my die, then victory is yours. \nNow, roll.${prompt}"
  7977: '${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!'
  7978: |-
    This is ominous.
    You appear to be quite the villain. Now it is my turn. Please hand me the die.${prompt}
  7979: '${color-alt: 121}Pauluart rolls the die and gets 789!'
  7980: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I win! Your die has judged you unworthy. Prepare to receive your sentence.${prompt}
  7981: |-
    Yell out?
    ${selection-lines}
    The smaller number wins!${prompt}
  7982: |-
    ...What?
    Huh? This die...${prompt}
  7983: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}...
    ...Ah, this is...
    Sniggnix, you've been telling secrets again.${prompt}
  7984: |-
    You win this time.
    I suppose I'll sign the papers for you.
    It's a shame, for I had hoped to feel the warmth of fresh blood again...${prompt}
  7985: Please send my friends my regards. And to your friends also.
  7986: |-
    You rolled lower number, right?
    This die, also called “Sinner's Die.”
    When you roll that die, they tell the weight of your sins.${prompt}
  7987: |-
    Pauluart's sins, far greater than yours.
    He has no right to judge your guilt.${prompt}
  7988: Move it, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/lady]. I'm not here for you.${prompt}
  7989: |-
    Yeah, I remember you.
    You heard the rumor that Atarefaunet's band hid their treasure in that damn Garlaige Citadel?${prompt}
  7990: |-
    ...That's not why you're here?
    You've got something to ask me? Well, then you'd better damn well get it over with. I'm a busy man.${prompt}
  7991: And if I tell you? There's no profit to be had in sticking your damn nose into finished business, friend.${prompt}
  7992: |-
    Alright then.
    I guess that's your damn problem. If you get me some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, then I'll help you.${prompt}
  7993: |-
    Here's the damn deal.
    Bring me four ${item-plural: 1[2]} that alchemists are said to make. Then we'll talk.${prompt}
  7994: |-
    Don't make me repeat myself, dammit!
    I want four ${item-plural: 1[2]} that the alchemists make. Then we have a deal.${prompt}
  7995: |-
    I thought about joining in on the hunt for the treasure...
    It's almost definitely hidden in that damn Garlaige Citadel somewhere.${prompt}
  7996: |-
    You got them!
    I couldn't make the damn things myself.${prompt}
  7997: Now I can get my work done. And eat some damn good food.${prompt}
  7998: |-
    ...Now, to answer your damn question.
    The signature on my papers was an “O.”${prompt}
  7999: I don't know what you're planning, but be damn careful. That Vauderame isn't a man you mess with lightly.${prompt}
  8000: If I didn't have this damn assignment, I would have joined in on the treasure hunt. Things happen for a reason, I guess.${prompt}
  8001: |-
    Remember this.
    Thieves' work and adventuring don't go hand in hand. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Damn straight!${prompt}
  8002: What? A toolbox that won't open? Oh, yeah... A long time ago I took a strange box from one of Brugaire's warehouses.${prompt}
  8003: The box was old and filthy, but I couldn't wait to pry it open and see the treasure inside. But it simply wouldn't open!${prompt}
  8004: 'Wait, are you looking for that box? Hmm... I''ll sell it to you for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  8005: |-
    Well?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fine, I'll take it.
    No, thanks.${prompt}
  8006: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not telling you where it is, then!${prompt}
  8007: That's the spirit, my fine customer!${prompt}
  8008: I left the toolbox on top of a crate outside the Duty-Free shop in Port Jeuno. Till just now I had completely forgotten it!${prompt}
  8009: Look, the toolbox is on top of a crate outside of Port Jeuno's Duty-Free shop. Go ahead and take it.${prompt}
  8010: Hey, what are you tryin' to pull? Get lost!${prompt}
  8011: Sorry, I'm busy. Something awful has happened, and it'll take one helluva beastmaster to sort it out.${prompt}
  8012: Perfect timing! We were hoping to find a renowned beastmaster like you to take care of a little problem.${prompt}
  8013: You see, the beasts who inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like they're under someone's control. They've attacked adventurers, and recently killed one!${prompt}
  8014: People suspect we beastmasters have something to do with it. You should know we'd never do anything like that. Won't you look into this for us?${prompt}
  8015: You see, the beasts that inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like someone or something is controlling them. Could you look into it for us?${prompt}
  8016: |-
    Will you help us?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course I will.
    Not right now.${prompt}
  8017: I knew you would! Many skilled beastmasters have gone, but none have returned. Maybe they've fallen to whatever is controlling the beasts!${prompt}
  8018: 'Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to protect yourself. Ask Osker in the stables in Upper Jeuno to help you.${prompt}'
  8019: You're the only one we can turn to! Please come back as soon as you can.${prompt}
  8020: 'So you''ve got ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Good work! You will know when to use it. Now, to the Eldieme Necropolis!${prompt}'
  8021: So that was what was happening. I'm happy that the honor of beastmasters has been cleared. On behalf of everyone here, I thank you.${prompt}
  8022: Pets are precious to beastmasters. I almost lost one, so I know how it feels. ${prompt}
  8023: The other night I dreamed I was riding my old chocobo across the plains. Brutus told me he'd let me see it again, and I can't wait!${prompt}
  8024: The other day I was finally able to ride my old chocobo... It was like, well, a dream come true. I never remembered riding to be so exciting.${prompt}
  8025: |-
    Ahhhhhh-choo!
    Excuse me. I think I caught myself a cold riding that old girl all night. My son's been taking care of me since morning.${prompt}
  8026: |-
    I don't know how to thank you for all you've done for me. I think I'll take me some of that great medicine you got for my son and get back into bed. Be seeing you!
    <Cough-cough!>${prompt}
  8027: Look at you, a true bard! Me? I think I've finally recovered from the pain of rejection.${prompt}
  8028: I couldn't bring myself to throw away the bracelet she gave me, but maybe now is the time.${prompt}
  8029: It breaks my heart to cast it away! Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt}
  8030: I can't throw away the bracelet she gave me. Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt}
  8031: |-
    Could you throw it away for me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oh, I suppose.
    No, do it yourself.${prompt}
  8032: Thank you! But this gift is too precious to toss into the garbage... I know! Could you cast it into the Waters of Oblivion at Ranguemont Pass?${prompt}
  8033: Good luck, and don't just dump it at some auction house, all right?${prompt}
  8034: Hmm... Maybe you're right. But I don't think I can bring myself to do it!${prompt}
  8035: It's too precious to throw into the garbage. No, it needs a more peaceful resting place, like the Water of Oblivion in Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8036: You threw it in? Thank you! My heart feels at peace, knowing that my ordeal is behind me. Please, take this in thanks.${prompt}
  8037: Perhaps everything is as full of memories as that bracelet... Should someone find it a hundred years hence, what shall they feel?${prompt}
  8038: Yes, maybe such feelings do not diminish with the flow of time. Oh, what a moving thought!${prompt}
  8039: Perhaps my heartfelt pain will live on in my song. Such is the life of a bard!${prompt}
  8040: Say, I see you're quite a bard now. I'm looking for a bard, you see...${prompt}
  8041: I thought you'd be a perfect match for this task. What do you say?${prompt}
  8042: |-
    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    You bet.
    Spare me.${prompt}
  8043: Thank goodness! Listen, it's such an onerous task that nobody wants to do it. I'm so lucky you're here!${prompt}
  8044: 'Well, for starters, you''ll need to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Can''t do much without one.${prompt}'
  8045: Oh, you're busy, huh? Well, who am I supposed to ask now? Bards like you don't exactly grow on trees, you know!${prompt}
  8046: Say, how about that task I told you about?${prompt}
  8047: Good, this will do nicely. Now for the task! I want you to visit the grave of a great bard of yesteryear and pray for him.${prompt}
  8048: Why, you ask? I don't know; it's just something we always do. They say he met a tragic end. Go ask other bards if you want to learn about him.${prompt}
  8049: His stone sarcophagus is deep inside the Eldieme Necropolis. It's one of several, and I can't remember which. Well, you'll find it.${prompt}
  8050: 'A little investigation will reveal which one is his. Purify it with that ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem. You don''t know the tune? It''s okay, just go!${prompt}'
  8051: Huh? The bard interred inside Eldieme? Yeah, he was executed in San d'Oria for committing a serious crime!${prompt}
  8052: So you're off to pray at his grave, huh? Be careful! You never know what evil lurks in those halls!${prompt}
  8053: 'Oh, did you take the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem? The task isn''t complete until you''ve done both!${prompt}'
  8054: Good work, ${name-player}! Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you about the monsters. Otherwise nobody would go! Understand?${prompt}
  8055: Huh? After that a man came and gave you a ring? I hope he wasn't a grave robber!${prompt}
  8056: But don't give that ring to me; I hate antiques. Anyway, here's your reward. Thanks again!${prompt}
  8057: Well, that's out of the way. Now who should I ask for the next task? Bards can be so selfish sometimes!${prompt}
  8058: So, what did you do with that ring? Maybe it's valuable. I'd ask a collector if I were you. Of course, he might just say it's worthless...${prompt}
  8059: You have emerged as a hero to the people of Jeuno. Just the sound of your name strikes courage into their hearts.${prompt}
  8060: As a representative of its citizens, I humbly ask you to continue your efforts for the good of the Duchy.${prompt}
  8061: 'Good luck, ${choice: 0}[citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation''s Signet.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8062: I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.${prompt}
  8063: |-
    I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1.
    I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.${prompt}

    I am sorry.

  8068: Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.${prompt}
  8069: |-
    Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly.
    I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.${prompt}
  8070: You've earned conquest points!${prompt}
  8071: |-
    You've received your nation's Signet.
    You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!${prompt}

    I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F.
    I want to go on a supplies quest.
    I have some questions...
    Nothing, sorry to bother you.${prompt}
  8076: |-
    What do you wish to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    Conquests.
    Conquest results.
    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8077: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8078: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8079: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8080: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8081: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8082: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8083: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8084: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8085: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8086: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  8087: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8088: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8089: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8090: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8091: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  8092: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8093: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8094: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8095: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8096: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8097: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8098: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8099: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8100: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8101: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8102: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8103: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8104: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8105: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8106: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

  8411: But wait, there's more. I've heard that Wolfgang took Verena to Delkfutt's Tower. You're coming, right, Aldo?${prompt}
  8412: I'll be ready in the blink of an eye. Somebody's going to be sorry they ever laid a finger on her!${prompt}
  8413: And that's the story.${prompt}
  8414: |-
    This is the last time I'll be made a fool of by that Kam'lanaut. If he lays a finger on Verena...
    The last time I was this angry, I...${prompt}

  8416: Me? I'm fine, but Verena's been unconscious since we returned. Come with me.${prompt}
  8417: From what I see, her mind's been poisoned. I never knew that Eald'narche had that kind of power...${prompt}
  8418: Now that you mention it, I hardly know anything about him.${prompt}
  8419: I guess I never really thought that I needed to know. If I got what I wanted, I was happy.${prompt}

    Verena!
    Do you know who I am, Verena?${prompt}

  8423: So, do you...do you remember what happened in the Stellar Fulcrum?${prompt}
  8424: Not really... It was all like watching a play...${prompt}
  8425: I see...${prompt}
  8426: I was controlled by the...the Shadow Lord's sheer will...${prompt}
  8427: You don't have to say any more. It's all over now. And I thank the heavens that you're back here safe with me.${prompt}
  8428: Aldo...${prompt}
  8429: I appreciate you traveling here, ${name-player}. However, I don't know if I can carry on this game with Eald'narche anymore.${prompt}

  8431: |-
    What should I...
    If we don't act quickly...${prompt}
  8432: Aah! I don't know if I can carry on this game with Eald'narche anymore.${prompt}
  8433: Uncle Aldo!${prompt}

  8435: |-
    Fickie's...Fickie's seeds...
    They've sprouty-wouted!${prompt}

  8437: C'mon! We'll show you!${prompt}
  8438: Looky-looky! You can't see it, but there's a sprouty-wouty under the soil! It's really-willy growing!${prompt}
  8439: The seed we planted--the seed we and Fickie planted--is growing!${prompt}
  8440: Well, I'll be...${prompt}
  8441: Aldo...${prompt}
  8442: Verena. The seed you planted with Fickblix has begun to sprout. These kids must have taken real good care of it.${prompt}
  8443: What you and Fickblix tried to do...maybe it wasn't all a lost cause.${prompt}
  8444: |-
    I'm so sorry, Fickblix...
    I've been caught up in my own troubles recently, and haven't come to check on these seeds.${prompt}
  8445: It sprouted! I knew that if everybody pitched in, it would grow.${prompt}
  8446: Fickblix... But...how?${prompt}
  8447: It's still just a sprout, but I know it'll bloom someday. I wish I could water it and feed it, too...${prompt}
  8448: '...${prompt}'
  8449: But if everybody keeps working hard, it will bloom. It will!${prompt}
  8450: Yes, Fickblix. It will bloom. We will make sure that it does.${prompt}
  8451: Well, I've got to go now, but I'm not sad anymore. What is that phrase you taught me, Verena?${prompt}
  8452: Yeah, “thank you.” That's the first phrase you taught me when I came here.${prompt}
  8453: We beastmen don't have a word for “thank you,” but I like that phrase a lot. I wanted to teach it to all my beastmen friends...${prompt}
  8454: Thank you, everybody...${prompt}

  8459: You just wait, Eald'narche! I'm not going to let you stand in our way!${prompt}
  8460: Hold up there, ${name-player}. Where's Aldo? You didn't just leave him on that cursed island to die, did you?${prompt}
  8461: If anything has happened to our boss, don't even think you'll be leaving here alive!${prompt}
  8462: What's with the long faces? You guys look like you just got back from a funeral!${prompt}
  8463: Boss!${prompt}
  8464: You're...still alive!${prompt}
  8465: Did you really think that I, the great Aldo, would flop at the hands of a couple worms like those Zilart?${prompt}
  8466: It wasn't easy, but thanks to ${name-player} here, the princes were no match for us!${prompt}
  8467: Thanks again, ${name-player}. You did really well up there.${prompt}

    The first time you came through my doors, you were nothing but a little punk.

  8479: No!${prompt}
  8480: She can't be... She just can't be gone! What did she do to deserve this!?${prompt}
  8481: |-
    Verena....
    Lion fought bravely that day. Her sacrifice saved millions of lives.${prompt}
  8482: So what!? Nothing we say can bring her back! She's...${prompt}
  8483: Why does everyone have to suffer!? What did Lion--what did Fickblix do to deserve their pain? I don't want to forget what they went through...${prompt}
  8484: I'm sorry, Verena.${prompt}
  8485: '...?${prompt}'
  8486: I-I can feel something... This warmth... Lion? Is that you?${prompt}
  8487: It is you, isn't it...${prompt}
  8488: Aldo, Lion is still alive. I can feel it. She's weaker than before, but she's still with us.${prompt}
  8489: You may be right, Verena. And if there's any shred of hope, the least we can do is continue to believe.${prompt}
  8490: So, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8491: As much as I'd love you to join us here at the Tenshodo, I think I already know your answer to that offer. But if you're ever in the neighborhood, be sure to drop by. You're always welcome.${prompt}
  8492: |-
    Well, I think it's time I took that vacation I've been promising myself. You should go someplace quiet and get some rest as well.
    I have a feeling that the real adventure has just begun...${prompt}
  8493: A lot has happened in the past few months... I don't know how long the news of the archduke and his brother is going to stay a secret, but that has nothing to do with me or the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8494: |-
    What to do now? Maybe I'll get myself a boat and sail around Vana'diel...
    Good luck on your journeys, ${name-player}, and may fortune smile upon you always!${prompt}

  8534: Would you control yourself, Kurou! This is my hair stylist, Runga-Kopunga. He's been telling me these past few days that I should get my hair done.${prompt}
  8535: I've been trying my best to convince her to let me work my mastery, but she just keeps dissy-dissing me. I envy that buddy-buddy of hers...${prompt}
  8536: Her buddy-buddy?${prompt}
  8537: Yeah. When they were still little kiddos, somebody told her that he liked her hairstyle--and she hasn't changed it since. I just want to talk to that square and ask him if he could convince Chululu here to let me work my magic on her.${prompt}

    Hmmm...

  8624: You must be extremely confident or extremely stupid to stroll back into Jeuno like this, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8625: |-
    We just received final authorization from your home nation.
    You are under arrest. The charge is treason.${prompt}
  8626: How's a man supposed to sit back and enjoy a nice glass of Opo-opo brew with all this commotion? Now is someone going to tell me what is going on here?${prompt}
  8627: Aldo, I apologize for my sudden intrusion. We are not here to cause any trouble for your business. We have only come to escort this criminal back to the palace.${prompt}
  8628: Criminal?${prompt}
  8629: Ah! It's the dead ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]!${prompt}
  8630: Hey! It's me! Don't you remember...
  8631: Whoa!
  8632: |-
    Wolfgang, Wolfgang, Wolfgang...
    Take a look around you. Does this look like a courthouse? This is my home, and all those in my home are my guests. You wouldn't be calling my guests criminals, now, would you?${prompt}
  8633: Aldo, this adventurer is not just some petty thief. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is suspected of committing treason against the Duchy. If you are thinking of harboring this menace to society, the Ducal Guard will be forced to take action.${prompt}
  8634: Action? If you want to see some action, just try laying a finger on one of my guests.${prompt}
  8635: |-
    Hmph... You never change, Aldo.
    Adventurer! If you know what's good for you, you'll come to the Grand Palace and turn yourself in once you're finished here.${prompt}
  8636: And don't even think about running. The warrant for your arrest has already been sent out across Vana'diel. There's nowhere to hide, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8637: Wow, so you are a criminal. Let me guess, they dumped you on Tavnazia as part of your punishment, right?${prompt}
  8638: So what did you do? Robbery? Murder? Both...?${prompt}
  8639: I see you two know each other.${prompt}
  8640: Yeah. This shabby-looking adventurer washed up dead on my private beach. I helped bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] back to life.${prompt}
  8641: |-
    Hey, wait a minute.
    Aldo, why not ask this ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]? ${choice-player-gender}[He'll/She'll] tell you I'm not a liar.${prompt}
  8642: |-
    Alright.
    ${name-player}, is it true that a small group of survivors has been living on the southern tip of Tavnazia for the past twenty years?${prompt}
  8643: |-
    　
    　
    　
    　${prompt}
  8644: See! Now do you believe me?${prompt}
  8645: This thickheaded buffoon wouldn't listen to a word I had to say!${prompt}
  8646: Hah! Some strange girl comes breaking down my door, screaming the name of my father, Altana rest his soul--what was I supposed to do?${prompt}
  8647: |-
    What were you supposed to do? What was I supposed to do?
    The only person I could trust--hell, the only person I knew on the mainland--was Grezzo.${prompt}
  8648: He told me that any time I was in trouble, he and the Tenshodo would help me out.${prompt}
  8649: But now he's gone and...${prompt}
  8650: Oh well, you'll still get us a boat so we can go home, right?${prompt}
  8651: Hmmm... That's not going to be as easy as it sounds. I still have nautical maps charting the way to the Sealion's Den, but they're outdated. The currents in that area have changed a lot over the past twenty years...${prompt}
  8652: It would take one hell of a navigator to make it to Tavnazia in one piece. But then again, I only employ the best of the best.${prompt}
  8653: |-
    You may be in luck.
    Just a few days ago, another customer came to me asking to take him to Tavnazia. I was ready to tell him no as well...until I saw the bag of gil he was offering.${prompt}
  8654: Another customer? Why would anyone else want to go to Tavnazia?${prompt}
  8655: |-
    I don't know. I'm not in the business of asking questions, young lady. As long as I get paid, I could care less what he does over there.
    And I don't care if you tag along, but that's not for me to decide. You'll have to get the customer's permission.${prompt}
  8656: Oh well. As much as I was looking forward to a private cruise, I guess I can't complain.${prompt}
  8657: How thoughtful...${prompt}
  8658: And you, ${name-player}. Why don't you go back to Tavnazia as well? You could lay low there for a while until Wolfgang's cooled off.${prompt}
  8659: |-
    No way!
    ${name-player}! If you're a real ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], you'll march your butt up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes!${prompt}
  8660: |-
    Tough on everyone but yourself, I see...
    Very well. It will take some time to prepare the ship. I will send a messenger when everything is ready. Until then, why don't you take a look around the city?${prompt}
  8661: Got it. Thanks, Aldo.${prompt}
  8662: Alright! Now it's time to have some fun!${prompt}
  8663: See ya, ${name-player}! Maybe we can get together again sometime...if you're still alive!${prompt}
  8664: Well, it looks like you should probably turn yourself in. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt}
  8665: It looks like you should probably turn yourself in, ${name-player}. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt}
  8666: ${name-player}, you weren't thinking of running now, were you? If you know what's good for you, you'll head on up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes.${prompt}
  8667: Ah, ${name-player}. Just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I wanted to see.${prompt}
  8668: A young lady claiming to be Prishe's acquaintance is here...${prompt}
  8669: ${name-player}! It is so nice to see you again. Have you not seen Prishe about?${prompt}
  8670: Hm? You are searching for her as well?${prompt}
  8671: |-
    I see...
    You wish to know more of the magicite gem that a peddler from Tavnazia sold to Bastok over thirty years ago...${prompt}
  8672: I do recall hearing stories of the “Star of Tavnazia”; unfortunately, I never actually set my eyes upon it. I do not know what it is, or if the magicite was a piece of it.${prompt}
  8673: |-
    Magicite...
    The Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  8674: |-
    ?
    Sir Aldo? You would not happen to know anything of the gem, would you?${prompt}
  8675: I've heard stories of a mysterious gem kept in the Tavnazian Cathedral. If that relic is also magicite, I wonder in what way it's connected with the other magicite found around Vana'diel...${prompt}
  8676: Deep within the Orc, Quadav, and Yagudo strongholds, there are doors that the beastmen guard with their lives. Beyond those doors lie giant crystals emitting a strange, eerie light.${prompt}
  8677: If the beastmen were drawn to these crystals and chose those areas to build their towns, then the magicite in the Northlands is more than likely... Hmmm...${prompt}
  8678: Perhaps someone in Tavnazia knows something. However, we cannot leave without Prishe. Oh, where could she have wandered off to?${prompt}
  8679: |-
    Leader!
    That girl! She's been taken to Doctor Monberaux's!${prompt}
  8680: |-
    What!?
    What happened!?${prompt}
  8681: It seems that she was attacked while visiting the Temple of the Goddess!${prompt}
  8682: Attacked!?${prompt}
  8683: Prishe!
  8684: |-
    They say some Elvaan girl was attacked while in the Temple of the Goddess--right in front of the statue of Altana!
    What is this city coming to!?${prompt}
  8685: |-
    Huh? You think it was a Tenshodo member that did the dirty deed!?
    ${name-player}, you'd better watch your tongue unless you want to see it on a plate!${prompt}
  8686: That blue-haired girl was taken to Monberaux's after the attack. I'm pretty sure she'll be all right, though. Doctor M. is the best medic in town.${prompt}
  8687: You don't need to worry, ${name-player}. Our city's fine doctor is taking care of Prishe as we speak.${prompt}
  8688: And as for the fiends that would do something like this, I guarantee you my men and women will find them.${prompt}
  8689: If you're looking for Prishe, she and that rich boy Tenzen have already set sail for the Tavnazian Archipelago. You're following them, right?${prompt}
  8690: Sir, the airships are ready for departure.${prompt}
  8691: I will be traveling on a separate vessel. If “he” appears before I arrive, prevent him from escaping, but do not attack.${prompt}
  8692: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  8693: It is all working as planned. Now, I will finally retrieve what is mine.${prompt}
  8694: |-
    Hey there, pal.
    I just met the weirdest Elvaan kid.${prompt}
  8695: She didn't have a single gil on her, but she spent hours in the gem store mooning over the same piece of jewelry.${prompt}
  8696: Eventually, the beauties working behind the counter got tired of her antics and threw her out.${prompt}
  8697: I'd been watching the whole thing and had the rotten luck of meeting the girl's eyes when she left the store.${prompt}
  8698: She's been dogging me ever since.${prompt}
  8699: I don't know if it was female intuition or what, but somehow she figured out I have a thing for the three ladies in the gem store.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    ...
    So, which one's my favorite out of the three?${prompt}
  8701: At first I thought the classical beauty on the left was my type.${prompt}
  8702: But then I got to thinking older women are the way to go, like the lady on the right.${prompt}
  8703: |-
    And then, not long ago, the pure and innocent type in the middle actually said hello to me.
    Now I'm captivated by her charms.${prompt}
  8704: To be perfectly honest with you, any of those three ladies could make me a happy man.${prompt}
  8705: My plan is to confess my feelings to the one who likes me the most--the one least likely to turn me down.${prompt}
  8706: |-
    When I explained all this to the Elvaan girl, she almost split her sides in laughter.
    The little brat!${prompt}
  8707: 'She told me that if I talked to each of the ladies in turn while holding ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I would know which of them had feelings for me.${prompt}'
  8708: 'But I''ve never even heard of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, let alone seen one.${prompt}'
  8709: Even an adventurer like you wouldn't have a clue where to get a gem like that, would you?${prompt}
  8710: |-
    Any clue about ${item-plural: 1[2]}?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have a pretty good idea.
    Never heard of them.${prompt}
  8711: |-
    No clue, right?
    I think that kid's just stringing me along for a laugh.${prompt}
  8712: |-
    You serious?
    Are you sure you're not just making fun of my feelings, like that Elvaan kid?${prompt}
  8713: |-
    Grrr!
    Just thinking about the smirk on that brat's face...${prompt}
  8714: 'Could I really find out which of those beauties had feelings for me if I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8715: "Nah, things are never that easy. \nThat Elvaan brat is just making fun of me.${prompt}"
  8716: 'Is that really...${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!?${prompt}'
  8717: |-
    I can't believe that kid was telling the truth.
    Well, I'll be damned.${prompt}
  8718: |-
    There's no time to lose.
    I gotta get in there and find the girl of my dreams!${prompt}
  8719: |-
    You ready?
    I'm going in!${prompt}
  8720: I'm looking to buy a necklace...${prompt}
  8721: |-
    Of course, sir!
    Is it a gift for someone special?${prompt}
  8722: Um, yeah...could be...${prompt}
  8723: We have a great selection for you to choose from! Just a moment, sir!${prompt}
  8724: Man, my hands won't stop sweating.${prompt}
  8725: 'So how''s this ${item-singular: 1[2]} supposed to work?${prompt}'
  8726: |-
    Whoa!
    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} changed color!
    Is this what she meant!?${prompt}
  8727: 'This ${item-singular: 1[2]} is one fantastic gem!${prompt}'
  8728: You wandered off before things got interesting, but you shoulda seen the sparks of romance fly between me and Adelflete.${prompt}
  8729: My mind is made up!${prompt}
  8730: |-
    It's more than just knowing that she likes me.
    Now I realize just how much I liked her!${prompt}
  8731: You say you've seen it all before?${prompt}
  8732: |-
    Hahaha!
    Looks like someone has a small case of jealousy.${prompt}
  8733: Well, here's a little present from the happiest man in the world to help cheer you up.${prompt}
  8734: |-
    Hahaha!
    Don't look so glum. The world's full of possibilities, even for you!${prompt}
  8735: |-
    Hahaha!
    I'm sorry, but one look at your face tells the whole story.
    Seeing me with my new girl reminds you of how unlucky you are, right?${prompt}
  8736: |-
    Don't worry, pal! The world's full of possibilities!
    Hahaha!${prompt}
  8737: The customer Adelflete just served--isn't he the man who's always loitering outside the store?${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Did you happen to see the gem he was holding?
    It's a rare stone that changes color depending on the temperature.${prompt}
  8739: |-
    Ah yes, I've seen one before.
    When the person holding it becomes hot and flustered, the hue of the gem changes.${prompt}
  8740: I've heard that it's used in other countries to measure the intensity of a person's feelings.${prompt}
  8741: Which would mean that he's quite taken by our Adelflete, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  8742: |-
    I was wondering who he was after for quite a while now.
    Now we know.${prompt}
  8743: |-
    I can't wait to see what happens.
    It's just like having one of those romantic plays right inside the store!${prompt}
  8744: |-
    What, you want to explore the towers of Pso'Xja?
    That shouldn't be a problem. We recently opened those ruins to all explorers.${prompt}
  8745: However, the Tenshodo is currently conducting an investigation on the deeper areas of the central tower, and we can't have pesky adventurers running around getting in our way.${prompt}
  8746: Though...if you were to scratch our backs, we wouldn't have any problems scratching yours.${prompt}
  8747: It just happens that the Tenshodo is searching for a certain jewel that is very popular in the Near Eastern countries.${prompt}
  8748: What kind of gem is it? Hmmm... Well, they're thin, hexagonally shaped, and come in rare colors like carmine and cyan. I heard that rich people like to decorate their turbans with them.${prompt}
  8749: They even say that sometimes a strange light shoots from their centers, though I've never seen it happen.${prompt}
  8750: Luckily for you, we've been finding a lot of those jewels in the other towers of Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  8751: Unfortunately, some strange device in that place seems to weaken even the strongest of our members. That's where you come in.${prompt}
  8752: Now, if you were to find one of those and bring it back to me, I'm pretty sure I could convince the boss to allow you access to the central tower.${prompt}
  8753: If you want to have access to the deeper parts of Pso'Xja, bring me a jewel from the ruins and I'll see what I can do.${prompt}
  8754: |-
    Hmmm...
    This looks a lot like what we're dealing in, but the color just isn't right. We want something a little more “exotic” than the regular colored gems.${prompt}
  8755: |-
    Well, what do you know?
    This is exactly what we've been looking for.${prompt}
  8756: You know, you're not a bad treasure hunter. Did you ever think of joining the Tenshodo?${prompt}
  8757: |-
    Ah, but you'd probably get bored really quick.
    Anyway, take this pass. It will give you access to the more “sensitive” areas of the ruins.${prompt}
  8758: But I'll warn you one last time--the central tower ruins are still under investigation.${prompt}
  8759: Don't expect any search parties if you happen to get lost.${prompt}
  8760: |-
    Bienvenue à Neptune's Spire !
    Hm ? Oh, je me souviens de vous. Vous êtes celui/celle qui nous a apporté ce joyau de Pso'Xja.

    Quoi qu'il en soit, à propos de ces joyaux de Pso'Xja...${prompt}
  8765: Il semblerait que ces joyaux ne soient pas juste des roches tombées d'un trou dans une montagne.${prompt}
  8766: 'Grâce aux aventuriers comme vous, nous avons appris qu’il existe trois types : gris, cyan et carmin - et ils renferment tous une sorte d’énergie étrange qui n’est trouvée nulle part ailleurs sur Vana’diel.${prompt}'
  8767: De plus, nous avons récemment reçu des rapports de nos collègues à Bastok indiquant que le chef ingénieur républicain, Cid, collectait les joyaux.${prompt}
  8768: Maintenant, si nous pouvions découvrir quelle puissance ces éclats détiennent vraiment, le Tenshodo pourrait faire une fortune !${prompt}

  8818: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8819: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8820: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8821: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8822: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8823: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8824: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8825: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8826: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8827: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8828: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8829: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8830: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8831: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8832: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8833: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8834: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8835: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8836: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8837: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8838: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8839: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8840: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8841: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8842: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8843: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8844: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8845: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8846: 'You find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} hidden within the streetlamp and place it in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  8847: You should be careful in a big city like Jeuno; there are always people ready to take advantage of your naiveté.${prompt}

    It is time to put my research to the test!
    Bwahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9146: |-
    This tome--“The Lost Looking Glass”--is a collection of research notes written by Taliesin, and organized into a book by one of his friends.
    I had a devil-wevil of a time finding it.${prompt}
  9147: Taliesin fell victim to a deadly illness before he managed to finish his research.${prompt}
  9148: |-
    I bet he was really peevy-weeved to leave things undone like that.
    I'm something of a researcher myself, so I can imagine the frustration.${prompt}
  9149: |-
    Maybe the desire to continue his work has cursed him to wander the world as a ghost!
    I justaru love horror stories...${prompt}
  9150: |-
    Ahem. Anyway, there are many passages on the Glass of Blessed Radiance in here.
    It truly was a beautiful piece...${prompt}
  9151: During that incident in Jugner Forest, a blinding light poured out from the mirror to envelop everything in an incandescent glow.${prompt}
  9152: Could that light have been...?${prompt}
  9153: That light...?${prompt}
  9154: Justaru like the glow of the Glass of Blessed Radiance was described in Taliesin's notes!${prompt}
  9155: |-
    But how could this be?
    Its power is meantaru to be sealed within a lake of ice--a place in the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier known as “Mirror Pond.”${prompt}
  9156: There is a tale that says the seal is protected by the spirit of a mirror guardian.${prompt}
  9157: 'If you burn ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} on top of a slab of ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} by the shores of the lake, the spirit is supposed to become visible.${prompt}'
  9158: 'To gather-wather these items, you need a few different tools: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9159: I wanted to try it myself as partaru of my research, but there were too many nasty-wasties roaming the area.${prompt}
  9160: Hmm...${prompt}
  9161: So. How about you find this pond of ice and have a chat with the resident spirit about the Glass of All-Seeing?${prompt}
  9162: The spirit of a guardian...?${prompt}
  9163: Spirit, you say...?${prompt}
  9164: A guardian spirit...${prompt}
  9165: The spirit of a mirror guardian...?${prompt}

  9272: And that's why I want to continue our adventures together.${prompt}
  9273: Our partnership has been the greatest treasure I've ever found...${prompt}

  9287: To tell the truth, I doubted the powers of the mirror at first.${prompt}
  9288: But after listening to Palometa's story, I was glad that I trusted in the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9289: Looking back, these past events have been just the kind of excitement I needed.${prompt}
  9290: The mirror is a great treasure--that's for sure!${prompt}
  9291: But I value the friendship we've made even more!${prompt}
  9292: You hold on to that pearl, you hear me, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  9293: I felt a strange power within the Glass of All-Seeing from the first moment I picked it up.${prompt}

  9308: The power I felt was a premonition of the brewing storm.${prompt}
  9309: Looking back, that story was almost prophetic.${prompt}

  9324: I wonder if the guiding power of the mirror was born from these people's thoughts.${prompt}
  9325: What could they possibly be trying to lead us to?${prompt}
  9326: In any event, the Glass of All-Seeing has taken me on an amazing journey.${prompt}

  9434: The Glass of All-Seeing is the thing that brought us together.${prompt}
  9435: But if the true force guiding me was the connection between the two mirrors...${prompt}
  9436: '...Then the end of my journey was Palometa.${prompt}'
  9437: I couldn't believe it when we learned she was gonna be the guardian of her father's mirror.${prompt}
  9438: I felt a little sad as well.${prompt}
  9439: But even though you're not the person I was fated to meet, you're still an irreplaceable part of my life.${prompt}
  9440: So, listen up!${prompt}
  9441: I want us to keep on adventuring together.${prompt}
  9442: Our meeting may have been pure chance...${prompt}
  9443: But I'm glad you were there at the end of my path.${prompt}
  9444: And nothing is ever gonna change that!${prompt}
  9445: I have been thinking about the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9446: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa recited?${prompt}
  9447: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9448: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9449: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}

  9454: Personally, I believe this tale to be an abstract description of how new things are born when people come together.${prompt}
  9455: And when that new thing has the power to reach the heavens, it will truly be treasured.${prompt}
  9456: The Glass of All-Seeing was responsible for bringing us together.${prompt}

  9470: I interpret this to be a story about the greatness of chance meetings.${prompt}
  9471: |-
    There are chance meetings the value of which is comparable to the rarest of treasures.
    I think you'll agree.${prompt}
  9472: It was through the Glass of All-Seeing's power, not mere chance, that we were able to meet, you and I.${prompt}
  9473: Without the mirror's guidance, I daresay our paths may never have crossed.${prompt}
  9474: However, this in no way detracts from the importance I place in our friendship.${prompt}
  9475: I am grateful the mirror led us together, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9476: I thought you should know that.${prompt}

  9521: |-
    Eh bien, je dois dire que tu es encore plus intelligent que tu n'en as l'air.
    Tu es arrivé ici de la même manière, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9522: 'Dernièrement, les gens ont éparpillé des ${item-plural: 0[2]} comme s’il n’y avait pas de lendemain, donc beaucoup de membres du Tenshodo ne connaissent pas ce tour.${prompt}'

  9533: Tu sais que les navires à Mhaura transportaient autrefois des mercenaires potentiels vers le Proche-Orient ? Si tu veux monter à bord de l'un de ces navires, tu dois passer par le Tenshodo ici.${prompt}
  9534: Nous avons reçu une demande de l'Empire elle-même. Faire accoster ces navires était un véritable casse-tête. Nous avons finalement réussi à négocier un prix avantageux sur quelques vieux navires délabrés, et...${prompt}
  9535: Et tu t'en fiches. Désolé pour ça. Un homme doit parfois se défouler.${prompt}
  9536: Quoi qu'il en soit, tu devrais savoir maintenant comment les choses fonctionnent ici. Si tu veux quelque chose, tu dois d'abord m'apporter quelque chose que je veux.${prompt}
  9537: Si tu n'as pas envie de chercher ce que je veux, tu peux toujours donner des gils à la place. Bien sûr, ce serait plus rapide.${prompt}
  9538: Rendons cette explication brève, d'accord ?${prompt}
  9539: Tu vois, les prix sont un peu différents au Proche-Orient. Quelque chose qui se vend une gil la douzaine ici pourrait être un article de luxe à Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9540: |-
    Passons directement au but, maintenant.
    Je veux que tu m'apportes des articles courants de ce côté de Vana'diel, et je te donnerai ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} en échange.${prompt}

    La liste avancée, hein ? Un choix superbe. Les articles sur cette liste sont peu nombreux, donc ils devraient bien tenir dans ton sac, mais ils sont assez difficiles à trouver.
    Tu peux choisir parmi les suivants:${prompt}

  9550: Un “témoignage”. Ces vieux morceaux de papyrus semblent être très populaires auprès des collectionneurs ces jours-ci. Je ne connais pas tous les détails, mais apparemment, il existe un témoignage pour chacun des métiers d'un aventurier. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai juste besoin d'un seul.${prompt}
  9551: Ta dernière option est de m'apporter des fragments de Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  9552: 'J’aurai besoin d’un ensemble de ceux-ci, cependant. Tu devras m’apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, les trois.${prompt}'
  9553: |-
    C'est tout pour la liste avancée.

  9554: |-
    Intermédiaire, hein ?
    Celle-ci est assez ennuyeuse.${prompt}
  9555: Les hommes-bêtes ont été un vrai fléau pour le Proche-Orient ces derniers temps. Non pas que nous n'ayons pas eu de problèmes ici aussi.${prompt}
  9556: Mais quoi qu'il en soit, la situation a fait monter la demande pour les dépouilles des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  9557: 'Je veux que tu m’apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9558: Les hommes-bêtes les utilisent pour relayer des ordres. J’ai besoin des trois.${prompt}
  9559: |-
    C'est tout pour la liste intermédiaire.
    Cela peut sembler simple, mais ces objets sont dispersés dans tous les bastions et sont assez difficiles à obtenir.${prompt}
  9560: Tu dis vouloir aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu es trop lâche pour affronter un défi, hein ? Cette attitude ne te mènera nulle part dans l'Empire, je te le dis. Ah bien, c'est tout pareil pour moi, tant que je fais du profit.${prompt}
  9561: Ce sera plus comme des courses, mais il y a beaucoup de choses à collecter sur cette liste.${prompt}

    Êtes-vous arrivé à Aht Urhgan en un seul morceau ? Désolé de vous avoir pris par surprise plus tôt.${prompt}
  9589: Je ne suis pas sûr que vous le sachiez ou non, mais Aht Urhgan a un pacte interdisant aux aéronefs de survoler leur nation.${prompt}
  9590: Bien sûr, nous avons trouvé un moyen de contourner cela, et nous vous avons largué dans cette immense forêt depuis le ciel. Le Tenshodo vous donnera toujours votre argent en valeur.${prompt}
  9591: Nous ne voulions pas que quelqu'un d'autre connaisse cette route, alors nous avons dû vous secourir en plein vol et maintenir l'opération secrète. Désolé, mais c'était le seul moyen.${prompt}

  9614: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  9615: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  9616: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  9617: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  9618: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  9619: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  9620: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'
  9621: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  9622: Bring 'em to me and I'll make your bag bigger.${prompt}
  9623: Don't know where on Vana'diel you're going to find most of those goodies, but I'm bettin' a Greedalox the likes of yourself'll find a way.${prompt}

  9626: It was Archduke Kam'lanaut, among other Jeunoan dignitaries, who championed the idea of an alliance of nations.${prompt}

    Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm!
    Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!${prompt}
  9806: Use one of our state-of-the-art “Maze Tabulae” to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!${prompt}
  9807: Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!${prompt}
  9808: |-
    The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers.
    With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!${prompt}
  9809: |-
    So what are you waiting for?
    Let Moblin Maze Mongers build you the maze of your dreams--or nightmares--today!${prompt}
  9810: |-
    Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless!
    With three simple-to-use items--“Maze Tabulae,” “Maze Vouchers,” and “Maze Runes”--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.${prompt}
  9811: The first and most important of these items is the “Maze Tabula,” which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.${prompt}
  9812: Next you have the “Maze Voucher,” a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.${prompt}
  9813: |-
    After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications.
    However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.${prompt}
  9814: |-
    You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not!
    That's where “Maze Runes” come in.
    The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.${prompt}
  9815: |-
    Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects.
    Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!${prompt}
  9816: You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.${prompt}
  9817: |-
    Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes.
    Please manipulate your Maze Runes as necessary so that they do not touch any black squares.${prompt}
  9818: |-
    Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with.
    Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.${prompt}
  9819: |-
    The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula.
    Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.${prompt}
  9820: After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.${prompt}
  9821: Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!${prompt}
  9822: 'Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers'' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per ${choice: 0}[twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  9823: |-
    However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers.
    Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.${prompt}
  9824: This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!${prompt}
  9825: |-
    After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby.
    Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.${prompt}
  9826: |-
    During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities.
    You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.${prompt}
  9827: |-
    After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze.
    The challenge begins!${prompt}
  9828: "Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze. \nWhat myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!${prompt}"
  9829: |-
    After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze.
    You may do so by any one of the following methods:${prompt}
  9830: "”Leaving From the Exit”\nEach maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity. \nIf spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.${prompt}"
  9831: Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.${prompt}
  9832: |-
    “Using a ${item-singular: 0[2]}”
    A complimentary ${item-singular: 0[2]} will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze.
    Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.${prompt}
  9833: |-
    “Emergency Extraction”
    Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.${prompt}
  9834: |-
    Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze!
    Happy spelunking!${prompt}
  9835: Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.${prompt}
  9836: Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.${prompt}
  9837: |-
    Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze.
    Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.${prompt}
  9838: "Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels. \nNote, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.${prompt}"
  9839: |-
    We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties.
    While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.${prompt}
  9840: "Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work. \nPlease understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.${prompt}"
  9841: |-
    In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety.
    Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.${prompt}
  9842: In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called “Moblin Marbles” as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.${prompt}
  9843: These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!${prompt}
  9844: How about a nice, shiny one of these?${prompt}
  9845: Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?${prompt}
  9846: Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!${prompt}
  9847: |-
    And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits!
    These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.${prompt}
  9848: Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!${prompt}
  9849: |-
    There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now.
    Jus' come back here if ye need t'look at it again.${prompt}
  9850: |-
    Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye?${wait-36: 1}
    Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types.
    Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?${prompt}
  9851: |-
    Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers!
    We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!${prompt}
  9852: |-
    With great success, though, comes great responsibility!
    Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible.
    Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.${prompt}
  9853: |-
    At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first!
    How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound?
    Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!${prompt}
  9854: "Customers will receive their first C.C. point ${choice: 0}[thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every ${choice: 0}[eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter. \nA maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.${prompt}"
  9855: |-
    And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what!
    Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.${prompt}
  9856: |-
    Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze.
    Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.${prompt}
  9857: |-

  9937: Now, before-ethy I proceed, please be reminded that not a single word spoken here today must be allowed to leave-ethy this room.${prompt}
  9938: If what my investigation has revealed is true-ethy, we have a major crisis looming.${prompt}
  9939: A teleportation mishap-ethy has resulted in the creation of a clone-ethy of Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  9940: Wh-what? As if one Doctor Shantotto wasn't already a handful, now we have to contend with two!?${prompt}
  9941: Of all the Goddess-forsaken incidents...${prompt}
  9942: And to rub-ethy salt into the wound, the evil tendencies exhibited by the newly created clone are such-ethy that they put the original doctor to shame-ethy!${prompt}
  9943: |-
    “Domina Shantotto,” she has taken-ethy to calling herself, though this you may already know-ethy.
    Ever since her appearance-ethy, she hasn't wasted a second to enact her malicious machinations!${prompt}
  9944: Oh, my poor, tired head-ethy...${prompt}
  9945: |-
    If word-ethy gets out to the other nations, Windurst will become the laughingstock-ethy of the two continents!

    Had only I heeded Principal Koru-Moru's warnings...
    Oh, the Goddess strike-ethy me down for a fool!${prompt}
  9947: To avoid raising alarm bells, we've planted a life-size talking doll-ethy of the doctor at her abode and imbued it with a personality that's equally abrasive-ethy, but the people won't be fooled for long.${prompt}
  9948: We must act, and act fast-ethy, lest all of this becomes public knowledge and mass panic-ethy grips the land!${prompt}
  9949: Certainly not the kind of predicament you want to get dragged into should you wish to live to a ripe old age...
  9950: But as much as I'm loath to admit it, we--myself and all adventurers included--are already involved up to our necks.${prompt}
  9951: Whatever devious scheme that Domina Shantotto is plotting, it would be naive to assume that she has any less than the whole of Vana'diel in her sights.${prompt}
  9952: Now, I think it's safe to say that we're all agreed that action must be taken.${prompt}
  9953: But what should our first step be to avert this clear and present danger?${prompt}
  9954: Let me first tell-ethy you what else I know.${prompt}
  9955: Upon learning of the teleportation mishap-ethy, I sought to locate the whereabouts of the original-ethy Doctor Shantotto. I deduced that the clone-ethy might have had a hand in her disappearance.${prompt}
  9956: And sure-ethy enough, my sources have revealed that the original doctor is being held captive-ethy somewhere in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9957: I propose-ethy that our first act is the rescue of “Original Shantotto”--for the sake of convenience, let's call-ethy her by this moniker for the time being.${prompt}
  9958: 'Ah, I see where you''re going with this: fight fire with fire!${prompt}'
  9959: It sounds like our best bet. The odds would be greatly improved if we had the original Shantotto fighting on our side.${prompt}
  9960: ${name-player}, I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in this.${prompt}
  9961: Let's be on our way!${prompt}
  9962: I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in rescuing the original Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9963: According to Professor Yoran-Oran, the doctor is being held captive in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9964: “A perfect world order...${prompt}
  9965: '...that exists solely for our pleasure”!?${prompt}'

  9967: |-
    <Puff...wheeze...>
    Th-the doctor's location-ethy! I have it!${prompt}
  9968: As a last resort, I employed the services of Windurst's infamous Cat Burglar-ethy, Nanaa Mihgo, to locate Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9969: 'And true-ethy to her reputation, she''s successfully tracked down the doctor''s current hideout-ethy: the Sacrificial Chamber within the Temple of Uggalepih!${prompt}'
  9970: The only hitch-ethy is--and acquiring this piece of information further lightened my coin purse-ethy--ancient artifacts known as “Tablets of Hexes” are required for entry. They can supposedly be found-ethy scattered throughout the temple and deeper within.${prompt}
  9971: Ah, yes. The Cat Burglar has never been one to lose scent of her prey.${prompt}
  9972: So the next leg of our journey takes us to Elshimo Island...${prompt}
  9973: By means fair or foul, we must put an end to Shantotto's nefarious plot.${prompt}
  9974: Vana'diel must not be allowed to fall into such tyrannical hands!${prompt}

    But first, there are matters I must attend to in Jeuno.
    I must ensure that the Tenshodo isn't left leaderless should...should the worst come to pass.${prompt}

  9977: Very well-ethy. Let us rendezvous at the Sacrificial Chamber.
  9978: |-
    There are matters I must settle here first before departure.

  10046: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10047: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10048: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10049: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10050: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10051: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10052: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10053: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10054: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10055: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10056: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10057: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10058: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10059: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10060: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10061: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10062: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10063: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10064: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10065: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10066: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10067: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10068: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10069: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10070: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10071: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10072: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10073: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10074: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10075: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10076: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10077: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10078: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10079: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10080: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10081: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10082: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10083: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10084: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10085: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10086: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10087: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10088: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10089: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10090: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10091: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10092: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10093: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10094: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10095: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10096: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10097: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10098: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10099: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10100: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10101: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10102: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10103: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10104: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10105: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10106: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10107: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10108: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10109: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10110: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10111: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10112: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10113: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10114: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10115: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10116: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10117: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10118: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10119: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10120: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10121: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10122: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10123: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10124: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10125: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10126: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10127: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10128: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10129: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?

    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10150: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10151: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10152: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10153: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10154: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10155: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10156: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10157: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10158: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10159: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  10160: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!

    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.

    Il vaut mieux pour nous deux que vous gardiez vos possessions les plus précieuses à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}

    ${choice: 0}[////Mines de Palborough/////Canal de Toraimarai]${prompt}
  10273: Cette liste peut sembler intimidante, mais nous avons confiance en votre capacité à relever ce défi.${prompt}
  10274: Certains de ces repères sont situés près de l'entrée, tandis que d'autres sont plus profonds à l'intérieur.${prompt}
  10275: Je vous souhaite bonne chance dans cette entreprise.${prompt}
  10276: Le gouvernement de Jeuno a promulgué un système permettant aux aventuriers de pionniers des terres inexplorées.${prompt}
  10277: Ce système a été proposé par les dirigeants de la Ville Sacrée d'Adoulin, une capitale commerciale d'outre-mer dont le volume d'échanges rivalise avec celui de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10278: Les pionniers sont appelés à traverser les eaux de la Mer de Zafmlug, loin à l'ouest, et à aider à coloniser les terres sauvages d'Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10279: Lorsque cette proposition est parvenue à San d'Oria par diverses routes commerciales, elle a introduit Jeuno à l'idée, ce qui a conduit à sa mise en œuvre.${prompt}
  10280: Adoulin n'est pas un endroit pour les faibles ou les non-initiés. Des terres sauvages impitoyables entourent la ville, et les simples laïcs n'ont aucune chance de survie. C'est en raison de ces circonstances uniques qu'Adoulin a commencé à recruter des aventuriers hautement expérimentés pour l'aider à atteindre ses objectifs.${prompt}
  10281: Ici, au Bureau de Consultation, nous délivrons des permis permettant aux aventuriers proactifs de passer à Adoulin.${prompt}
  10282: Cependant, les néophytes ne peuvent pas fournir les services qu'Adoulin demande. En conséquence, la Chambre a commandé un test simple pour ceux qui souhaitent entreprendre le voyage périlleux.${prompt}
  10283: Ceux qui sont chevronnés dans le combat devraient trouver cela relativement indolore.${prompt}
  10284: 'Adoulin a préparé une multitude de ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, dont une sera remise à chaque aventurier cherchant à prouver sa valeur.${prompt}'
  10285: 'Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} sont accordés à la terre et sont capables d’enregistrer des repères situés à des emplacements spécifiques. Des détails supplémentaires seront fournis une fois que nous vous aurons délivré les certifications appropriées.${prompt}'
  10286: Pour l'instant, revenons à la tâche que vous aurez à affronter.${prompt}
  10287: Apportez cet objet avec vous et emmenez-le dans l'une des plusieurs zones réparties dans tout Vana'diel. Le choix de l'endroit que vous souhaitez explorer vous appartient.${prompt}
  10288: 'Il vous suffit de passer le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sur les marques situées dans la zone pour terminer votre mission.${prompt}'
  10289: 'Une fois cette tâche terminée, il vous suffit de nous rapporter le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ici et nous analyserons les résultats.${prompt}'
  10290: 'Si votre épreuve est menée à bien, vous serez considéré comme ayant réussi et vous recevrez ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ce qui vous permettra de voyager jusqu’à Adoulin.${prompt}'
  10291: Cela devrait constituer une explication suffisante. Si vous choisissez de passer le test, je vous souhaite la meilleure des chances.${prompt}
  10292: Comme vous vous en souviendrez peut-être, le test consiste à visiter l'un des différents donjons.${prompt}
  10293: Pour être tout à fait franc, nous avons reçu un grand nombre de signatures de la part du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers. Manifestement, avec tous les aventuriers qui vont et viennent, ils ont également besoin d'aide pour des activités non combatives.${prompt}
  10294: 'Compte tenu de cela, le comité a délibéré jour et nuit pour trouver une solution. À la suite de cette difficile délibération, une décision exécutive a été prise d’émettre des billets spéciaux au prix de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  10295: Le comité a fondé son jugement sur l'idée que l'accumulation de fonds est un autre signe d'un aventurier intrépide.${prompt}
  10296: Après tout, Adoulin est une ville de commerce maritime, tout comme notre bien-aimée Jeuno. Nous reconnaissons qu'elle accueille les compétences commerciales sous toutes leurs formes, sans distinction de race ou de croyance.${prompt}

  10304: 'Il y a encore une chose. Prenez également ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec vous.${prompt}'
  10305: Cela vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin. Vous avez peut-être remarqué qu'il y a un portail mystique situé ici à Basse Jeuno. Celui-ci vous mènera là-bas.${prompt} 
  10306: 'Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} enregistrent des sources de puissance en des endroits spécifiques et permettent un voyage instantané entre deux lieux.${prompt}'
  10307: On m'a informé que cette forme de transport s'appelle le "warping".${prompt}
  10308: 'Le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai présenté est déjà accordé au lieu à Basse Jeuno et à l’ouest d’Adoulin.${prompt}'
  10309: Le faire passer sur la surface du portail vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin.${prompt}
  10310: Cependant, le Warping n'est pas gratuit ; le processus nécessite un certain type d'énergie.${prompt}
  10311: Selon mes informations, échanger des cristaux contre un waypoint les convertira en énergie. Ce processus s'appelle le "charging".${prompt}
  10312: 'L’énergie, appelée "unités cinétiques", est enregistrée sur le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai donné.${prompt}'
  10313: Utiliser les waypoints épuisera une partie de ces unités cinétiques à chaque fois, je recommande donc une recharge périodique.${prompt}
  10314: Il est indiqué ici que tout ce que je vous ai transmis peut être consulté à tout moment à partir de n'importe quel point de passage.${prompt}
  10315: Bien sûr, en considération de toute votre aide, celui que je vous ai donné est entièrement chargé. J'espère que vous en ferez bon usage.${prompt}
  10316: C'est toutes les informations que je peux vous fournir. Vos aventures à Adoulin dépendront de ce que vous en ferez, et nous espérons que vous apporterez une contribution positive au développement de la nation et au succès de l'initiative pionnière.${prompt}
  10317: Nos archives montrent que vous avez déjà déclaré votre désir de participer à l'initiative.${prompt}
  10318: 'Lorsque nous émettrons votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, nous collecterons votre ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Assurez-vous de choisir votre chemin judicieusement.${prompt}'

  10324: 'Votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est accordé non seulement à l’emplacement que vous avez visité, mais aussi à des emplacements à travers Adoulin.${prompt}'
  10325: 'Nous avons une tâche que nous aimerions demander à tous les aventuriers qui possèdent ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10326: Cette demande provient directement du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers, avec la récompense à être versée par eux également.${prompt}
  10327: 'Le contenu de cette demande est simple. L’Association veut que les aventuriers enregistrent des lieux de pouvoir pour eux en utilisant le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Bien sûr, ils sont conscients que différents aventuriers auront des envies et des priorités différentes.${prompt}'
  10328: 'Afin de soutenir les aventuriers dont les compétences sont mieux utilisées en dehors du champ de bataille, l’Association recherche des personnes pour accorder ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} à leur place.${prompt}'

  10468: Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}
  10469: Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt}
  10470: First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt}
  10471: The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt}
  10472: Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt}
  10473: If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt}
  10474: Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt}
  10475: For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt}
  10476: If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt}
  10477: Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt}
  10478: 'I suppose it''s still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you''re trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10479: 'The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt}'
  10480: 'Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt}'
  10481: 'That means the first three values are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}.${prompt}'
  10482: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10483: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 4}. However, since it exceeds 100, the value becomes ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10484: 'Putting all of these values together gives you ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}, which is your password to register your access privileges with the device.${prompt}'

  10662: They say that people's greatest fear is the fear of the unknown, which makes sense to me. Why else would my teeth start chattaruing every time I get objectives addressed to me with no sender?${prompt}
  10663: Anyway, that's why I'm so gracious-waciously giving this one to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10664: '...You are going to prove to me that you''re a truly valiantaru and brave adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  10665: |-
    Will you prove your worth?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, for no one questions my valor!
    Doing your dirty work won't prove a thing.${prompt}
  10666: Fine, then. I'm sure there are hordes of other adventurers chomping-womping at the bit to prove their worth.${prompt}
  10667: |-
    I knew you'd be back.
    So, are you ready to prove-wove yourself in Records of Eminence?${prompt}
  10668: You adventurers can never abide affrontarus to your character, can you?${prompt}
  10669: Either way, your objective is to investigate various telepoints. Yeesh, this task is so far beneath a white mage of my caliber-waliber, it isn't even funny.${prompt}
  10670: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's not beneath me.
    Teleport me to them, then.${prompt}
  10671: |-
    Teleportaru you!?
    Bite me!${prompt}
  10672: You've just insulted every hardworking mage everywhere. You need to work for your share, not leech-weech off the kindness of strangers.${prompt}
  10673: |-
    Excellentaru.
    Just remember to procure gate crystals along the way, lest you look like a fool.${prompt}
  10674: |-
    Perfectaru.
    It shouldn't give you much trouble, either, as long as you know the spell Teleport.${prompt}
  10675: Alright, I'll see you once you've completarued your objective.${prompt}
  10676: Your mission, should you choose to remember-wember it, is to investigate the various telepoints scattered throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10677: |-

    I guess that means you've got ${choice: 6}[/one/two/three/four/five] to go.${prompt}
  10678: '...Not the ripest pamama in the bunch, I see. You haven''t investigated a single-wingle one!${prompt}'
  10679: I honestly didn't expectaru you to return with such haste.${prompt}
  10680: Oh...no...${prompt}
  10681: Don't you dare move a finger-winger, or I'll bite you harder than a poison leech!${prompt}
  10682: That was Ervie...I mean Ervok.${prompt}
  10683: He's my friend, but we haven't adventured together in so long. We've driftarued so far apart that the gap between us is impossible to cross.${prompt}
  10684: But now I hear he started teaching-weaching people about Records of Eminence!${prompt}
  10685: He even stopped using his real name. Now he goes by the moniker-woniker “Eternal Flame” or something dumb.${prompt}
  10686: Back in the old days, the five of us always used to venture forth into the unknown and combataru the forces of evil whenever we got the chance.${prompt}
  10687: I still remember how the auction house was always packed, so we'd meet in frontaru of the tavern.${prompt}
  10688: Beam me up, Toto!${prompt}
  10689: How many times have I told-wold you to stop calling me that!?${prompt}
  10690: I am constantly in your debt, Nantoto. Without your superb knowledge of the healing arts, I would never be able to effectively perform as a paladin.${prompt}
  10691: I agree! You've got more fighting spirit in your pinky toe than I have in my whole being!${prompt}
  10692: Wait, is fighting spirit really necessary when casting magic? I was under the impression that all you need...is love.${prompt}
  10693: Yeah, yeah, quit with the non sequitarus already. So, where do you want me to take you?${prompt}
  10694: Hmmm, where do I want to wrrreak havoc today...${prompt}
  10695: It's not that I hate the spell Teleport. On the contrary, I felt like I was serving a greater purpose-wurpose whenever I used it.${prompt}
  10696: I'll never forgetaru the memories of all I did with my friends back then. Countless sunsets have been swallowed by the ocean since I enjoyed using Teleport, but while I may not remember how many sunsets the seas have claimed, those memories are still as vivid as the bluest of skies.${prompt}
  10697: '...Although they may not mean much now that our friendship has darkened more than the setting sun.${prompt}'
  10698: |-
    C...can I confide something to you?
    ...There's another reason-weason I handed over that objective.${prompt}
  10699: You might not know this, but...one is the loneliest number to teleportaru.${prompt}
  10700: |-
    Ugh, forget I said anything!
    It was all an elaborataru lie! Don't listen to my misguided ramblings!${prompt}

    Here.
    Now get out of my sightaru!${prompt}

    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}.
    So, how's your inquestaru coming along?${prompt}

    <Sniffle>
    I want to ask Rolandienne and the others a favor-wavor, but...${prompt}
  10705: '...What if they rejectaru my offer?${prompt}'
  10706: I just know they will, and I'll be devastatarued. Oh, my Goddess, I can feel myself getting depressed just thinking about it.${prompt}
  10707: <Sigh>...${prompt}
  10708: What timing-wiming you have, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10709: Another one of those strange and horrible-worrible objectives showed up in my name!${prompt}
  10710: |-
    I don't getaru it at all.
    Why won't they leave me alone!?${prompt}
  10711: Moreover, it's a real doozy-woozy. How can a delicataru little flower like me possibly be asked to slay nasty shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis!?${prompt}
  10712: You know what? I refuse-wuse to undertake any of these until the person in charge shows himself!${prompt}
  10713: '...So, ${name-player}, my friend of friends. My buddy of buddies...how about acceptaruing this objective in my stead?${prompt}'

    ${selection-lines}
    I'd love to help.
    ...Delicate little flower?
    No, thanks.${prompt}

    Hmph!
    With that attitude, I'd be surprise-wised if you die ever having known the touch of a ${choice-player-gender}[woman/man].${prompt}
  10716: So, have you finally caved in and decided to eradicataru those shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt}
  10717: Thanks for letting me know you're a misogynistaru.${choice-player-gender}[/ It must be such a burden to loathe your own kind.]${prompt}
  10718: Not scared of combat in the least, are you? Well, that's precisely the quality I'm looking for in my surrogataru.${prompt}
  10719: I give you permission to go completely berserk-werk over any opponent you find, so don't disappoint me.${prompt}
  10720: How does it feel to be the grim reaper-weaper of shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt}
  10721: Don't be such a frrraidy cat, Toto. Come on, let's just go!${prompt}
  10722: When I say “No,” I explicitaruly mean no!${prompt}
  10723: Would a polite appeal from me, in addition to Fhelm, change your mind?${prompt}
  10724: Neither of you actually care about me. Ever since you began working as Records of Eminence guides, all you can think-wink about is how to make more gil!${prompt}
  10725: I can't completely deny that, because I do apprrreciate me some gil.${prompt}
  10726: How can you be so egocentric as to suppose that we spurned your company solely for the sake of profit? The real reason is that--${prompt}
  10727: Put a sock in it, Rrrolandienne!${prompt}
  10728: I apologize. I simply got carried away in the moment...${prompt}
  10729: |-
    Ah...
    H-hello, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10730: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    What's going on?
    Oooh, I love cat fights!${prompt}
  10731: I'm sorry you had to witness that unsavory-wavory display. It's just that...${prompt}
  10732: Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to play along with your japes today. To spare me the embarrassmentaru of you guessing what happened, let me tell you instead.${prompt}
  10733: These two just got done entreataruing me to help with an objective.${prompt}
  10734: That's the crrrux of the matter, at least.${prompt}
  10735: We believe that it is a tad difficult for us to carry out on our own, so we came to discuss the issue with Nantoto.${prompt}
  10736: |-
    But I'm not interested in rewards or spoils at all!
    And that's why you came to me... You knew you'd get half the pie for a third of the effortaru!${prompt}
  10737: Those catty rrremarks of yours couldn't be further from the truth. We're not trying to take advantage of you one bit.${prompt}
  10738: At any rate, we shall return when you are in a less ill humor.${prompt}
  10739: Cheerrrio, Toto!${prompt}
  10740: Haaah... I'm so drain-wained.${prompt}
  10741: At least I know you're not pretending-wending to be my friend to wring gil out of me, ${name-player}. I knew from the start you only cared about the reward.${prompt}
  10742: Yet I can't faultaru your work ethic. You've performed far better than I assumed you would.${prompt}
  10743: I have to say, though, part of me was jumping-wumping at the prospect of adventuring with my friends again.${prompt}
  10744: On the other hand, I no longer understand what motivatarus adventurers.${prompt}
  10745: I'd always assumed it was to appreciataru being with one's friends, but...${prompt}
  10746: What do you think? Is there a specific reason-weason you became an adventurer?${prompt}
  10747: |-
    What did you want to do as an adventurer?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explore unknown frontiers.
    Share experiences with friends.
    Stuff and things.
    Search for shiny equipment.
    Expand my intellectual horizons.
    Combat powerful entities.
    Nothing in particular.${prompt}
  10748: Well, at least you're honestaru. Straight answers can be so refreshing.${prompt}
  10749: |-
    You go “any way the wind blows,” eh?
    I envy-wenvy you. I could never bring myself to do something so radical.${prompt}
  10750: Unlike you, I...${prompt}
  10751: I simultaneously covetaru the adventurer lifestyle while withdrawing from it.${prompt}
  10752: What am I even doing...?${prompt}
  10753: Deep down, I understand that Records of Eminence, objectives, and adventuring are nothing more than impetus-wimpetuses.${prompt}
  10754: They're excuses to reach out, to make contactaru, to say, “I miss the time we spent together.”${prompt}
  10755: I just had to be stubborn-wubborn, though. If anyone here's a fool, it's definitely me.${prompt}
  10756: '...And now I''m complaining to you. Some embodimentaru of adventuring ideals I turned out to be.${prompt}'
  10757: Take this and leave me to wallow in my self-pity-wity already!${prompt}
  10758: Oh, to go adventuring again...${prompt}
  10759: |-
    Hey, I have an idea.
    Why not lightaru these fireworks from a place that has special meaning to you? A place that's overflowing with memories of the past.${prompt}
  10760: Then, could I ask you to share anything of significance-wificance you remember with those close to you?${prompt}
  10761: You don't have to...but if you do, I'd be in your debtaru.${prompt}
  10762: They say every adventurer has a reason for startaruing their journey. Sometimes I forget what mine was...${prompt}
  10763: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10764: I've been giving it some thoughtaru for a while now, and, well, I...${prompt}
  10765: I quitaru being an adventurer!${prompt}
  10766: Now because of that...I need to ask you a favor-wavor.${prompt}
  10767: You see, I got a little bit of Eternal Flame in me and kind of had A.M.A.N. make a special-wecial objective for me.${prompt}
  10768: They were nice enough to oblige me and post it publicly, for all to undertake, which I appreciataru.${prompt}
  10769: After mulling-wulling it over, though, I realized that I can't possibly completaru it alone.${prompt}
  10770: |-
    So, yeeeah... <Whistle>
    I'm going to need-weed you to do it for me.${prompt}
  10771: |-
    Wh-what'll you have to do?
    Well, uhhhm...just excommunicataru some Yagudo High Priests from Castle Oztroja, that's all.${prompt}
  10772: Someone so teensy-weensy as me couldn't even pull a feather off one of them, let alone baste a flock. You've been baptized by the Records of Eminence, though! You can defeataru almost anything that comes at you, so will you please help me?${prompt}
  10773: |-
    Will you help her?
    ${selection-lines}
    With pleasure.
    If you give a Taru a treat...${prompt}
  10774: I guess I'll just have to ask a more competentaru adventurer, then. One who won't fly the coop when faced with a challenge.${prompt}
  10775: |-
    I just knew you would!
    Now, go out and ground a few of those high flyers in the name of progress-wogress!${prompt}
  10776: Why Yagudo High Priests?${prompt}
  10777: I have my reason-weasons...${prompt}
  10778: '...and that''s why it had to be those theocratic thugs. I was sick of that sour-wour taste in my mouth.${prompt}'
  10779: |-
    Anything to say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I feel for you.
    So you took it out on me?${prompt}
  10780: I can't begin to describe how elatarued you've just made me. Thank you.${prompt}
  10781: So what if I did? You got a problem-woblem with that?${prompt}
  10782: 'Anyway, I''ve discovered that in the end, adventaruing comes down to three things: strength of mind, strength of body, and the strength of fortune.${prompt}'
  10783: I understand that the wheel of fate does not stop in the same place-wace for everyone...${prompt}
  10784: '...but still, I can''t help but feel slightarued.${prompt}'
  10785: That's my honestaru opinion.${prompt}
  10786: I won't ask for your empathy-wempathy or to have the scales fall from your eyes, I just want you to comply with my dumb requestaru.${prompt}
  10787: '...Not at the expense of your own life, though. I wouldn''t want to have that on my conscience-wonscience. Take as many companions as you can gather and don''t do anything I wouldn''t...wait, then you wouldn''t even undertake this objective.${prompt}'
  10788: If the “Grudge” objective I gave you seems too difficultaru or dangerous, feel free to leave it for later-water.${prompt}
  10789: You must be the envy of pugilistarus the world over.${prompt}
  10790: To think that I was worried about you not coming back alive due to my exorbitantaru demands...${prompt}
  10791: |-
    How silly-willy of me.
    I should have known that it would take more than a flock of zealous friars to kill you.${prompt}
  10792: Especially with the aura of confidence you exertaru, I can never count you out of any fight.${prompt}
  10793: Well, now that you've cleared the emotional cloud-wouds that hung over my heart, I can quit in peace. Too bad I'll have to look for a new place to stay, since I can't use my Mog House any more.${prompt}
  10794: But before I go, take this as thanks for all you've done-wone.${prompt}
  10795: Toto! Toto! We're not in Xarcabard anymore!${prompt}
  10796: Wh-what are you all doing-woing here?${prompt}
  10797: There is something we simply could not wait to share with you, Nantoto.${prompt}
  10798: While I am willing to share my love with anyone at any time, this gift is more...substantial than that.${prompt}
  10799: I wanted to give you one of my teacherly hugs for motivation, but we decided on pouring our blood, sweat, and tears into getting you this instead. Enjoy!${prompt}
  10800: Why, this is...${prompt}
  10801: Go on and unrrravel it like a ball of yarn!${prompt}
  10802: But...why would you do this for a desertaru like me?${prompt}
  10803: No matter what you choose to do with your life henceforth, I have a feeling that you will end up using that to help us one way or another.${prompt}
  10804: Though my heart may swell with fraternal affection for all, it heals no one. Only you can cure the wounds of the masses. That scroll is best in your hands.${prompt}
  10805: I...I don't know what to say that won't sound tritaru...${prompt}
  10806: '${color-alt: 141}Nantoto uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.'
  10807: Nantoto learns a new spell!
  10808: I'm such a fool. I thought you'd given up on me, so I started actaruing like a meanie-weanie to you.${prompt}
  10809: In reality, though, <sniffle> you've had me in your heartarus all along... Waaah!${prompt}
  10810: Sorry, Toto. We would've said something to help brace you, but didn't want to spoil the element of surprrrise!${prompt}
  10811: I have to say that I expected our gift to bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes.${prompt}
  10812: It's just that...I believed you were avoiding me...so...${prompt}
  10813: I desperately wanted to tell you in advance, but Fhelm was dead set against it!${prompt}
  10814: I had no choice! You'd rrraise the fur on your back and hiss at us if we mentioned anything about a present.${prompt}
  10815: I...I'm touch-wouched. To think that I ever wanted to throw away my life as an adventurer...${prompt}
  10816: I've said so many terrible-werrible things, but...if you'd find it within yourselves to take me back...
  10817: Of course we do! Our bonds of friendship run deeper than the Sea of Shu'Meyo!${prompt}
  10818: The next time you're at a loss for an answer, remember to look to our collective love nestled deep inside you. It'll warm your soul like no other!${prompt}
  10819: I can't thank you...<sniffle>...enough...${prompt}
  10820: You will always have a spot behind my back, Nantoto, ever since you saved me from certain death.${prompt}
  10821: I still have the image of that day freshly imprintarued on my mind. We were fighting some harebrained warriors in the Valkurm Dunes--${prompt}
  10822: Could you please use a more flattering word like “audacious” or “venturous”? Otherwise, it makes me sound doubly pathetic for almost dying at their hands.${prompt}
  10823: You managed to pry me from death's icy grip, but we still had to flee in order to fight another day.${prompt}
  10824: And I met you on the hunt, rrright? Oh, how we used to fight like cats from dusk to dawn.${prompt}
  10825: |-
    Hahaha, we sure did.
    I remember having the most heated of argumentarus with you, then crying to Isakoth and Ervok afterwards.${prompt}
  10826: Assiduity and opportunity are one's most powerful assets on the path to enlightenment. The knowledge you gain from your travels across continents will be key to unlocking the gates to uncharted territories.${prompt}
  10827: Exploration is the testimony to one's courage. Likewise, Records of Eminence objectives are testimony to mankind's inquisitiveness.${prompt}
  10828: Myriad thoughts, feelings, and recollections are scattered over this vast land. We thus calmly gather them into our arms and release them anew unto the adventuring masses. We pay the price for our meddling, but so too do we reap the rewards. We dare, therefore we are.${prompt}
  10829: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10830: The influence each of you exerts during your eminent activities may be small in and of itself.${prompt}
  10831: However, those to whom you provide succor deeply appreciate your tireless efforts.${prompt}
  10832: Moreover, you do not provide aid exclusively to single individuals. Entire organizations also place their trust in you.${prompt}
  10833: Many within the A.M.A.N. possess financial resources the average commoner could only dream of. A chance opportunity from one of these individuals could yield untold riches.${prompt}
  10834: It is therefore no stretch of the imagination to say that we are able to subsist due to the noble work ethic of adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10835: In other words...scratch A.M.A.N.'s back, and it will scratch yours.${prompt}
  10836: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10837: For example, you have also made a pilgrimage to various telepoints scattered about the four corners of Vana'diel and dispersed the darkness that enshrouded the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  10838: These two objectives were both originally issued by a certain member of the San d'Orian elite.${prompt}
  10839: In contrast, the one Nantoto requested regarding an ouka ranman cannot be described as anything but an abnormality.${prompt}
  10840: 'That was one which I had to work behind the scenes to enact. If my memory serves me, you chose ${zone: 0[2]} as the spot in which to unleash your explosion of memories, correct?${prompt}'
  10841: Heh, fear not, for only you and I know that you consider that place a sanctuary. I will not tell a soul.${prompt}
  10842: Nor will I tell anyone about the valor you displayed in defeating the Yagudo High Priests to complete “Grudge.”${prompt}
  10843: '...However, I suppose Nantoto already knows that.${prompt}'
  10844: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10845: I can't adequataruly express how much I owe you for taking out those Yagudo!${prompt}
  10846: 'Listen, we''ve all decided-wided to go to ${zone: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  10847: We want to check on some reportarus concerning a humongous dragon that supposedly patrols the skies there.${prompt}
  10848: We've heard various rumors about a specific locale there where bounding insectarus gather. Hopefully we'll be able to find it.${prompt}
  10849: There's a mountain of hearsay about a flower there that floatarus in midair. I certainly want to see if it's actually real or not.${prompt}
  10850: There you are! I've been looking-wooking all over for you.${prompt}
  10851: I received a couple lettarus addressed to you.${prompt}
  10852: They all come in...uniquely colored envelope-wenvelopes and are signed “D.” What do you want to do with them?${prompt}
  10853: |-
    Open which one?

    The yellow one.
    The brown one.
    The red one.
    The rainbow one.${prompt}
  10854: I wouldn't open any if I were you, either. You never know what crazy-wazy stuff people deliver these days. I'd feel bad about throwing another person's property away, though, so I'll hold onto them for safekeeping.${prompt}
  10855: Here you go. I hope it doesn't contain anything too suspectaru.${prompt}

  10992: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson stares at you intently.'
  10993: Ah, my apologies. Please allow me to explain. I used to be an adventurer myself and can therefore discern your strength with a mere glance.${prompt}
  10994: By chance, have you ever heard of the A.M.A.N. Reclaimers?${prompt}
  10995: They're a group that goes around collecting various items and equipment.${prompt}

  10997: And yours truly is in charge of coordinating the collection of those items!${prompt}
  10998: Well, I guess you could say I'm more of an employee doing the A.M.A.N.'s bidding. Hahaha...${prompt}
  10999: 'So, if you bring me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I''ll exchange them for various goods.${prompt}'

  11001: I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!${prompt}
  11002: 'Stop by anytime and I''ll take any ${item-plural: 0[2]} that you manage to collect.${prompt}'
  11003: When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.${prompt}
  11004: Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?${prompt}
  11005: From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.${prompt}
  11006: I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!${prompt}
  11007: Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.${prompt}
  11008: At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!${prompt}
  11009: You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.${prompt}
  11010: Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.${prompt}
  11011: First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.${prompt}
  11012: You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!${prompt}
  11013: In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!${prompt}
  11014: Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.${prompt}
  11015: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson smiles at you gently.'
  11016: Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.${prompt}

  11036: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.${prompt}'
  11037: 'And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of ${number: 8} vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.${prompt}'
  11038: Among the wooden coffers you come across, a small fraction of them will be shimmering with a prismatic light.${prompt}
  11039: These “rainbow chests“ are sometimes present right from the outset, and they always contain a highly-sought-after reward inside.${prompt}
  11040: Some who have ventured into the trove have reported that if they open eight wooden chests--meaning that the only one left contains a mimic--the remaining chest will be overcome with the selfsame rainbow glow.${prompt}
  11041: Of course, I cannot even begin to fathom how lucky one would have to be for that to actually be the case. Perhaps it's but a rumor.${prompt}
  11042: Ah, yes. The good old belligerent bangs.${prompt}
  11043: The sound that the treasure chest makes when you eagerly open it, flinging the lid open and slamming it onto the back of the chest, has some correlation with whether or not the chest's reward is great, or merely “good.”${prompt}
  11044: Particularly astute adventurers will also note that opening a chest can provide a clue as to whether or not any of the remaining chests have particularly valuable rewards.${prompt}
  11045: However, it takes a few treasure chests to be able to properly triangulate your internal sensing systems. Opening three should be sufficient.${prompt}
  11046: If I could meet whomever or whatever was in charge of crafting these orbs, I would be inclined to give them a good smacking.${prompt}
  11047: But let's keep that between us, hm?${prompt}
  11048: Would you happen to be in possession of any used A.M.A.N. Trove orbs?${prompt}
  11049: The A.M.A.N. believes that littering the ground with used trinkets harms the beauty of the landscape, so we are happy to provide you with proper compensation should you trade me used orbs instead of discarding them.${prompt}
  11050: Who knows? If I'm feeling particularly generous that day, you may get a fresh orb for your troubles.${prompt}
  11051: Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.${prompt}
  11052: I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.${prompt}
  11053: However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.${prompt}
  11054: I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.${prompt}
  11055: I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.${prompt}
  11056: When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.${prompt}
  11057: To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...${prompt}
  11058: However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.${prompt}
  11059: Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.${prompt}
  11060: 'Of course, I''m happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I''d appreciate it if you could buy some ${item-plural: 0[2]} from me as well!${prompt}'
  11061: 'I have received a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you so far. Let me know if you wish to trade some of them for an orb.${prompt}'
  11062: Um... I'm sorry, but you can't carry any more. Would you like to exchange some for an orb or two?${prompt}
  11063: |-
    This one has already been used. Perhaps I can offer you a free one to satiate your lust for treasures.
    Here you are--a freshly charged ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  11064: |-
    This one has already been used. I'll give you a freebie, okay?
    Here. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  11065: Oh, this one hasn't been used yet. Nothing I can do with it.${prompt}
  11066: |-
    Hm? What's that?
    You're lookin' for's some girl, are ya?${prompt}
  11067: |-
    Ah, I know the girl yer talkin' about!
    The one who's here for the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt}
  11068: |-
    The festival's a very important event for us Goblins.
    It's been around fer ages now.${prompt}
  11069: It's held whenever we Goblins are in danger or the world itself has lost all hope...${prompt}
  11070: The festival helps bring us a sense of calm when we feel like prayin' is our only remainin' option.${prompt}
  11071: |-
    The last time it was held was over several hundred years ago...
    They say there was a battle 'tween the gods of light and darkness.${prompt}
  11072: |-
    Of course, the reason we're holdin' it again now goes without sayin'.
    Countless “World Eater Eggs” are being found across the land.${prompt}
  11073: Yes, I've heard all about you as well.${prompt}
  11074: Ya saved our Goblin heroes from certain death on Zepwell Island, yes?${prompt}
  11075: Even though you're no beastie, ya know just how terrifyin' a “World Eater Egg” from Chaos truly is.${prompt}
  11076: Therefore, you can understand the fear, anxiety, and general unease that we Goblins are feelin', right?${prompt}
  11077: |-
    In fact, it terrifies us beasties so much that many aren't even able to work.
    That's why we need to have this festival--to calm everyone's nerves.${prompt}
  11078: Hm? You wanna know how this girl yer lookin' for's involved with the festival?${prompt}
  11079: |-
    The Festival of Brave Souls is always a sad affair, so I thought it'd be good to prepare somethin' a bit more lighthearted.
    Ya know, to keep up wit' the times and all.${prompt}
  11080: So I put out a call for a skilled entertainer and that girl showed up.${prompt}
  11081: However, she was much weaker than I expected...${prompt}
  11082: So I sent her over to Maat in order to really push her to her limits and get her ready in time fer the festival.${prompt}
  11083: |-
    Huh? She forgot somethin' while she was there?
    And now you're tryin' to give it back to her?${prompt}
  11084: |-
    I see...
    In that case, I suppose it's okay if I tell you her whereabouts...${prompt}
  11085: |-
    According to her, she's always bein' hounded by her many throngs of fans.
    So she asked that I keep her location a secret.${prompt}
  11086: |-
    Although, we've had to shelve our plans to have her perform at the festival.
    I doubt there'll be much to see, let alone any of her fans.${prompt}
  11087: |-
    Here, I'll draw up a map for ya.
    Simply show it to the Tarutaru soldier in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.${prompt}
  11088: |-
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.
    He can show you where she's stayin'.${prompt}
  11089: |-
    As long as that shadow looms large, we can't have the festival.
    Is there anything that can be done...${prompt}
  11090: |-
    Show that map I drew ya to the soldier standin' in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.${prompt}
  11091: He can show ya how to find the girl yer lookin' for.${prompt}
  11092: |-
    Oh, this is a rare sightaru indeed. That's a map from a Goblin you're carrying.
    Very well, I can show you the way.${prompt}
  11093: |-
    Hello! Do you come bearing yet more gifts from my legions of adoring fans?
    You can just set them down over there.${prompt}
  11094: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    You forgot this!
    I'm a huge fan!
    Firesday Night Fever!${prompt}
  11095: Huh!? I-it can't be!${prompt}
  11096: Wh-where did you find this!?${prompt}
  11097: So ${name-player}, you heard everything, did you...${prompt}
  11098: I was hoping to seek out new challenges and take my idol career to the next level.${prompt}
  11099: You see, I wanted to form a dance duo with a Goblin girl so that we could display our talents on a worldwide stage.${prompt}
  11100: Uka felt that the image of the Mighty Maidens would suffer as a result, but I'm more worried about my act growing stale.${prompt}
  11101: I mean, I know I'm wildly popular with my fans and audiences everywhere, but I'm constantly doing the same show over and over again!${prompt}
  11102: |-
    They're waiting with bated breath for me to come out with a great new costume and even more songs and dance routines!
    You know, something real spectacular!${prompt}
  11103: It was then that things took a sudden turn...${prompt}
  11104: I heard the Goblins were planning some kind of festival.${prompt}
  11105: |-
    When you think of festivals, what comes to mind? That's right! The performances!
    And what better performance is there than the Heroine Stage Show?${prompt}
  11106: |-
    Somehow, the Goblins felt that my show lacked the proper punch.
    However, I know my fans would've given me the strength to put on a powerful performance.${prompt}
  11107: |-
    So I started thinking up some new poses and catchphrases.
    I worked really hard on them too...${prompt}
  11108: |-
    Even so, that Maat guy kept complaining about me though.
    He basically told me I was a failure as an idol!${prompt}
  11109: It caused me to lose some of my usual superstar swagger.${prompt}
  11110: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11111: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11112: Ah, there you are, Mumor. I come bearing news.${prompt}
  11113: Huh!?
  11114: |-
    This isn't good!
    This isn't good at all, kupo!${prompt}
  11115: What's wrong, Diva...err, I mean Kupolietta!?${prompt}
  11116: I was told that we might not be able to perform at the Festival of Brave Souls, kupo!${prompt}
  11117: |-
    Wait, what!?
    Why not!?${prompt}
  11118: |-
    It's all because of that rumor...
    That terrible rumor, kupo.${prompt}
  11119: They say an ominous shadow wanders to the east of Batallia Downs each and every night...
  11120: Apparently, everyone who sees it says the same thing, kupo...
  11121: “I saw something that nobody should ever have to see...”
  11122: They then leave Jeuno, never to return again...
  11123: |-
    Th-this is terrible news!
    Isn't the Festival of Brave Souls also held east of Batallia Downs!?${prompt}
  11124: |-
    Indeed it is, kupo.
    The cave there is the very heart of the festivities.${prompt}
  11125: Yet, as long as that shadow roams about, there's no way they can have the festival, kupo.${prompt}
  11126: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11127: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11128: And so, the brave Mumor found that she must rise up to strike down this shadowy threat!${prompt}
  11129: |-
    Yes, that's right!
    I must take my destiny into my own hands!${prompt}
  11130: |-
    Although, as it stands, I'm just a lone idol.
    I'll never be able to muster the necessary strength for this task.${prompt}
  11131: |-
    So that's where you come in.
    This is your chance to join me as a Mighty Maiden!${prompt}
  11132: |-
    I mean, you're an adventurer, right?
    Come on, together, we'll form an unstoppable duo!${prompt}
  11133: |-
    Form a duo with Mumor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, why not.
    I think I'll pass.
    I'm not really a maiden...${prompt}
  11134: |-
    Thank you so much!
    It's settled then! We'll be known as the Dashing Damsels!${prompt}
  11135: |-
    What's that?
    Speak up, I can't hear you.${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Hooray!
    We're going to be the best duo ever!${prompt}
  11137: Come on--deep down, everyone has something of a girlish side.${prompt}
  11138: From today forth, we shall be known as the Delightful Damsels!${prompt}
  11139: There's nothing like the sweet feelings of love that come from a warm and caring heart.${prompt}
  11140: |-
    We'll show that sinister shadow what for!
    Come, we march for Batallia Downs at once!${prompt}
  11141: Hm? You're wondering if I know aboutaru the mysterious shadow that wanders Batallia Downs after dark?${prompt}
  11142: |-
    Of course I do!
    You'd be smartaru to stay away from the cave in eastern Batallia Downs--the one within view of the ocean.${prompt}
  11143: But, if you think you have what it takes to stand againstaru this shadow, I won't try to stop you.${prompt}
  11144: Are ya here 'bout the Festival of Brave Souls too?${prompt}
  11145: |-
    Oh well, I guess it can't be helped.
    The most important site for the festival is a cave east of Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  11146: |-
    Five thousand years ago, many brave warriors lost their lives.
    That location is currently servin' as their burial mound.${prompt}
  11147: |-
    But there's a mysterious shadow prowlin' their eternal resting place.
    Unfortunately, it's keepin' us from going anywhere near it.${prompt}
  11148: |-
    Unbelievable!
    Why am I just hearing about this now!?${prompt}
  11149: I understand your frustration, but this story was written for us by a famous Goblin author.${prompt}
  11150: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I'm glad you're here!${prompt}
  11151: You know my show that was scheduled for the Festival of Brave Souls?${prompt}
  11152: Get this, they're calling it the “Mighty Maiden Fantastox Heroine Stage Show”!${prompt}
  11153: |-
    First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?
    My name is Mumor!${prompt}
  11154: |-
    Fantastox's a famous Goblin thief.
    Her specialties include Sneak Attacks and Trick Attacks.${prompt}
  11155: So I'm supposed to team up with this thief against the enemy, right!?${prompt}
  11156: Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt}
  11157: |-
    Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?
    That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt}
  11158: In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt}
  11159: |-
    And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?
    Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt}
  11160: |-
    I know, right?
    We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt}
  11161: |-
    I get it!
    So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt}
  11162: |-
    Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...
    But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt}
  11163: |-
    Wait, what!?
    You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt}
  11164: |-
    Oui, c'est ça.
    Je vous le dis depuis le tout début.${prompt}
  11165: |-
    Hé, c'est ${name-player} !
    Que fais-tu ici !?${prompt}
  11166: Ah ! C'est le brave héros, Gloom Phantom !${prompt}
  11167: Brave héros... ?${prompt}
  11168: Je suis venu dès que j'ai reçu votre message !${prompt}
  11169: Donc l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » a été trouvé en plein cœur de Jeuno !${prompt}
  11170: |-
    C'est exact.
    Avant que quiconque ne réalise qu'il s'agissait de l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes », il est passé des mains capables d'un gobelin à quelqu'un qui l'a mangé...${prompt}
  11171: Quoi !? La coquille s'est cassée sans avoir besoin de mon épée !?${prompt}
  11172: |-
    Oui, c'est un véritable mystère.
    On ne sait pas non plus d'où venait cet « Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » à l'origine.${prompt}
  11173: L'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes... ?${prompt}
  11174: Au final, c'est cette fille là-bas qui a donné l'œuf à l'homme connu sous le nom de Maat, qui l'a ensuite mangé sans plus tarder.${prompt}
  11175: |-
    Euh... eh bien, je...
    Il m'a dit qu'il avait faim, alors j'ai simplement apporté ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} que j'ai trouvé à proximité...${prompt}
  11176: Ce que je veux savoir, c'est où était l'œuf avant cela ?${prompt}
  11177: Je ne connais pas les détails, mais j'ai entendu qu'un monstre près de la Tour de Delkfutt le transportait.${prompt}
  11178: |-
    Delkfutt ?
    Où ai-je déjà entendu ce nom...${prompt}
  11179: |-
    La Tour de Delkfutt se trouve sur l'île de Qufim, qui est sur le territoire des Gigas.
    Il est clair que la mort certaine nous attend là-bas.${prompt}
  11180: Puis-je demander votre aide dans cette affaire, brave héros ?${prompt}
  11181: |-
    C'est pourquoi je suis là !
    Laissez nous tout !${prompt}
  11182: Hmm... Peut-être qu'un des Gigas sait quelque chose sur l'œuf et le monstre qui l'avait...${prompt}
  11183: |-
    J'ai compris !
    Nous irons sur l'île de Qufim et capturerons l'un des Gigas là-bas pour l'interroger !${prompt}
  11184: Vous pouvez aussi nous aider, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  11185: |-
    Allez-vous nous aider ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bien sûr, comptez sur moi !
    Désolé, je suis occupé.${prompt}
  11186: Bien sûr, Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim !${prompt}
  11187: Où est passée votre soif d'aventure !?${prompt}
  11188: Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim, alors pas besoin d'avoir peur !${prompt}
  11189: D'accord, nous vous attendrons devant la Tour de Delkfutt !${prompt}
  11190: |-
    C'est rare de rencontrer un tel héros puissant en personne.
    Il n'y en a pas beaucoup qui peuvent attirer les autres à leur cause aussi facilement.${prompt}
  11191: |-
    Quant à vous...
    Je crois que les gens vous appelaient "cette horreur de la tour" auparavant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11192: Donc clairement, cela fait de vous le parfait méchant pour notre histoire.${prompt}
  11193: |-
    Je prends cela comme une insulte !
    Vous ne savez évidemment pas ce qui est important dans un spectacle de l'héroïne !${prompt}
  11194: Q-quoi avez-vous dit !?${prompt}
  11195: Si vous ne savez pas comment un spectacle est censé résonner avec ses fans, alors je suppose que je vais juste devoir vous enseigner !${prompt}
  11196: Ouf ! C'était intense.${prompt}
  11197: Elle a dit qu'elle rentrerait chez elle chercher un vieux script ou quelque chose comme ça.${prompt}
  11198: Je crois qu'il vaudrait mieux que je saisisse cette chance pour m'éloigner d'ici le plus loin possible...${prompt}
  11199: |-
    En ce qui vous concerne, vous devez aller aider Gloom Phantom à la Tour de Delkfutt sur l'île de Qufim.
    Vous avez compris ?${prompt}
  11200: Quoi qu'il en soit, ce Gigas nommé Echion connaissait certaines choses, mais pas d'autres.${prompt}
  11201: |-
    Je vois...
    Bien que, nous ne savons toujours pas comment l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” a été ouvert sans utiliser ton épée.${prompt}
  11202: En effet. Même les morts-vivants eux-mêmes ne devraient pas pouvoir l'ouvrir.${prompt}
  11203: Cependant, ils semblent avoir la capacité de trouver l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes”.${prompt}
  11204: |-
    Néanmoins, je suis stupéfait par la stupidité des Gigas.
    Tout cela est arrivé parce qu'ils ont trouvé l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” et l'ont laissé tranquille.${prompt}
  11205: Ils ignorent simplement tout ce que nous avons à dire !${prompt}
  11206: De plus, ils ne se rendent pas compte à quel point Chaos est vraiment terrifiant !${prompt}
  11207: Il y a cinq mille ans, celui connu sous le nom de Chaos cherchait à détruire tout ce qui était nouveau, même le monde lui-même...${prompt}
  11208: |-
    Cela incluait les Gobelins, les Yagudo, les Orcs, les Quadav...
    Tout ce qui était différent de lui-même.
  11209: Un grand nombre d'espèces se sont éteintes avant que les plus forts de ceux qui restaient ne se rassemblent.
  11210: Les Gigas se sentent ainsi parce que lors de la bataille contre Chaos il y a cinq mille ans, ils n'étaient même pas encore nés.${prompt}
  11211: Donc, il est impossible qu'ils aient pu connaître la haine de ceux qui ont été dévorés par Chaos.${prompt}
  11212: Eh bien, je n'aime pas qu'ils ne nous croient pas juste parce qu'ils n'ont pas vu quelque chose eux-mêmes.${prompt}
  11213: Au fait, à propos de ce mort-vivant qui transportait l'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes...${prompt}
  11214: Le mage connu sous le nom de Garazu-Horeizu qui peut contrôler les morts-vivants est-il impliqué d'une manière ou d'une autre ?${prompt}
  11215: En fait, nous ne connaissons pas vraiment la réponse à cela nous-mêmes.${prompt}
  11216: Eh bien, quelqu'un doit bien savoir quelque chose !${prompt}
  11217: P-peut-être que celui-ci sait q-quelque chose ?${prompt}
  11218: |-
    Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Le livre sur la théorie des tourbillons... ?
    La Quatrième Guerre Yagudo... ?
    Désolé, j'ai oublié.${prompt}
  11219: |-
    Comment ça, tu as oublié !?
    Je vais t'arracher tes pétales moi-même !${prompt}
  11220: |-
    Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Comme la théorie du tourbillon ?
    Que dirais-tu de la Guerre Yagudo ?
    Était-ce les “découvertes nouvelles” ?${prompt}
  11221: Hmm... Je ne suis pas sûr si ça rend les choses plus claires ou non.${prompt}
  11222: |-
    Je pense que j'ai une assez bonne idée.
    On peut demander à Dazbog d'expliquer le reste plus tard.${prompt}
  11223: C-c'est bien, mais nous n'avons toujours pas résolu le mystère...${prompt}
  11224: Nous ne l'avons pas !?${prompt}
  11225: C-clairement, Garazu-Horeizu voulait des informations sur Chaos afin d'apprendre un nouveau type de magie.${prompt}
  11226: I-il a enquêté sur Chaos même après sa mort et son voyage à V-Valhalla...${prompt}
  11227: M-mais Chaos a été vaincu à Valhalla...${prompt}
  11228: |-
    Oui, c'est vrai !
    Odin a porté le coup final en personne !${prompt}
  11229: Attends, je croyais que c'était un brave héros gobelin qui avait porté ce coup il y a cinq mille ans ?${prompt}
  11230: Hein ? Dans la bataille pour les Terres du Milieu, c'est mon ancêtre qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
  11231: Cependant, Chaos n'était pas un adversaire ordinaire.${prompt}
  11232: Chaos a été ressuscité dans un monde au-delà de celui-ci...${prompt}
  11233: Ainsi, mon ancêtre et de nombreux autres vaillants guerriers ont voyagé jusqu'à Valhalla et ont poursuivi le combat, même après la mort.${prompt}
  11234: Ah, ce sont donc les guerriers dont nous pleurons la mort dans le cadre du Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
  11235: Ainsi, à la toute fin, c'est Odin qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
  11236: Hmm... Donc clairement, Chaos a trouvé sa fin il y a bien longtemps.${prompt}
  11237: |-
    C'est un soulagement.
    J'étais inquiet de ce que je ferais si Chaos était encore en vie aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11238: |-
    Ce n'est pas juste moi non plus. Tous les gobelins ressentent cette crainte.
    C'est pourquoi nous avons commencé le Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
  11239: Je soutiens entièrement ce festival aussi !${prompt}
  11240: |-
    Je l'ai !
    On peut l'appeler le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Souvenez-vous de la Bataille contre Chaos” !${prompt}
  11241: Répète ça ?${prompt}
  11242: C'est un spectacle que nous pouvons présenter lors du Festival des Braves Âmes !${prompt}
  11243: 'Ou, nous pouvons simplifier un peu le nom et l’appeler simplement le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Vaincre Chaos” !${prompt}'
  11244: De quoi elle parle !?${prompt}
  11245: Elle n'est pas satisfaite du spectacle pour le festival, donc elle essaie de me convaincre de le changer.${prompt}
  11246: |-
    Tu as raison...
    Elle est là depuis le début.${prompt}
  11247: Cela m'est venu après vous avoir tous entendus parler !${prompt}
  11248: Cet être maléfique connu sous le nom de Chaos a essayé d'éradiquer quiconque était différent de lui, donc diverses créatures ont travaillé ensemble pour s'y opposer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11249: |-
    Et ensuite, cet ennemi s'est levé de nouveau pour mettre la terre en danger !
    Cette histoire a tout ce qu'il faut - de vraies larmes, suivies de tout le monde vivant heureux pour toujours !${prompt}
  11250: Une histoire comme celle-là contient tout ce que les fans veulent voir dans un spectacle de scène héroïque !${prompt}
  11251: 'Premièrement: tout le monde devient plus fort grâce à leurs différences !${prompt}'
  11252: 'Deuxièmement: ils surmontent leurs différences et travaillent ensemble !${prompt}'
  11253: 'Troisièmement: il y a des moments de tristesse, mais les gens se relèvent dans un esprit d’espoir !${prompt}'
  11254: Hmm... Quand on le dit comme ça...${prompt}
  11255: De plus, une fois que tout le monde aura vu le spectacle, ils ne seront pas comme les Gigas et ne croiront pas en quelque chose parce qu'ils ne l'ont jamais vu auparavant !${prompt}
  11256: Oui, je suppose que tu as raison...${prompt}
  11257: D'accord ! J'y réfléchirai sérieusement !${prompt}
  11258: Vraiment !?${prompt}
  11259: Cependant, en ce qui concerne Valhalla...${prompt}
  11260: Le Chaos a peut-être caché l'œuf avant sa mort.${prompt}
  11261: |-
    Oui, c'est totalement possible !
    Cependant, je pense qu'Odin aurait remarqué...${prompt}
  11262: Peut-être que son nez était bouché, ou qu'il avait autre chose en tête à ce moment-là.${prompt}
  11263: |-
    C'est vraiment un mystère...
    J'aimerais pouvoir demander à Odin personnellement.${prompt}
  11264: Quoi !? Tu réalises que cela signifie que tu devrais être morte, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
  11265: Bien sûr que je ne veux pas mourir, mais je ne veux pas non plus retourner à Hazhalm !${prompt}
  11266: D-dans ce cas, on pourrait toujours demander à l'un des démons d'Odin...${prompt}
  11267: Oh ! Tu as raison ! C'est une excellente idée !${prompt}
  11268: Y en a-t-il un avec qui nous pouvons facilement parler ?${prompt}
  11269: |-
    Il y en a quelques-uns ici à Jeuno.
    Ils se déguisent en personnes ordinaires.${prompt}
  11270: D'accord alors ! Allons-y !${prompt}
  11271: Après avoir entendu l'enthousiasme de cette fille, j'ai décidé de prendre sérieusement en considération sa proposition.${prompt}
  11272: Avec un spectacle basé sur la bataille contre le Chaos, nous pouvons toucher des gens qui pourraient ne rien savoir à ce sujet.${prompt}
  11273: |-
    Le problème est quel rôle je peux lui faire jouer...
    Hmm... Et si elle jouait le Chaos...?${prompt}
