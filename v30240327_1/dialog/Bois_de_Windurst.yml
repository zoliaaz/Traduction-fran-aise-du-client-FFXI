    This guild gets hundreds of orders from royalty all around Vana'diel.
    I'm just working here part-time to help them keep up with the load.${prompt}
  7312: Sorry, but my hands are tied...${prompt}
  7313: Sorry, but you don't have enough gil. With my part-time wages, I can't afford to bend the rules.${prompt}
  7314: Okay. Close your eyes really tight...${prompt}
  7315: 'Why don''t you try ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? It''s this year''s latest model. You''ll need...${prompt}'
  7316: Oh yeah, and if you have any garments that you don't wear anymore, you can always sell them here. With all these orders, we need all the extra material we can get.${prompt}
  7317: 'I''m beginning to see that you are no ordinary adventurer. Maybe it''s time that you got serious about weaving. Bring me a handmade ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7318: If your designs are as marvelous as people around the city are starting to say, I'll grant you the title of craftsman.${prompt}
  7319: But you'll have to remember...there is still a lot left to learn. Stick your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds, and you'll get full!${prompt}
  7320: If you still wish to pursue your studies in other guilds, I must ask you to part with us here.${prompt}
  7321: |-
    Marvelous! Once again, your work amazes me!

    Ring any bells?${prompt}
  7327: |-
    Well, you must have one terrible memory, because I heard that you went and became a craftsman at another guild!
    Haven't you noticed that your weaving skills are not improving like they used to?${prompt}
  7328: It's all because you can't focus on the fabric with all this other junk in your tiny little brain! Now, if you were to give up the craftsman status of all those other guilds...${prompt}
  7329: |-
    Revoke all other craftsman statuses?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's do it!
    I'm not one for focusing.${prompt}
  7330: |-
    Wonderful! Now you can clear your mind and start weaving again.

    I guess that ${lettercase: 2}${name-player} is just another brand headed for the bargain bin...${prompt}
  7332: |-
    Hm? A special order?
    Well, get in line, honey. The minimum wait on genuine Ponono is at least six years.${prompt}
  7333: '.........${prompt}'
  7334: I see that your situation is a little more severe than a supper party at the consulate's mansion. However, even if I do help you out, I'm not so sure how much luck you'll have in fooling those sly birdmen.${prompt}
  7335: And what if you get caught? Officials on both sides will start asking questions, snooping around...and before you know it, the costume will lead them right back to me! I could be ruined!${prompt}
  7336: |-
    ...But on the other hand, if you succeed, it would prove that my designs were even irresistible to the beastmen! Alright, I'll do it!
    Go out and find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and I'll get started on the pattern design.${prompt}
  7337: |-
    Oh, and I'll need ${number: 2} gil as well for supplies.
    What? You don't think parchment grows on trees now, do you? What? It does?${prompt}
  7338: |-
    Calm down, calm down. I'm still working on the design. I could be weaving vermillion cloaks, you know.
    Anyway, come back later, and don't forget the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, and the ${number: 2} gil I asked for.${prompt}
  7339: What's this? You're not thinking about abandoning this splendid venture, are you?${prompt}
  7340: You're just in time, my friend. I've completed the design and now I can begin working on the pattern. I'll need a couple of days, but you don't mind waiting a little longer, do you?${prompt}
  7341: |-
    ......
    Don't tell me you've...you've...you've lost an original Ponono pattern!? Just think if one were to make its way to the black market! They'd be making fake Pononos left and right! I'd be ruined!${prompt}
  7342: |-
    And I bet you want another one, right?
    ${selection-lines}
    You read my mind.
    Actually, no.
    I've had enough of this...${prompt}

    Pay ${number: 1} gil?

    Of course!
    You've got to be crazy!${prompt}
  7345: |-
    Okay. I'll forgive you this time, but don't let it happen again!
    Come back in a few days to pick up the pattern.${prompt}
  7346: You cannot rush a great artist! Can Goochichi-Vinchichi sew a luxurious handbag in a day? Can Naphille piece together one of her pochettes with a sweaty adventurer breathing down her neck? I think you know the answer. Now shoo!${prompt}
  7347: |-
    The cutting is complete!
    And quite a masterpiece, I must say.${prompt}

  7351: And I hope you've been brushing up on your bonecrafting and leatherworking skills. Hey, I didn't say that this job would be easy.${prompt}
  7352: But I have one hundred and two-percent faith in you. I know you have what it takes to pull off this project. I would've kicked you out of my guild a long time ago if you didn't!${prompt}
  7353: And once the headpiece is finished, you'll be the ${choice-player-gender}[most handsome/hottest] Yagudo in Vana'diel!${prompt}
  7354: What? Did you think that I was going to finish the project for you? I'm sorry, ${name-player}, but as much as I'd love to help you, I cannot put my guild and the people that work here at risk. Do you see poor Anillah over there? She has nine little brothers and sisters to feed!${prompt}
  7355: But I do understand that you definitely do not have enough skill to pull off this job on your own.${prompt}
  7356: How about this...${prompt}
  7357: I'll give you the recipe for the headpiece. You jot that down, and then go out and find one of my star pupils and have her make it for you! You'll need the following things:${prompt}
  7358: You should have no problem finding a kind adventurer to whip together that hat for you.${prompt}
  7359: Just make sure she's a weaving adept, and that she has skills in bone and leathercraft.${prompt}
  7360: Oh, and don't forget to thank her generously for her services. Climbing the weaver ranks is not easy...and definitely not cheap!${prompt}

    Mon assonance ! Elle m'a fait parler-marcher comme un Tarutaru maintenant !${prompt}
  7632: |-
    Oups...!
    Garde ce que j'ai dit pour toi, d'accord ? Particulièrement ne le dis pas à la grande chef !${prompt}
  7633: |-
    Ah !
    Ne me dis pas que tu as vendu ma pierre pour cette somme dérisoire !${prompt}
  7634: |-
    Grrr... Si tu ne l'avais pas vendue, nous aurions pu recevoir une plus grande récompense de ce voyageur stupide pour l'avoir retrouvée...
    Bon, tant pis... Ça ne vaut plus la peine de m'en soucier.${prompt}
  7635: |-
    Ahhh...
    J'ai voyagé jusqu'ici depuis Bastok, mais j'ai perdu la pierre qui était le but de mon voyage.${prompt}
  7636: |-
    Hm ?
    Quel genre de pierre ai-je perdue ?${prompt}
  7637: C'était une roche que nous avons trouvée dans les Mines de Palborough, au nord de Bastok. Elle contenait de petites traces de mithril.${prompt}
  7638: |-
    Mais ce n'est pas tout...
    En plus du mithril, il y a une source de magie inconnue à l'intérieur.${prompt}
  7639: Si on parle de magie, on pense à Windurst, non ? J'espérais que le Rhinostery l'examine, alors je suis venu jusqu'ici.${prompt}
  7640: Mais maintenant que j'ai perdu la pierre en question, je suis perplexe. Après tous les dangers que j'ai traversés pour mettre la main sur cette pierre... Je suis vraiment à bout de nerfs !${prompt}
  7641: 'J’ai annoncé que je paierais une récompense à celui qui retrouverait mon ${item-singular: 1[2]}, mais je n’ai reçu aucune réponse.${prompt}'
  7642: Je vais devoir retourner dans les profondeurs des Mines de Palborough et en déterrer une autre... mais cet endroit est tellement dangereux, et... comment puis-je montrer mon visage à Bastok !?${prompt}
  7643: |-
    Oh...! Ooohhhww...!
    Juste au moment où j'avais perdu tout espoir ! Merci ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
  7644: Comment puis-je jamais te rembourser ? Les mots ne peuvent exprimer ma gratitude, alors accepte ceci, s'il te plaît...${prompt}
  7645: |-
    Maintenant, je peux montrer mon visage à Bastok à nouveau ! Les mots ne pourront jamais exprimer ma gratitude...
    Juste... merci !${prompt}
  7646: Merci pour ton aide l'autre jour ! J'ai pris cette pierre et l'ai laissée au Rhinostery.${prompt}
  7647: Je vais juste faire un peu de tourisme en attendant les résultats. En fait... J'ai déjà vu chaque recoin de cet endroit en cherchant frénétiquement la pierre que j'avais perdue !${prompt}
  7648: Voici la porte de l'est--un lieu de rassemblement pour les gardes qui patrouillent dans les Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
  7649: Si tu cherches une carte de Windurst, dirige-toi vers l'ouverture là-haut. Une marchande Mithra en vend là-bas.${prompt}
  7650: |-
    Comment vas-tu～?
    Je vais bien, comme toujours...je pense.${prompt}
  7651: Nous avons eu quelques soucis à cause de ces bêtes Yagudo, mais le Capitaine Rakoh Buuma est sur place, alors les choses sont sous contrôle... enfin, je pense.${prompt}
  7652: Allez-vous vous joindre à nous pour combattre le bon combat ? Ce serait génial... enfin, je pense. Parlez au Capitaine Rakoh Buuma et elle vous mettra dans le bon chemin !${prompt}
  7653: 'Heu, vous semblez être d’un autre pays... enfin, je pense. Si vous cherchez le Consulat de ${choice: 2}[San d’Oria/Bastok], alors c’est ${choice: 2}[dans cette région/à l’ouest d’ici]...${choice: 2}[de l’autre côté du Bomingo Round/dans le Port Windurst].${prompt}'
  7654: Qu’est-ce que vous regardez ? Vous n’avez jamais vu une Mithra avant ?${prompt}
  7655: Ici dans les Bois de Windurst, il y a beaucoup de Mithra. Vous vous y habituerez bientôt...${prompt}
  7656: C’est les Bois de Windurst, la partie de la ville des Mithra ! Nous, les Mithra, devons rester solidaires, alors sentez-vous le bienvenu, ami !${prompt}
  7657: |-
    Je, je suis l'une des gardes ici.
    <gloups>...
    Eh bien, euh, enchantée de vous rencontrer !${prompt}

    Refuser la mission.${prompt}
  7664: Les gars Hume disent tous qu'ils m'envient, vous savez, être entouré de dames Mithra toute la journée et tout ça... M-mais, pour vous dire la vérité, je suis vraiment fatigué, jour après jour.${prompt}
  7665: |-
    Vraiment, maintenant !?
    Bien sûr, vous pouvez laisser le vrai travail de chasse aux monstres aux Boomers de Buuma !${prompt}
  7666: Je préférerais vous confier le travail que nous trouvons le plus difficile, comme les missions plus délicates. Enfin, toute tâche impliquant des Tarutaru est délicate à notre avis...${prompt}
  7667: |-
    C'est la guérite orientale.
    N'hésitez pas à demander au Capitaine Rakoh Buuma quand vous avez besoin d'un coup de patte des Boomers de Buuma ! Elle est la meilleure !${prompt}
  7668: Les dames Mithra sont normalement très agréables et joyeuses, mais vous devez rester sur vos gardes !${prompt}
  7669: Un jour, je me suis assoupi un peu et, et, je me suis réveillé pour trouver des marques de morsure sur mes jambes ! Je, je ne veux pas être mangé !!!${prompt}
  7670: Ce Meeri-Wohri est un petit nerveux maladroit, vous savez ?${prompt}
  7671: Un jour, je me suis réveillé d'une petite sieste où je rêvais de manger un Mithkabob, seulement pour découvrir que je mâchais la jambe du petit gars ! J'espère ne pas lui avoir fait trop de mal...${prompt}
  7672: C'est la guérite orientale - un lieu de rassemblement pour les gardes qui patrouillent dans les Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
  7673: |-
    Expulser ceux qui voudraient subvertir la loi et l'ordre des Bois de Windurst...
    Protéger la population Mithra de toutes sortes de menaces et dangers...
    C'est le travail des gardes.${prompt}
  7674: Mais ces derniers temps, les monstres féroces sont en augmentation, et les bêtes détruisent la nature à leur guise, donc notre travail devient de plus en plus hectique.${prompt}
  7675: Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, peut-être pourriez-vous nous donner un coup de main de temps en temps afin de protéger la paix de notre belle ville.${prompt}
  7676: Par exemple, vous pourriez essayer de faire des missions... des tâches spéciales émises au nom de la Fédération de Windurst...${prompt}
  7677: Mais d'abord, vous préféreriez peut-être écouter notre explication sur le rôle des guérites avant de décider...${prompt}
  7678: |-
    Écouter l'explication des guérites ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Écouter ! Écouter !
    Faire la sourde oreille.${prompt}
  7679: Bien, permettez-nous alors d'expliquer. Sola Jaab, voulez-vous vous charger de l'honneur ?${prompt}
  7680: |-
    Bien reçu, Capitaine Buuma !
    Ce serait en effet un honneur...${prompt}
  7681: En résumé, les guérites sont là où nous, les gardes, travaillons et nous reposons.${prompt}
  7682: Nous administrons également des missions ici - des missions pour et au nom de notre pays.${prompt}
  7683: Les missions diffèrent des quêtes simples en ce qu'elles sont rendues comme un service à votre pays, donc le gouvernement vous accordera des points de rang pour chaque mission que vous accomplissez.${prompt}
  7684: Enregistrer suffisamment de points fera augmenter votre rang, ou votre position dans la société.${prompt}
  7685: |-
    Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?
    Si vous vous considérez comme un citoyen modèle de Windurst, je vous recommande de servir votre pays en essayant votre chance avec les missions.${prompt}
  7686: La raison même pour laquelle vous êtes venu à Windurst en premier lieu était parce que vous vouliez vous faire une place, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7687: |-
    Recevoir une mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accepter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  7688: Eh bien, je suppose qu'il n'y a pas grand-chose de plus à dire que "Peut-être la prochaine fois", hein ?${prompt}
  7689: Alors, vous n'avez pas besoin de connaître les guérites, hein ? Je suppose que vous ne serez pas intéressé à prendre des missions, alors... ?${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Bien dit !
    Cette réponse sincère est votre premier grand pas vers l'amélioration de Windurst.${prompt}
  7691: Alors, sans plus tarder, émettons votre première mission. Avez-vous juste la bonne mission pour ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] ?${prompt}
  7692: |-
    Dit comme une vraie femme !
    Cette réponse sincère est votre premier grand pas vers l'amélioration de Windurst.${prompt}
  7693: Alors, sans plus tarder, émettons votre première mission. Avez-vous juste la bonne mission pour notre sœur ici ?${prompt}
  7694: |-
    Ex... excusez-moi...
    Mais, euh, je connais une mission...${prompt}
  7695: |-
    Vous voyez... eh bien... euh...
    L'Orasterie dans la zone portuaire cherche un volontaire pour les aider dans une expérience magique à mener aux Ruines de Horutoto.${prompt}
  7696: Je sais que c'est un peu soudain, mais ils ont dit qu'ils étaient dans l'embarras car ils ne trouvaient personne pour les aider. Alors, euh, qu'en pensez-vous... ?${prompt}
  7697: |-
    Bien. Effectuez cette mission !
    L'Orasterie est le ministère qui gère une Académie de Mages pour améliorer les capacités magiques de l'armée.${prompt}
  7698: Pour accéder à l'Orasterie, vous devez vous rendre dans la zone portuaire en retournant vers l'ouest depuis cette guérite. Votre pays compte sur vous !${prompt}
  7699: |-
    J'ai, euh, un ami qui sert à l'Orasterie. I-il est tellement cool !
    M-mais je souhaite pouvoir être p-plus comme lui !${prompt}
  7700: Seuls les étudiants d'élite de l'École de Magie peuvent entrer à l'Orasterie. Donc, les Tarutaru à l'Orasterie sont les utilisateurs de magie les plus brillants de tout Windurst !${prompt}
  7701: Les Ruines de Horutoto sont un ensemble de vieilles tours dans Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Mais elles sont toutes en train de s'effondrer maintenant...
    Ce sont les Tarutaru qui les ont détruites. Ils insistent sur le fait que c'était à cause de la Grande Guerre, mais ça ressemble juste à des demi-vérités halfling pour moi.${prompt}
  7703: Vous n'êtes pas censé aller directement aux tours magiques, vous savez ? Vous êtes censé aller d'abord à l'Orasterie... je pense.${prompt}
  7704: L'Orasterie est responsable de l'Académie des Mages, vous savez ? C'est là que les Tarutaru pratiquent leurs sorts toute la journée pour les perfectionner. C'est le grand bâtiment dans la zone portuaire... je pense.${prompt}
  7705: Les détails de la mission seront expliqués lorsque vous rencontrerez le ministre de l'Orasterie. Je ne peux pas dire qu'il soit la personne la plus agréable, mais au moins il a du cran.${prompt}
  7706: Faites-nous honneur !${prompt}
  7707: |-
    Bon travail !
    Content de voir que vous êtes revenu en vie ! J'espère que la mission n'était pas trop dangereuse.${prompt}
  7708: L'allocation des points de rang selon vos efforts... vous a permis de monter au rang deux ! Félicitations !${prompt}
  7709: Avez-vous apprécié votre petit tête-à-tête avec le ministre de l'Orasterie ? Grrr... Oh, et avez-vous pu rencontrer sa petite sœur ?${prompt}
  7710: La sœur du ministre de l'Orasterie s'appelle Apururu. Vous sauriez si vous l'aviez rencontrée. Elle est aussi la ministre de la Manasterie.${prompt}
  7711: Les missions sont très bien, mais vous devriez aussi essayer quelques quêtes... Je pense !${prompt}
  7712: Parler aux habitants et essayer de les aider avec leurs problèmes... Cela peut être très bénéfique, vous savez !${prompt}
  7713: Vous arrivez juste au bon moment. La Manasterie juste là-bas demande de l'aide pour la fabrication de gardes automates à l'atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
  7714: Étant donné que l'atelier de Cardians est juste à côté, vous ne pouvez guère refuser cette mission, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7715: |-
    Acceptez-vous cette mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accepter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  7716: Demandez aux employés de l'atelier de Cardians les détails.${prompt}
  7717: L'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie est tout droit là-bas, sur le côté droit de la Bomingo Round.${prompt}
  7718: |-
    Vraiment ?
    Dommage alors.${prompt}
  7719: L-les Cardians ont été inventés pour combattre en tant que soldats magiques de type marionnette lors de la Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
  7720: G-grâce à la création des Cardians, les gardes Tarutaru et Mithra ont moins souffert de blessures.${prompt}
  7721: Comparés à nous, les Cardians sont inutiles. Ils n'ont aucun sens lorsqu'il s'agit de combattre.${prompt}
  7722: Cependant, je dirai ceci à leur sujet... ils n'ont pas peur de la mort. Même nous, Mithra, ne sommes pas aussi courageux qu'eux. Cela pourrait être un avantage puissant...${prompt}
  7723: Allez tout droit dans cette rue là-bas, et quand vous arrivez à la ronde, vous verrez un grand bâtiment sur votre droite... Je pense. Eh bien, c'est l'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie, vous savez ?${prompt}
  7724: Pour trouver les entrées du bâtiment, vous devrez peut-être vous promener un peu. Mais ce n'est pas assez pour vous perdre ou quelque chose comme ça... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
  7725: Je suis sûr que le ministre de la Manasterie vous donnera les détails de votre mission.${prompt}
  7726: Les Cardians sont utiles lorsque vous recherchez la quantité plutôt que la qualité. Quoi qu'il en soit, menez bien votre mission--au moins cela nous aidera-t-il à maintenir la paix avec notre ministère voisin !${prompt}
  7727: |-
    Bonjour ! Et vous êtes...
    Oh, le volontaire pour nous aider avec la petite mission de ma Manasterie, c'est bien ça ?${prompt}
  7728: |-
    Très gentil de votre part d'être venu.
    Je m'appelle Apururu. Je suis la ministre de la Manasterie, et responsable de cet atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
  7729: Mais d'abord, je devrais vous donner un aperçu de ce qu'est la Manasterie, je suppose.${prompt}
  7730: La Manasterie est le ministère chargé de la production de gardes automates, également appelés Cardians. En ce qui concerne la puissance militaire, nos Cardians sont les seconds seulement aux Warlocks de guerre de l'Orasterie.${prompt}
  7731: Avez-vous déjà essayé de parler à ces êtres semblables à des poupées qui répondent avec les mots des étoiles ? Eh bien, ce sont nos Cardians !${prompt}
  7732: Nous lançons un type spécial de magie sur une poupée faite de paille, de tissu et d'autres matériaux--c'est ce qui donne vie à un Cardian.${prompt}
  7733: Nous demandons aux marchands ambulants ou aux aventuriers de nous fournir la plupart des matériaux dont nous avons besoin pour fabriquer des Cardians. Mais il y a un matériau essentiel que nous ne pouvons pas demander à n'importe qui de nous fournir...${prompt}
  7734: C'est le cœur du Cardian--une Orbe de Mana. Sans une Orbe de Mana entièrement chargée, nous ne pouvons pas lancer notre magie spéciale sur le Cardian pour les garder animés.${prompt}
  7735: C'est pourquoi nous confions la tâche d'énergiser les Orbes de Mana avec de la magie aux aventuriers de Windurst seulement. Ces sphères sont très importantes, donc elles ne peuvent pas être confiées à des gens d'autres pays.${prompt}
  7736: Tenez... prenez ces six Orbes de Mana sombres qui ont perdu leur lueur.${prompt}
  7737: Vous devez vous rendre à la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto dans l'Est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  7738: C'est la seule tour de magie qui fonctionne encore assez bien pour énergiser les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
  7739: Demandez à Pore-Ohre aux Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
  7740: Vous pourriez trouver cette tâche assez difficile, donc si vous n'êtes pas tout à fait sûr de vous, demandez de l'aide à quelques-uns de vos compagnons aventuriers. Eh bien, bonne chance et ta-taru !${prompt}
  7741: Dernièrement, beaucoup de monstres ont commencé à errer sous la tour de magie du sud-est, alors assurez-vous d'être prêt pour l'aventure.${prompt}
  7742: Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici.${prompt}
  7743: Oh, et à moins d'avoir toutes les six Orbes de Mana sombres placées dans leurs réceptacles respectifs, l'énergie magique de la tour ne circulera pas du tout à travers elles. Assurez-vous d'avoir toutes les six en position avant d'actionner l'interrupteur sur le grand appareil magique à l'arrière de la base de la tour.${prompt}
  7744: |-
    Eh bien, prenez soin de vous.
    Essayez de ne pas vous attirer trop d'ennuis.${prompt}
  7745: Demandez à Pore-Ohre dans la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
  7746: Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici. Je vous attends.${prompt}
  7747: Presque toutes les Ruines de Horutoto ont été soufflées en morceaux il y a vingt ans en raison de l'énorme magie du héroïque “Maître du Millénaire”.${prompt}
  7748: La seule tour de magie qui reste à peine fonctionnelle, celle du sud-est, est totalement instable dans la quantité d'énergie qu'elle produit.${prompt}
  7749: Il est donc presque impossible de créer des Orbes de Mana de qualité, ce qui nous affaiblit considérablement.${prompt}
  7750: Les Orbes de Mana sont les cœurs des Cardians, vous savez ? Si un Cardian venait à perdre son Orbe de Mana, il redeviendrait juste une poupée de paille inanimée.${prompt}
  7751: Et, si l'énergie magique dans l'Orbe de Mana venait à s'épuiser, même si vous deviez la ré-énergiser avec les gadgets dans les tours de magie, ils oublieraient tout ce qu'ils avaient mémorisé jusqu'à présent.${prompt}
  7752: De toute façon, c'est ce qui est considéré comme “la mort” pour les Cardians.${prompt}
  7753: La raison pour laquelle la durée de vie des Cardians s'est raccourcie est que la qualité des Orbes de Mana s'est détériorée.${prompt}
  7754: Juste au moment où les monstres deviennent plus forts et où nous avons besoin de plus de Cardians que jamais auparavant, aussi... J'aurais horreur de penser à ce qui nous attend si les choses continuent ainsi...${prompt}
  7755: |-
    Quoi ?
    Des Cardians sauvages sont réapparus ?${prompt}
  7756: C'est une histoire assez gênante pour nous à la Manustery, mais certains des anciens Cardians de l'époque de la guerre se sont échappés et sont devenus sauvages...${prompt}
  7757: Ces anciens Cardians commettent des méfaits tels que le vol d'Orbes de Mana et l'attaque de personnes.${prompt}
  7758: Les Orbes de Mana sont leur cœur, vous vous en souvenez ? Donc la raison pour laquelle ils volent les Orbes de Mana est de ressusciter leurs amis qui ont épuisé leur magie dans leurs Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
  7759: Mais les Orbes de Mana ne sont que des sphères de magie. À moins qu'il n'y ait un mage capable d'utiliser l'Orbe de Mana et de donner vie aux Cardians, ils sont totalement inutiles.${prompt}
  7760: Donc même s'ils réussissent à voler les Orbes de Mana, cela ne leur sert à rien...${prompt}
  7761: Mais je suis heureux que vous et le pauvre Pore-Ohre soyez en sécurité. C'est le plus important.${prompt}
  7762: Eh bien, quoi qu'il en soit, merci pour tous vos efforts et votre travail acharné. À la prochaine fois, alors, ta-taru...!${prompt}
  7763: J'entends dire que les Cardians qui se sont échappés de notre surveillance se rassemblent sous terre dans les Ruines de Horutoto et complotent de mauvaises actions.${prompt}
  7764: Si nous les laissons tranquilles, l'énergie magique dans leurs cœurs d'Orbes de Mana s'épuisera, et ils redeviendront rien de plus que des poupées de paille.${prompt}
  7765: Mais un jour, je devrai faire quelque chose à propos du problème... Un jour...${prompt}
  7766: |-
    Merci beaucoup !♪
    On dirait que vous avez ré-énergisé toutes nos Orbes de Mana. Quelle grande aide vous avez été !♪${prompt}
  7767: Mais je suis content qu'il ne se soit rien passé de désastreusement mauvais... Récemment, certains des volontaires pour cette mission ont été attaqués par des Cardians sauvages à la sortie des Ruines de Horutoto !${prompt}
  7768: Quand on donne vie à l'inanimé, qui sait ce qui peut arriver ? On demande juste des ennuis.${prompt}
  7769: Mais c'est juste un risque que nous, employés de la Manusterie, devons prendre ! C'est juste que... J'aimerais bien qu'ils nous paient un peu plus pour les risques.${prompt}
  7770: L'ancien ministre était un homme terrible. Quand la guerre a pris fin, il a commencé à jeter nos Cardians à droite et à gauche.${prompt}
  7771: Bien sûr que les Cardians allaient s'enfuir. Et bien sûr qu'ils allaient revenir et enlever l'ancien ministre. Il aurait dû le voir venir !${prompt}
  7772: On dit que sous la tour sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto se trouve le cimetière où errent les âmes des Cardians jetés.${prompt}
  7773: Le ministre Apururu a déjà dit que sauver les âmes de ces automates est la responsabilité de la Manusterie.${prompt}
  7774: Alors, est-ce que ces missions vous ont aidé à devenir plus fort ? Peut-être êtes-vous prêt pour une mission qui implique les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  7775: De l'autre côté de l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta se trouve un endroit appelé Giddeus--le foyer des Yagudo.${prompt}
  7776: Vous connaissez les Yagudo, n'est-ce pas ? Ce sont les beastmen qui ont ravagé les prairies de Sarutabaruta depuis si longtemps.${prompt}
  7777: Mais l'actuelle Star Sibyl s'est donné pour mission de tenter de créer des relations amicales avec l'ennemi maudit...${prompt}
  7778: En conséquence, nous devons rendre hommage aux Yagudo avec des offrandes de nourriture en signe d'amitié. C'est là tout le cœur de cette mission.${prompt}
  7779: Tout d'abord, vous devez vous rendre au laboratoire biologique de la Rrrhinosterie aux Eaux de Windurst. Les chercheurs là-bas vous fourniront l'offrande alimentaire d'aujourd'hui pour les Yagudo.${prompt}
  7780: Les chercheurs vous diront ce que vous devez faire ensuite.${prompt}
  7781: Cette mission est importante et a été émise par la Tour des Cieux, ou plus précisément, la Star Sibyl elle-même. Contrôlez votre haine envers les hommes bêtes et remplissez cette mission du mieux que vous pouvez !${prompt}
  7782: |-
    Grrr... Mince alors !
    Combien de temps devons-nous continuer à rendre hommage à des charognards qui pourraient nous trahir à tout moment ?${prompt}
  7783: Quoi qu'il en soit, vous feriez mieux de vous rendre à la Rrrhinostery dans les eaux de Windurst, et de récupérer l'offrande alimentaire que les chercheurs là-bas ont préparée pour vous offrir à Giddeus.${prompt}
  7784: Je, je comprends parfaitement ce que dit la Star Sibylle...${prompt}
  7785: La Star Sibylle pense avant tout à la sécurité de nous, les Windurstiens.${prompt}
  7786: Je ne comprends juste pas pourquoi les Tarutaru craignent ces Yagudo.${prompt}
  7787: Comme, n'était-ce pas à cause de ce vieux Seigneur des Ombres qu'ils ont presque perdu la guerre il y a vingt ans ?${prompt}
  7788: Avec lui mort et enterré, même si nous devions avoir une guerre totale avec les Yagudo, nous sortirions quand même gagnants... je pense.${prompt}
  7789: Ce n'est pas comme si nous étions opposés de manière irréfléchie à un pacte d'amitié avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
  7790: 'Ces Yagudo ne tiennent pas leur part du marché. Nous avons le vieux dicton : "ne partage jamais un repas avec ceux qui ne tiennent pas leurs promesses."${prompt}'
  7791: |-
    Donc vous avez accompli la mission... ?
    Alors je vous recommanderai pour une promotion au rang deux.${prompt}
  7792: Je vous suggère d'essayer votre chance dans les conquêtes maintenant, car vous aurez besoin de gagner plus de points de rang avant que nous puissions vous confier d'autres missions.${prompt}
  7793: Vous pouvez obtenir les points de rang dont vous avez besoin en participant aux conquêtes régionales. Demandez au garde War Warlock responsable des conquêtes là-bas pour plus d'informations...${prompt}
  7794: À la prochaine.${prompt}
  7795: Grrr... Vous avez accompli cette mission, hein ? Cela signifie que nous avons donné aux Yagudo paresseux de la nourriture pour les rendre plus forts... je pense.${prompt}
  7796: Le capitaine Rakoh Buuma est également en désaccord avec la Star Sibylle à ce sujet, vous savez ? Nous devrions simplement refuser de donner cette mission à partir de maintenant... je pense.${prompt}
  7797: |-
    B-bien joué !
    Je savais que vous en étiez capable. J'espère que vous ne vous êtes pas fait mal.${prompt}
  7798: Si seulement ces Yagudo baissaient un peu leur garde, nous n'aurions pas à passer par tout ça juste pour leur donner leurs offrandes.${prompt}
  7799: Même si vous avez été promu au rang deux, vous êtes toujours un débutant. Mais ne soyez pas déçu...${prompt}
  7800: Les débutants peuvent esquiver le travail sans que les autres ne se plaignent beaucoup. Et vous pouvez aussi manger quelques snacks en secret, si vous êtes prudent.${prompt}
  7801: Avez-vous déjà été à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optisterie dans les eaux de Windurst ?${prompt}
  7802: Il semble qu'ils soient dans une mauvaise passe là-bas, car ils demandent de toute urgence à tout aventurier capable que nous avons sous la main de venir les aider.${prompt}
  7803: |-
    Qu'en pensez-vous, alors ?
    Si vous vous sentez prêt, pourquoi ne pas vous porter volontaire pour aider l'Optistery ?${prompt}
  7804: |-
    Accepter la mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accepter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  7805: Ensuite, rendez-vous immédiatement à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optistery. C'est du côté nord des eaux de Windurst, le bâtiment par lequel passe la route vers la guérite nord.${prompt}
  7806: La Bibliothèque de Magie est au nord-ouest d'ici dans les eaux de Windurst, la zone la plus éloignée des Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
  7807: La bibliothèque prête des livres si vous êtes intéressé... Pas que j'y sois jamais allé moi-même.${prompt}
  7808: J'ai entendu dire qu'ils avaient un problème avec les gens qui empruntent des livres et ne les rendent jamais. Grrr... Ces Tarutaru sont une proie facile !${prompt}
  7809: La Bibliothèque de Magie n'est pas magique que de nom. Presque tous les livres là-bas ont quelque sorte d'enchantement.${prompt}
  7810: Quand vous empruntez un livre, les bibliothécaires retirent temporairement la magie par mesure de sécurité. Mais parfois, ils oublient, alors faites attention !${prompt}
  7811: J'ai aussi emprunté des livres à la Bibliothèque de Magie, vous savez.${prompt}
  7812: Une fois, j'ai emporté un livre chez moi pour le lire, et dès que je l'ai ouvert, une armée de grenouilles en est sortie en sautant !${prompt}
  7813: J'ai emprunté autant de livres que possible par la suite, mais aucune grenouille ne m'est jamais sortie. Dommage, car elles étaient vraiment savoureuses !${prompt}
  7814: Vous allez à la bibliothèque, hein ? Ça me retourle... J'ai un livre en retard là-bas... je crois.${prompt}
  7815: Quoi ? Vous voulez savoir quel livre j'ai emprunté ? Eh bien, je ne le dirai pas, na !${prompt}
  7816: (Ne me demandez pas quel livre j'ai emprunté. Ce n'est pas comme si je les lisais vraiment... Ils sont bien au-dessus de mon âge de lecture.)${prompt}
  7817: Vous voulez savoir si j'ai un "livre restreint" en ma possession, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7818: Où dans Vana'diel avez-vous entendu ça ? On ne peut jamais être trop prudent, vous savez.${prompt}
  7819: |-
    D'accord, je vais vous le dire.
    Vous êtes un aventurier de deuxième rang, n'est-ce pas ? Alors permettez-moi de vous demander ce petit service que j'ai d'abord...${prompt}
  7820: Si vous me rendez service, je ferai de même... pour ainsi dire. Faites ce que je demande et je vous laisserai consulter le livre que j'ai trouvé. Qu'en dites-vous ?${prompt}
  7821: |-
    Écouter sa faveur ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Écouter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  7822: Si c'est comme ça, alors adieu, pigeon.${prompt}
  7823: Saviez-vous qu'il y a dans le canyon de Tahrongi une série de grottes connues sous le nom de Labyrinthe de Shakhrami ?${prompt}
  7824: |-
    Si vous examinez les rochers dans ces grottes avec ce ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} assez attentivement, vous devriez pouvoir trouver ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Je veux que vous m'en apportiez un.
    Bonne chasse !${prompt}

    Si vous examinez les rochers dans ces grottes avec ce ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} que vous avez là, vous devriez pouvoir trouver ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Je veux que vous m'en apportiez un.
    Pas de corail, pas d'affaire !${prompt}
  7827: Vous voulez aussi ce livre que nous avons trouvé, n'est-ce pas ? Alors vous aurez besoin de quelque chose à échanger avec le gros bonnet !${prompt}
  7828: |-
    Heh-heh-heh...
    Nous ne traitons pas en gils froids et durs, vous savez ? Nous préférons de petites et jolies valeurs...${prompt}
  7829: Hah ! Si vous voulez le livre que nous avons trouvé, alors vous êtes en plein dans une grosse affaire avec le gros bonnet, n'est-ce pas, maintenant ?${prompt}
  7830: |-
    Pourquoi cela, demandez-vous ?
    Eh bien, même ce marchand riche et avare des eaux de Windurst... Oups !${prompt}
  7831: |-
    Ignorez ce que je viens de dire.
    Je ferai des cordes de luth avec vos tripes si vous dites à quelqu'un ce que je viens de laisser échapper !${prompt}
  7832: |-
    Alors, vous avez réussi ?
    Tenez, je vous donnerai cette clé. Nous ferons la transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
  7833: |-
    Vous pouvez y aller.
    Je vous rejoindrai là-bas une fois que j'aurai terminé ici !${prompt}
  7834: Nous effectuerons notre petite transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Vous y allez.
    Je vous rejoindrai là-bas !${prompt}
  7836: Je suis surpris que vous ayez pu trouver ce que nous voulions. Maintenant, je suis impatient de me joindre au gros bonnet pour conclure l'affaire avec vous. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
  7837: Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais ne vous avisez pas de dire à qui que ce soit ce petit marché que nous allons conclure. Vous n'aurez aucune chance de survivre si vous crachez le morceau sur nous.${prompt}
  7838: Je ne supporte pas votre vue. Sortez d'ici et ne me montrez pas votre visage de sitôt.${prompt}
  7839: Certains Cardians transportaient plusieurs grosses boîtes hors de la Porte Principale dans les murs de Windurst.${prompt}
  7840: C'était amusant de leur jouer un mauvais tour, mais ça ne valait pas la peine. Ne dites pas que le crime ne paie pas !${prompt}
  7841: Je lui ai miaulé une fois, je lui ai miaulé mille fois. Nous devrions arrêter de mettre nos pattes sur tout ce qui sent les Cardians.${prompt}
  7842: Je ne veux plus jamais vivre ça !${prompt}
  7843: |-
    Vous êtes arrivé au bon moment.
    Nous venons de recevoir une demande d'aide pour une mission de grande envergure de la part de Heavens Tower, mais nous manquons d'aventuriers à envoyer pour le moment.${prompt}
  7844: La secrétaire de la Tour des Cieux vous expliquera en quoi consiste cette mission. Rendez-vous immédiatement là-bas.${prompt}
  7845: La Tour des Cieux est au nord d'ici, dans les murs de Windurst. La secrétaire là-bas devrait vous expliquer les détails.${prompt}
  7846: Gee... J'aurais aimé pouvoir participer à cette mission moi aussi !${prompt}
  7847: M-mais j'ai trop peur de demander à Sola Jaab, au, au cas où elle me croquerait littéralement la têtey-wettey !${prompt}
  7848: |-
    Une fois que vous acceptez cette mission, vous ne reviendrez pas ici de sitôt, vous savez.
    Et juste quand je commençais presque à vous apprécier... je crois.${prompt}
  7849: Une fois que vous irez dans un autre pays, vous réaliserez à quel point l'ancienne Windurst est agréable.${prompt}
  7850: La nourriture est excellente, vous pouvez faire des siestes à volonté, et arriver en retard est la norme. Tout le monde prend la vie facilement ici.${prompt}
  7851: |-
    Ah, ${name-player} !
    Tour des Cieux vous hèle !${prompt}
  7852: Eh bien, la garde Sibylle en chef elle-même, Semih Lafihna, est venue vous demander ! Il semble que vos activités dans les trois nations vous ont permis de monter en grade, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7853: Quoi qu'il en soit, vous devriez vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est aussi stricte envers elle-même qu'envers les autres !${prompt}
  7854: |-
    Semih Lafihna, hein ?
    Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais je n'aime pas cette fille.${prompt}
  7855: Quoi qu'il en soit, dépêchez-vous d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est stricte envers elle-même et envers les autres !${prompt}
  7856: Oh, alors voilà qui va rencontrer Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  7857: Tout le monde se dispute toujours pour savoir qui est le meilleur archer, le capitaine Rakoh Buuma ou Semih Lafihna, vous savez. Mais le capitaine Buuma est le meilleur, bien sûr... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
  7858: Les gardes Sibylles ne sont pas très aimées par la plupart des Mithra. Nous n'aimons pas les gens qui prennent des titres pompeux et qui pensent être meilleurs que le reste de la tribu.${prompt}
  7859: De plus, cette Semih Lafihna est tellement sérieuse et travailleuse, sa queue est si mince et brillante, et elle sait tout sur tout. Ça ne vous rend pas juste jaloux ?${prompt}
  7860: L-les gardes S-Sibylles sont les combattantes mithra qui, qui servent et protègent la grande Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7861: L-la plupart des M-Mithra à Windurst servent leur cheffe tribale. Vous voyez... les gardes Sibylles sont spéciales-speciales, même dans la société mithra.${prompt}
  7862: Cette mission a été émise par la dame d'attente en chef de Tour des Cieux, Zubaba.${prompt}
  7863: Bien que je ne sache pas grand-chose sur elle moi-même, Zubaba sert en tant que dame d'attente en chef depuis que la Star Sibylle actuelle est enfant...${prompt}
  7864: Ce n'est pas un personnage que vous osez faire attendre. Je vous recommande de vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Si vous remplissez bien une mission de la dame d'attente en chef, votre réputation est certainement améliorée.${prompt}
  7865: Cette mission a été émise par la dame d'attente en chef, Zubaba.${prompt}
  7866: Il semble qu'ils aient été impressionnés par vos efforts dans votre mission précédente. Si vous voulez rester dans leurs bonnes grâces, je vous suggère de vous précipiter à Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
  7867: La dame d'attente en chef, Zubaba, vous attend à Tour des Cieux. Veuillez vous y rendre immédiatement !${prompt}
  7868: Si vous accomplissez bien cette mission, cela améliorera certainement votre réputation. Faites du bon travail, vous entendez ?${prompt}
  7869: Les filles tarutaru veulent toutes devenir dames d'attente, vous savez ? Comme quoi, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec elles ?${prompt}
  7870: P-peut-être que c'est similaire au fait que les petites filles mithra passent par une phase où elles veulent toutes devenir Chasseresses du Soleil... je pense.${prompt}
  7871: J'entends dire qu'il y a beaucoup de dames d'attente qui servent la Star Sibylle au deuxième étage de la Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
  7872: On dirait qu'elles font tout le nettoyage, le lavage et la cuisine là-bas. Grrr...${prompt}
  7873: Une mission de Z-Z-Zubaba !?${prompt}
  7874: "Wow! \nVous voulez dire, Zubaba est encore en vie?\nGee...${prompt}"
  7875: Nous avons une convocation formelle de la Tour des Cieux pour vous. Celle-ci, avec un emblème spécial en forme d'étoile, signifie qu'il s'agit officiellement d'une mission de la plus haute importance.${prompt}
  7876: Il est mentionné que vous, ${name-player}, devez “vous rendre au Planétarium de la Tour des Cieux avec une hâte précipitée”. C'est censé être le plus grand honneur qu'un citoyen de Windurst puisse avoir.${prompt}
  7877: Qu'une convocation formelle soit émise de la Tour des Cieux signifie qu'une annonce extrêmement importante sera faite.${prompt}
  7878: Cela signifie aussi que tu n'es plus un simple aventurier, mon ami. Garde tes esprits en alerte ! Nous aimerions t'escorter à ta réunion, mais hélas, nous ne pouvons pas le faire en ce moment.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    Que se passe-t-il ?
    C'est quoi ce truc avec l'emblème étoilé ?
    Je ne comprends pas...je crois.${prompt}
  7880: Miiri-Wohri s'excite tout seul là-bas, tu sais ? Je ne comprends rien du tout !${prompt}
  7881: |-
    Je ne vois pas comment on peut être aussi excité par un morceau de papier. Le papier, c'est quelque chose que même les chèvres mangent.
    Totalement sans valeur !${prompt}
  7882: "...En fait, je dis ça juste parce que je suis jaloux. J'aimerais tellement en avoir un aussi ! C'est trop cool ! \nTu as tellement de chance !${prompt}"
  7883: C'est la première fois que je vois la chose en vrai ! C'est moi qui ai réceptionné la livraison de ton document...alors j'ai pu le toucher !${prompt}
  7884: Wow ! C'est, c'est, c'est comme si j'avais touché la main de la Grande Prêtresse... seulement indirectement ! Wooouuuh ! Je suis tellement heureux d'être en vie !${prompt}
  7885: |-
    Tu n'as pas entendu ?
    Un ordre d'urgence a été émis aux gardes et à quelques aventuriers jugés les plus fidèles à Windurst.${prompt}
  7886: La distribution des missions est suspendue jusqu'à nouvel ordre de la Tour des Cieux. Veuillez patienter jusque-là.${prompt}
  7887: |-
    Tu n'as pas entendu ?
    Un ordre d'urgence a été émis aux gardes et à quelques aventuriers jugés les plus fidèles à Windurst.${prompt}
  7888: La distribution des missions est suspendue jusqu'à nouvel ordre de la Tour des Cieux. Veuillez patienter jusque-là.${prompt}
  7889: Tu as entendu ? Tu as entendu ? Le capitaine Rakoh Buuma a été appelé à l'Académie des Mages, tu sais ?${prompt}
  7890: C'est une situation d'urgence, donc les capitaines de chacune des quatre garnisons ont été convoqués. On dirait qu'ils ont eu une réunion secrète ou quelque chose comme ça...je crois.${prompt} 
  7891: Il semble que quelque chose de grave soit arrivé dans la tour centrale des Ruines de Horutoto.${prompt}
  7892: Semih Lafihna, la garde de la Grande Prêtresse, avait un air sombre sur le visage en courant par ici en route vers les Ruines de Horutoto. Puis elle est revenue un peu plus tard avec un air encore plus en colère !${prompt}
  7893: Mon Dieu ! Windurst est en état d'urgence... J'espère juste qu'il n'est rien arrivé à notre chère Grande Prêtresse !${prompt}
  7894: Si, si quelque chose devait lui arriver, Windurst serait ruinée ! Ce serait au-delà du désespoir !${prompt}
  7895: |-
    C'est une affaire terrifiante !
    Le vent est en tourmente.
    Cela présage que quelque chose de formidable s'est produit !${prompt}
  7896: En des temps comme ceux-ci, tu ne devrais pas prêter l'oreille aux rumeurs des gens. Au lieu de cela, tu devrais entraîner ton esprit à écouter la voix plus grande autour de toi...${prompt}
  7897: |-
    ......
    I sense something peculiar is going on. Something as big as naturrre, yet totally contrary to it, has descended upon these lands...${prompt}
  7898: An emergency mission addressed to you has been issued once again from Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
  7899: You had better hurry to Tour des Cieux and rrreceive your exact orders there. Seems as though you shall be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7900: The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the subject of fairy tales...${prompt}
  7901: Have you rrreceived your exact orders yet? If not, then you had better hurry on over to Tour des Cieux to rrreceive them. Sounds like you'll be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7902: The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the stuff of fairy tales...${prompt}
  7903: What does our trrribal leader think of all this...I wonder?${prompt}
  7904: When the emergency situation arrrose, did the Star Sibyl inform our tribal leader? ...I don't know. I hope Tour des Cieux didn't give our tribal leader the cold shoulder. I'd never forrrgive them for that!${prompt}
  7905: The talisman that disappeared from the Horutoto Ruins was supposed to have been separated between the three countrrries.${prompt}
  7906: Windurst notified the other two countries immediately, so theirrr talismans should be safe. I'm sure they'll up the guard once they've hearrrd what happened.${prompt}
  7907: It, it seems as though the Star Sibyl and her ladies-in-waiting are all safe and soundy-woundy.${prompt}
  7908: B-but I heard that some rogue broke into the Horutoto Ruins. Wasn't the talisman from the Great War of twenty years ago stored there...?${prompt}
  7909: I just rrreceived word that the conference of ministers has ended.${prompt}
  7910: 'Together with that announcement came another ${keyitem-singular: 4[2]} addressed to you. You had better rrrush on over to Tour des Cieux again.${prompt}'
  7911: I've rrreceived word that the conference of ministers has ended.${prompt}
  7912: 'Together with that announcement came ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} addressed to you. You had better rrrush to Tour des Cieux.${prompt}'
  7913: It's extrrremely rare for the five ministries to suddenly hold a meeting, y'know?${prompt}
  7914: It's prrractically impossible to gather the ministers of the five ministries together, so they usually announce these things months in advance...I think.${prompt}
  7915: The situation took a turn for the worrrse there, but it seems all-out warfarrre has been avoided.${prompt}
  7916: Oops...but that was meant to be a secrrret. We're not allowed to tell people about you-know-who being resurrrrected, or how war was about to break out... It would be widespread panic.${prompt}
  7917: I, I heard all sorts of nasty rumors about the meeting of the five ministries, but according to the fortune read by the Star Sibyl, Windurst's future is meant to be bright.${prompt}
  7918: |-
    So, so there's no need to worry.
    There's no way a war will break out.
    You, you can take my word for it!${prompt}
  7919: The ministerrr of the Orastery just went out through that gate, y'know?${prompt}
  7920: Maybe it has something to do with that starrr emblem letter from Tour des Cieux...I think? I wonderrr what is written in those letters?${prompt}
  7921: The situation took a turn for the worrrse there, but it seems all-out warfarrre has been avoided.${prompt}
  7922: Oops...but that was meant to be a secrrret. We're not allowed to tell people about you-know-who being resurrrrected, or how war was about to break out... It would be widespread panic.${prompt}
  7923: I, I had the pleasure of delivering a, a star emblem letter from Tour des Cieux to the Minister of the Manustery, Miss Apururu.${prompt}
  7924: M-Miss Apururu was so pleased, she let slip a little about what's been going on.${prompt}
  7925: I, I'm glad nothing really-weally bad ended up happening. Phew! Makes you appreciate the peace we have now.${prompt}
  7926: You wish to borrow one of our chocobos? Then speak to the choco-gals in front of their steeds. Any disrespect to them will not be tolerated!${prompt}
  7927: |-
    Howdy! I'm a choco-gal!
    I look after the chocobos here.
    Say, have you learned how to ride a chocobo yet?${prompt}
  7928: We want to make sure you know how to handle our chocobos before you try to ride them. Please don't do anything that might damage our cute little chickadees.${prompt}
  7929: Yee-haw! We're the choco-gals--the chicks who look after the chicks, if ya git what I'm sayin'. You heard about us from Quesse, didn'tchya?${prompt}
  7930: Be kweh-reful with our chocobos, y'hear? They maght haive a pretty face, but if ya ruffle thar feathers the wrong way, ya'll be in fer a doozy of a time.${prompt}

    Hidey-dee! I'm a choco-gal from head to toe!

    If how to ride chocobos is what you wanna know,
    then speak to stablemistress Quesse, and get in gear and go!♪${prompt}
  7932: |-
    Our chocobos just love their gysahl greens,
    I like 'em too, they're better than beans!♪
    Remember chocobos ain't no machines,
    so look after 'em, if you know what I means!♪${prompt}
  7933: If at first a chocobo don't take a likin' to ya, then try givin' it its favorrrite food. Why, that's how I tamed this boy herrre!${prompt}
  7934: |-
    Gee-whiz... I don't know...
    Can chocobos fly?
    If they can't, then why do they have wings...?${prompt}
  7935: (Lost in thought on the subject, Matata didn't get any work done today, either...)${prompt}
  7936: Care to spare me an ear for a second, pardnerrr? You see, this one chocobo here hasn't been verrry well lately...${prompt}
  7937: I've got the poorrr thing resting up, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better...${prompt}
  7938: I consulted the apothecary, who said she'd make me her “secret cure-all medicament.”${prompt}
  7939: Yee-haw! Wouldn't that be grrreat, eh? My sick little boy will be all better then, thanks to that!${prompt}
  7940: Seeing as I have to stay and keep an eye on him, I was wonderrring if you would be so neighborly as to go to the Mithra apothecary and see if the medicament is ready or not...${prompt}

  7944: Hurry up and go to the apothecary, y'hearrr? This hyar sick chocobo is sweatin' his tailfeathers off while he's waitin' for that secret cure-all medicament!${prompt}
  7945: Why, that Mithra apothecary is very kind...even though she is a Mithra.${prompt}
  7946: I bet that's her motherly love showing itself. They say a woman changes once she has a child...${prompt}
  7947: You came from the Chocobo Stables, did you? So you're afterrr that secret cure-all of mine, then?${prompt}
  7948: 'The trrruth is, I lack a vital ingredient needed to make that medicament. It''s called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

  7958: Well, thank you for going through all that trrrouble. You've helped us out so verrry much. I'm just glad the little guy doesn't have to suffer much longerrr.${prompt}
  7959: Once my little chocobo friend here is back on his feet again, I intend to spoil him with his favorrrite treat!${prompt}
  7960: I do declare, that sickly chocobo is a bit different from them other chocobos.${prompt}
  7961: 'Why, his favorite meal is not ${item-plural: 2[2]} like normal chocobos, but the stew made by the chef at the Culinarians'' Guild. Isn''t that just the darndest-warndest?${prompt}'

    コックさんは、あったかいシチューを
    作ってあの子に飲ましたんだよ。${prompt}
  7978: Why, if it ain't that special stew...and this chocobo's favorrrite food! Yippee! Why didn't I think of it soonerrr?${prompt}
  7979: |-
    Thank you, pardnerrr!
    I bet if I mix some of that secret cure-all medicament into this stew, he'll gulp it down for surrre!${prompt}
  7980: Wow! Looks like it worked wonderrrs! Yee-haw! Just look at the little guy gobbling down his medicament!${prompt}
  7981: Here's a li'l token of my apprrreciation! Mighty obliged to you again, pardnerrr!${prompt}
  7982: Why, that Ranpi-Monpi's special stew surrre is something, ain't it?${prompt}
  7983: Keep eating it up, boy, 'cause it'll make you well again, okay?${prompt}
  7984: I wonder why that chocobo turned all sickly in the first place? It don't look like no disease I've ever seen...${prompt}
  7985: P'haps he ate something that disagreed with him on one of his journeys? Say, did you know that there's some dang awful mushrooms in them San d'Orian lands?${prompt}
  7986: Why, once you've ate one of the consarned things, you just can't stop and eat more and more! It can git so bad, all you wanna eat's them mushrooms! Darn nasty-wasty work, thems!${prompt}
  7987: |-
    This is the Boneworkers' Guild.
    As the name implies, this is wherrre we craft bone into all mannerrr of goods.${prompt}
  7988: Bone is lightweight but fragile in its naturrral state. Once you've learrrned the Mithra's boneworking methods, however, you'll be able to make weapons that are easy to handle and most effective.${prompt}
  7989: Allo-allo! If you're after boneworking materials, then make sure you buy them herey in Windurst! We're the cheapest in the whole wide worldy!${prompt}
  7990: Well, we're actually the same price as Jeuno...but if you consider how much it costs you to travel-wavel to Jeuno, we're not exactly lying then, are we?${prompt}
  7991: |-
    Oh, that Retto-Marutto...
    If he keeps carrying on while speaking to the customers, he'll get in trouble with the guildmaster again!${prompt}
  7992: Oops, then again, I'd betterrr show you what we've got in stock...${prompt}
  7993: Hidey-ho! This is the Boneworkers' Guild, if you haven't noticed, boneworking was originally a Mithra craft, so that's why there are so many Mithra here!${prompt}
  7994: When animals die, they leave theirrr bones behind. We forrrge their bones into arrowheads and use the arrows to fell other animals. Then when we eat those animals, theirrr bones remain to be used.${prompt}
  7995: It is all one great cycle wherrre nothing goes to waste.${prompt}
  7996: If you want to learn how to craft bone into something useful, then you should study with us here at the Boneworkers' Guild.${prompt}
  7997: It looks as if war is about to break out, so I foresee that we'll be short of hands.${prompt}
  7998: |-
    This is the Weavers' Guild.
    As you can see, skilled craftspeople are busy creataruing all kinds of fabrics, clothes and headwear.${prompt}
  7999: Windurst is famous for its magical cloth! Capes and hoods with all sorts of special properties are made out of such cloth here.${prompt}
  8000: Sew...I mean...“So,” want to get your paws on the top-quality materials as used in the Weaverrrs' Guild?${prompt}
  8001: Then step rrright up and take a look! Just be carrreful not to get too giddy with excitement, now!${prompt}
  8002: If you're interested in buying some works of art from our Weavers' Guild, then you've come to the right placey-wacey.${prompt}
  8003: |-
    We weave our own fabrics here.
    The materials used in our cloths can vary from grub's silk to plant fibers. Why, we even mix such materials together for the best of both worlds!${prompt}
  8004: "Um... \nMaybe it'll work if I do this and then do this... No. That won't do...! Humph...${prompt}"
  8005: You can't make quality fabrics unless you know the strengths and properties of your raw materials. The stockpiling of decades of wisdom is not limited to the realm of magic books, you know!${prompt}
  8006: |-
    I thought I'd learn myself a trade, so I joined the Weavers' Guild as an apprentice.
    They keep me busy day in and day out, but I guess that's how I'll improve.
    After all, they do say “you reap what you sew,” you know?${prompt}
  8007: |-
    This place is hanging by a thread!
    Naw... That was a fabrication! I was trying to pull the wool over your eyes.
    Hahaha... Just being a knitwit!♪${prompt}
  8008: This is the arrrchway to Windurst Walls, the hearrrtland of Windurst.${prompt}
  8009: In the centerrr of Windurst Walls is a giant star tree that grew out of and then encompassed Tour des Cieux. That's where the Star Sibyl, who rules overrr our federation, lives.${prompt}
  8010: Head down this road to get to the harborrr area.${prompt}
  8011: Oh, and if you'rrre planning to board an airship, make sure you get there on time! The airrr travel agency doesn't wait for anyone!${prompt}
  8012: |-
    Arrrgh... I'm soo borrred!
    I wish something would happen to get my hot Mithran blood running again!${prompt}
  8013: 'How I envy adventurerrrs like you. What I''d give to be able to head out into East Sarutabaruta and blow up some ${color: 5}balloons${color: 1} forrr a bit of stress relief!${prompt}'
  8014: Mithra are purrretty good with their hands, you know? Why, we even give the Tarutaru a rrrun for their money! That's why there are so many guild buildings in Windurrrst Woods.${prompt}
  8015: By the way, up this path, you can see the Weaverrrs' Guild. Behind the Weavers' Guild is the Boneworkerrrs' Guild.${prompt}
  8016: If you can't find what you want at Nchaa's Good Goods shop up therrre, then try heading over to street stalls in the Bomingo Round.${prompt}
  8017: You might experience some serendipity therrre. There's one guy at the local restaurant who claims he always makes grrreat finds at those stalls.${prompt}
  8018: We Mithra may live freely, but we know rrright from wrrrong.${prompt}
  8019: That Cat Burglar, Nanaa Mihgo, may think she has everyone fooled with that cute act of hers, but a crrrook is a crrrook! Don't let yourself be taken in by herrr or herrr gang!${prompt}
  8020: Would you shut this little cub up for me? She is too pesky and noisy forrr her own good!${prompt}
  8021: The Sibyl Guards are not real Mithra because they werrre raised by Tarutaru! I don't carrre how strong they are. They've lost the Mithra spirrrit.${prompt}
  8022: Craft skills require you to practice overrr and overrr, wasting many items, until you learn how to synthesize and create things properrrly.${prompt}
  8023: But when you finally can create weapons and other cool stuff that aren't found at the shops, then it finally becomes worrrth all that efforrrt. At the very least, you can show off to your frrriends!${prompt}

    Salut-di-didi !
    Je suis Apururu, la ministre actuelle de ce Manastère et de son atelier de Cardians. Enchantée de faire votre connaissance !${prompt}
  8042: C'est ici que nous insufflons la vie aux gardes automates que nous appelons Cardians.${prompt}
  8043: Vous êtes libre de vous promener, mais nous vous demandons de ne pas enseigner de choses étranges à nos Cardians nouvellement créés !${prompt}
  8044: À vous voir vous balader ici, on dirait bien que vous pensez que ce ministère est une vue inhabituelle.${prompt}
  8045: |-
    Hm ?
    Vous trouvez nos Cardians étranges ? Eh bien, je dirais que c'est plutôt vous qui êtes l'étrange par ici-y-wici !${prompt}
  8046: C'est le Manastère, le ministère chargé de fabriquer et d'entretenir les Cardians. La plupart des gens nous appellent simplement l'“atelier de Cardians”.${prompt}
  8047: Les gardes automates que vous voyez travailler un peu partout à Windurst sont nés et ont grandi ici-même. Vous ne trouvez pas ça un peu incroyable, gamin ?${prompt}
  8048: Je suis encore nouvelle ici, donc ils ne me laissent pas encore aider à créer des Cardians.${prompt}
  8049: Mais j'ai tellement hâte de tester ma force. Je parie que je pourrais créer un Cardian vraiment très fort !${prompt}

  8056: Je pense qu’il a dû être assez seul... Oh, mais merci de nous l'avoir ramené !${prompt}
  8057: J'ai entendu parler de vous, aventurier ! Il semble que vous êtes devenu tout un héros...${prompt}
  8058: Merci d'avoir sauvé Windurst...non...d'avoir sauvé notre monde entier !${prompt}

    Eh bien, bonjour, mon ami !
    Approchez-vous et dites-moi ceci : êtes-vous satisfait de nos Cardians actuels ?${prompt}

    Satisfait des Cardians ?

    Oui, tout à fait.${prompt}

  8064: Eh bien, j'ai exactement ce qu'il vous faut ! Un tout nouveau modèle de Cardian que j'appelle...${prompt}
  8065: |-
    Ta～da～!!!
    "Le tout nouveau C-2000" !${prompt}
  8066: |-
    Alors, qu'en pensez-vous !?
    Avez-vous l'intention de marquer l'histoire de notre nation en aidant à la création de cette incroyable innovation en matière d'automates ?${prompt}
  8067: |-
    Envie de marquer l'histoire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui. Inscrivez-moi maintenant !
    Non, je décline.${prompt}
  8068: |-
    Oh là là...
    Pourquoi devez-vous faire la tête comme ça...?${prompt}
  8069: |-
    Oh, parfait !
    Reste avec moi, gamin--avec mon intelligence et ta force, nous allons sûrement aller loin ensemble !${prompt}
  8070: Vous voyez... J'étais justement en train d'enseigner à “Le Tout-Nouveau C-2000” les odeurs des différents “ennemis”. “Le Tout-Nouveau C-2000” a un meilleur nez que nous autres, vous savez ?${prompt}
  8071: Pour commencer, j'espérais que tu pourrais me rapporter certains des objets que les monstres de Sarutabaruta laissent tomber.${prompt}
  8072: |-
    Laisse-moi voir...
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}...${prompt}
  8073: |-
    Oh, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} serait bien pour commencer.
    Bonne chance et au revoir ! Reviens me voir quand tu auras obtenu un exemplaire de chacun de ces objets...${prompt}
  8074: As-tu obtenu les objets dont j'ai besoin pour éduquer le “Tout-Nouveau C-2000” ?${prompt}
  8075: |-
    N'oublie pas, maintenant...
    J'ai besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  8076: |-
    Alors dépêche-toi, dépê～che-toi !
    Tu ne veux pas que quelqu'un d'autre te devance et que son nom soit inscrit dans l'histoire à ta place, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8077: Les Cardians ne sont pas des gens, tu sais-whow ? Ce sont comme des poupées faites de toutes sortes de matériaux. Nous plaçons la magie sur ces poupées qui leur donne vie.${prompt}
  8078: Mais chaque Cardian est unique. La personnalité de la personne qui lance la magie de vie sur eux se reflète aussi dans leur personnalité !${prompt}
  8079: Les Cardians que Kopuro-Popuro crée causent toutes sortes de problèmes. Nous ne pouvons pas les perdre de vue trop longtemps...${prompt}
  8080: Ministre Apururu est trop indulgente envers lui. L'avenir de notre Manustery est vraiment sombre !${prompt}
  8081: Monsieur Kopuro-Popuro mélange et assortit les sorts magiques qu'il lance sur les Cardians pour les animer.${prompt}
  8082: La magie de vie utilisée sur les Cardians est extrêmement difficile à réaliser. Wow, j'espère que si je continue à m'entraîner assez dur, je pourrai aussi réaliser toutes sortes de variations de cette magie comme il le fait.${prompt}
  8083: Bien obligé à toi, mon ami. Ton nom restera certainement gravé dans l'histoire de Windurst maintenant !${prompt}
  8084: Alors ne te plains pas si ta récompense n'est pas aussi bonne que prévue, gamin.${prompt}
  8085: C'est ainsi que nous apprenons aux Cardians que nous créons à se souvenir de toutes sortes de choses.${prompt}
  8086: Je suppose que c'est un peu comme être leur mère ou leur père.${prompt}
  8087: Hé, tu es revenu ici ?${prompt}
  8088: Eh bien, étant donné que tu es là, autant te rendre utile. Tu vois, je viens de créer un autre nouveau type de Cardian. Cette fois, je l'appelle...${prompt}

    Hein... ?
    Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire par "Ouais, ouais, j'ai déjà entendu ça avant" ?${prompt}

  8092: |-
    Accepter de l'aider ?

    LE SALUT DE SPARE ONE EST...
    QUOOOOOIIIII ?${prompt}
  8100: Ne va pas enseigner ces mots étranges aux enfants Cardians ! C'est pratiquement impossible de faire oublier quelque chose aux Cardians une fois qu'ils l'ont mémorisé !${prompt}
  8101: Ce Cardian Nouveau-né n'est encore qu'un bébé ! Alors il mémorise tout et n'importe quoi sans réserve.${prompt}
  8102: L'autre jour, Kopuro-Popuro est allé enseigner à l'un de nos Kindercardianers les mots "les chapeaux sucent" et cela a beaucoup contrarié le vieux Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
  8103: Les Cardians Nouveau-nés sont comme les enfants ordinaires des gens, alors tu dois leur apprendre à utiliser les mots correctement !${prompt}
  8104: |-
    Hé, toi là-basy !
    Tu te souviens du Cardiany à qui tu as enseigné un salut stupide l'autre jour ?${prompt}
  8105: Ce pauvre Cardiany ne voulait tout simplement pas oublier les mots que tu lui as enseignés.${prompt}
  8106: Puisque c'est toi qui as enseigné une salutation inappropriée à ce pauvre petit, tu devrais assumer tes actions et lui enseigner une manière correcte de saluer les autresy !${prompt}
  8107: Si rien n'est fait, il devra vivre dans l'embarras en tant que Cardian mal formé pour le reste de ses jours. Ne serait-ce pas dommagey ?${prompt}
  8108: |-
    Tu trouves ça pitoyable ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, c'est triste.
    Pas vraiment...${prompt}
  8109: |-
    Brute inhumainy !
    N'as-tu aucun sentimenty ?${prompt}
  8110: Au fur et à mesure que les Cardians grandissent et montent en grade, leurs noms changenty. Ainsi, ce Cardian de rechange à qui tu as parlé alors a maintenant un nom différenty qui correspond au poste qu'il a rempli.${prompt}
  8111: Je crois que son nom est maintenant Cinq de quelque chose...?${prompt}
  8112: |-
    Eh bien, je ne saisy pas...!?
    Leurs noms changenty tellement qu'il est pratiquement impossible de savoir qui est qui !${prompt}
  8113: De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom "Cinq" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}
  8114: Le Cardian dont tu as ruiné la vie en lui enseignant un salut stupide devrait maintenant s'appeler Cinq de quelque chose... ?${prompt}
  8115: De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom "Cinq" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}
  8116: Les Cardians de Windurst reçoivent des numéros dans l'ordre de leur naissance. Lorsque leur prédécesseur numérique tombe en panne, tous les Cardians en dessous montent en grade pour compléter les numéros d'un jeu complet.${prompt}
  8117: Ainsi, plus il y a de Cardians qui deviennent défaillants ou détruits, plus vite les numéros dans les noms de leurs successeurs changent.${prompt}
  8118: Oh, tu veux dire ce Cardian... ? Donc il est déjà devenu le numéro cinq, hein ?${prompt}
  8119: |-
    <Soupir>...
    Quand j'entends cela, je réalise à quel point la durée de vie de nos Cardians devient courte...${prompt}
  8120: Je crois que ce Cardian particulier dont tu parles a été créé par Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt}
  8121: Kopuro-Popuro a l'habitude d'oublier les choses importantes tout en se souvenant toujours des informations les plus inutiles. Tel père, tel fils, hein ?${prompt}
  8122: |-
    Alors, l'as-tu trouvé...?
    Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire, il est à l'extérieury de la ville ? Hein ? Il est si loin de la villey ?${prompt}
  8123: Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery ! Tiens...prends ça comme petit remerciement pour l'avoir retrouvéy !${prompt}
  8124: S'il reste hors de la villey trop longtemps, il y a un risque que les gens le confondent avec l'un de ces Cardians sauvages et le tuenty !${prompt}
  8125: Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery !${prompt}
  8126: S'il reste hors de la villey trop longtemps, il y a un risque que les gens le confondent avec l'un de ces Cardians sauvages et le tuenty !${prompt}
  8127: Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery !${prompt}
  8128: Il est vrai que les numéros par lesquels les Cardians sont appelés changent beaucoup ces derniers temps, mais nous ne devrions pas oublier les étudiants individuels derrière ces noms.${prompt}
  8129: Ce lieu est différent des écoles où l'on enseigne comment étudier. C'est plus comme un foyer où nous élevons les enfants de manière aimantey.${prompt}
  8130: Dis...je me demande si ce Cardian a correctement oublié la ligne “les chapeaux sucent” que je lui ai enseignée ?${prompt}
  8131: Je ne pense pas que nous devrions forcer les Cardians à oublier des choses qu'ils ne veulent pas oublier.${prompt}
  8132: Un peu plus d'individualité ne ferait pas de mal à nos Cardians, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8133: Nous sommes dans de beaux draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
  8134: Nous sommes encore dans le rouge cette semaine.${prompt}
  8135: Et après toutes ces réductions que nous avons mises en place récemment, aussi...${prompt}
  8136: Je voudrais vous demander à tous des idées... Comment pouvons-nous renflouer les caisses du Manustère ?${prompt}
  8137: Je sais, Ministre Apururu ! Il semble que c'est le moment de mettre en œuvre le “Plan B Légendaire” !${prompt}
  8138: Légendaire-waire ?${prompt}
  8139: Plan B ?${prompt}
  8140: Il y a longtemps, notre ancien Manustère faisait face à une crise financière tout comme nous aujourd'hui...${prompt}
  8141: C'était à une époque bien avant que les aéronefs ne connectent les villes de Vana'diel avec le réseau pratique que nous avons maintenant.${prompt}
  8142: À cette époque-là, les voyageurs en route vers Jeuno étaient menacés par des monstres nocturne-wurnes redoutables.${prompt}
  8143: Pour éclaircir l'avenir de ces voyageurs, nos prédécesseurs, dans leur grande sagesse, ont conçu un charme pour les randonneurs appelé le “Gris-gris du Gadabout” !${prompt}
  8144: L'effet de ces charmes était stupéfiant, et la diminution du nombre d'incidents dangereux qui frappaient les voyageurs en direction de Jeuno était significative.${prompt}
  8145: |-
    Hmm... Oh, vraiment ?
    Eh bien, je ne sais pas si c'est vrai ou juste une vieille histoire de grand-mère, mais on pourrait faire une belle somme de gils en vendant de tels charmes aux magasins locaux, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8146: C'était une information très utile, surtout venant de la part de quelqu'un comme Kopuro-Popuro. Alors, comment fabrique-t-on ces "Gadabout's Gris-gris", machin chose ?${prompt}
  8147: Eh bien, il vous faut toutes sortes d'objets que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber quand ils sont vaincus.${prompt}
  8148: 'Pour fabriquer un charme, je pense que nous avons juste besoin de : ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  8149: |-
    Je vois... Génial !
    Alors nous allons en fabriquer une tonne à vendre. Nous aurons de l'argent dans les coffres du Manustery en un rien de temps !${prompt}
  8150: Vous nous aiderez aussi, n'est-ce pas ? S'il vous plaît, récupérez un de chaque objet que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber.${prompt}

    Hmm...
    C'est la première fois que j'entends parler du Plan Légendaire B.${prompt}
  8153: Je ne savais pas que notre ministère était aussi pauvre depuis si longtemps ! Je ne sais pas si je devrais m'en réjouir ou sombrer encore plus dans la dépression...${prompt}
  8154: Alors... je me demande combien de ces machins "Gadabout's Gris-gris" nous devons fabriquer pour remettre notre budget à flot.${prompt}
  8155: Eh bien, les finances ne sont pas mon souci, alors je vais simplement me concentrer sur la fabrication des marchandises. Je continuerai à fabriquer des "Gadabout's Gris-gris" jusqu'à ce que nous tombions tous d'épuisement.${prompt}
  8156: Nous avons décidé de continuer avec notre Plan Légendaire B -- fabriquer et vendre des charmes spéciaux qui protègent les gens qui voyagent la nuit.${prompt}
  8157: Le meilleur, c'est qu'ils ne nécessitent aucune magie spéciale -- tant que nous avons les bons matériaux, ils sont faciles à fabriquer !${prompt}
  8158: 'Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... On dirait que nous avons tout !${prompt}'

    Voici votre part...
    Beau travail, mon p'tit !${prompt}
  8160: Nous sommes dans de sales draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
  8161: Nous avons des montagnes de stock invendu ! Cela signifie des montagnes de dettes !${prompt}
  8162: Dernièrement, les aventuriers ont réduit les monstres nocturnes à des niveaux contrôlables, donc voyager la nuit n'est plus aussi dangereux qu'avant. Cela signifie que nos charmes ne se vendent pas du tout !${prompt}
  8163: J'arrête le Plan Légendaire B. Maintenant, je dois calculer combien de rouge nous sommes après cette idée saugrenue !${prompt}
  8164: Tenez... Je vous en donne aussi un. Sortez-moi cette bêtise de ma vue !${prompt}
  8165: |-
    <Soupir>...
    Je sais, je sais... pas besoin de me le dire. J'aurais dû réaliser que c'était une idée stupide plus tôt...${prompt}

    Je ne comprends pas...
    Qu'est-ce qui n'a pas fonctionné avec le Plan Légendaire B ?${prompt}
  8167: Je sais... Je parie que quelqu'un s'est délibérément efforcé de saboter mon plan ! Oui, c'est ça. Quelqu'un a dû employer des aventuriers pour sortir et chasser les monstres nocturnes.${prompt}
  8168: Cela montre bien que si l'on a les doigts dans plusieurs tartes, on risque de se brûler les doigts...${prompt}
  8169: C'était une bonne leçon sur la nature des affaires. Il y a des pièges dans la diversification après tout.${prompt}

    La reine a eu une vie heureuse...

    Enfin bon, aventurier...
    Vous avez sûrement beaucoup voyagé dans le monde et vu beaucoup de choses tristes vous-même.${prompt}

  8187: Peu importe combien de fois vous le vivez, dire nos derniers adieux à nos petits Cardians est une chose douloureuse.${prompt}
  8188: <sniff> C'est d'autant plus douloureux quand c'est un Cardian que vous avez donné vie et élevé de vos propres mains. <sob> Waaah !${prompt}
  8189: Le Cardian qui est mort tout à l'heure était celui que la ministre Apururu a élevé personnellement...${prompt}
  8190: Ce Cardian a pu revenir ici avec sa force restante, mais je crains que la Reine de Carreau n'ait pas été aussi chanceuse...${prompt}
  8191: Même si nous trouvons seulement une de ses parties, au moins nous pourrons lui donner une sépulture digne...${prompt}
  8192: |-
    Quoi...?
    Elle vous offre ${number: 1} gils pour retrouver notre Cardian disparu ? C'est exactement ce genre de stupidités qui nous plonge encore plus dans le rouge !${prompt}
  8193: Si ce Cardian est en route vers ici, cela signifie seulement qu'il est sur le point de passer l'arme à gauche, non ?${prompt}
  8194: Alors pourquoi payer un prix aussi élevé pour retrouver quelque chose d'aussi inutile ?${prompt}
  8195: C'est comme, pourquoi dépenser autant d'argent pour des sentiments personnels stupides, alors que mettre cet argent pour créer un nouveau Cardian est dans l'intérêt de tous ?${prompt}
  8196: Désolé, mais cette fois-ci je vais devoir le dire à notre ministre sans détours !${prompt}
  8197: Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}
  8198: D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous pleurez quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
  8199: Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}

  8208: Oh, c'est sans valeur. Une telle poubelle mérite d'être jetée dans la poubelle.${prompt}
  8209: Oh, je vois que vous avez trouvé un morceau d'elle, hein ? Cette noix est en effet une partie de ce qui était autrefois la grande Reine de Carreau.${prompt}
  8210: Sa marque est effacée, mais je reconnais une maison de diamant quand je vois ça. Voyez-vous, c'est moi qui fabrique les Cardians de Diamants, vous savez ?${prompt} 
  8211: Mais je n'ai pas l'intention de vous payer un seul gil ! C'est toujours une poubelle sans valeur, même si c'était l'un des miens. Je suis différent de la ministre Apururu, vous voyez. Je ne laisse pas mes sentiments interférer avec mon travail...${prompt}
  8212: |-
    ...Hein ?
    Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça...?${prompt}

  8218: Non, je ne suis pas devenu tout émotif, vous savez ! C’était juste une poupée à laquelle nous avons insufflé temporairement la vie, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8219: D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous allez pleurer quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
  8220: 'Boizo-Naizo a-t-il vraiment donné ${number: 2} gils tout à l’heure ?${prompt}'
  8221: Je ne sais pas d’où vient une telle somme, car notre Manustère n’a certainement pas ça à gaspiller... Ah !${prompt}
  8222: C'est vrai, il disait juste qu'il avait enfin économisé assez de gils pour acheter la dernière création de chapeau du chapelier ! Vous ne pensez pas qu'il a utilisé cet argent pour vous payer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8223: Les Cardians sont des formes de vie nées en empruntant le pouvoir des étoiles. Ils sont tout comme nous, des êtres dotés d'une force vitale qui descend des cieux.${prompt}
  8224: |-
    C'est pourquoi nous ne devrions jamais oublier...
    La force vitale d'un Cardian n'est pas quelque chose que nous avons créé. Nous avons simplement appelé ce pouvoir sur terre.${prompt}
  8225: C'est pourquoi nous devrions envoyer cette vie lorsqu'elle quitte la terre, en lui disant que nous espérons nous retrouver.${prompt}
  8226: |-
    De la glace en forme de larme...
    De la glace qui n'a pas fondu jusqu'à ce qu'elle touche les mains de Boizo-Naizo... Il y a beaucoup de mystères inexplicables dans ce monde.${prompt}
  8227: |-
    Dis...
    Je me demande si les Cardians peuvent pleurer ? Il n'y a aucun dispositif intégré en eux pour leur permettre de le faire, cependant...${prompt}
  8228: |-
    Haw ! Ouais, c'est ça !
    J'm'occupe tout seul de ces dhalmels ici, tu sais ! Pourquoi, t'as un problème avec ça, hein ?${prompt}
  8229: |-
    Oh, et tant que vous êtes ici...
    Ne taquinez pas trop les pauvres bêtes, d'accord ! Pas si vous savez ce qui est bon pour vous !${prompt}

  8233: 'Si vous en tuez assez pour mettre la main sur trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} ou ${item-plural: 3[2]}, je vous donnerai quelque chose en récompense ! Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}'

    Je vois...
    Alors, vous vous fichez de ce qui arrive à mes dhalmels, c'est ça ? Espèce de lâcheur de rampants à rayures jaunes !${prompt}
  8236: Les rampants peuvent être trouvés à la fois dans l'Est et l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta. Donc, exterminez autant de ces sales bestioles que possible dans ces deux parties.${prompt}
  8237: 'Les rampants sont hors de contrôle, et je suis à bout ! Tuez suffisamment de ces bestioles pour mettre la main sur trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} ou ${item-plural: 3[2]}, et je vous paierai une récompense !${prompt}'
  8238: Les rampants peuvent être trouvés à la fois dans l'Est et l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta. Donc, exterminez autant de ces sales bestioles que possible dans ces deux parties.${prompt}

    Merci bien, mon ami !
    On dirait que tu as vraiment éliminé un bon nombre de ces satanés rampants. Voici ta récompense ! Merci beaucoup à toi.${prompt}
  8240: 'Si jamais tu as le temps, pourrais-tu avoir la gentillesse d’en tuer encore quelques-uns de ces satanés rampants pour moi ? Tue suffisamment de ces bestioles pour mettre la main sur trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} ou ${item-plural: 3[2]}, et je te paierai une belle récompense !${prompt}'
  8241: Tu as vu ces tours là-bas à Sarutabaruta, hein ? Elles sont appelées les Ruines de Horutoto. Une fois qu'elles sont tombées en ruine, les animaux de Sarutabaruta ont commencé à courir partout, tu sais ?${prompt}
  8242: J'ai pas beaucoup d'idée à quoi servaient ces tours, mais elles étaient certainement magiques. Je me demande si un jour elles pourront les réparer ?${prompt}
  8243: Dans la nature, rien n'est sans but... rien n'est gaspillé. Toi et moi sommes ici pour une raison.${prompt}
  8244: On ne devrait jamais gaspiller les cadeaux de la nature, et ne jamais prendre une vie, aussi petite soit-elle, sans cause justifiée. C'est le code de la chasse que nous, rangers, sommes tenus de respecter.${prompt}
  8245: S'il te plaît, ne nous dérange pas maintenant. Nous sommes en train d'offrir nos prières pour une grande chasse.${prompt}
  8246: Nous, rangers, devons montrer notre gratitude pour les bénédictions de la nature pendant que nous menons la chasse. Car nous aussi, nous faisons partie du grand dessein de Mère Nature...${prompt}
  8247: As-tu déjà réfléchi à la manière dont la nourriture que tu manges chaque jour arrive sur ton assiette ?${prompt}
  8248: Oui. Quand nous mourrons, nous aussi serons mangés par quelqu'un ou quelque chose. En fin de compte, nous retournons tous à la terre pour servir de nutriments à d'autres êtres vivants.${prompt}
  8249: Tu entres dans la présence de la Cheftaine Perih Vashai, celle qui unifie les Mithra de Windurst.${prompt}
  8250: En vérité, elle est l'héroïne Mithra qui manie la flèche cramoisie et l'arc azuré. Sois prudent, de peur d'être submergé par sa vigueur pacifique.${prompt}
  8251: Béni soit celui avec les marées cramoisies inondant son sein et la lueur azur émanant de ses yeux.${prompt}
  8252: Car seul un tel individu peut hériter de l'arc et de la flèche de la cheftaine.${prompt}
  8253: J'ai amené ma fille ici pour rencontrer la cheftaine tribale, et pour que son altesse voie à quel point l'enfant grandit.${prompt}
  8254: La cheftaine a inculqué à ma fille l'esprit Mithra - les enseignements d'un peuple en harmonie avec la nature. C'est exactement ce que ma mère a fait pour moi.${prompt}
  8255: Tu veux savoir pourquoi la cheftaine garde toujours ses yeux fermés ?${prompt}
  8256: C'est pour qu'elle puisse mieux entendre la voix de la nature !${prompt}
  8257: |-
    As-tu entendu, aventurier ?
    Notre monde est à nouveau en émoi.${prompt}
  8258: Nous sommes sur la voie des grandes guerres et du répandage de beaucoup de sang. Si ces temps viennent vraiment, je serai forcé de transmettre l'arc de la cheftaine à une Mithra qui aura trouvé une nouvelle voie à parcourir, une qui a de nouveaux rêves pour son peuple.${prompt}
  8259: Nous avons reçu des nouvelles de Rakoh Buuma, capitaine de la porte est.${prompt}
  8260: Nous avons peur que ce soit plutôt de mauvaises nouvelles. Rien de bon n'arrive les jours où le vent souffle chaud.${prompt}
  8261: Ce que nous craignons est sur le point de se produire n'est en aucun cas certain. Cependant, si nos pires craintes se réalisent, alors nous aurons besoin d'une cheftaine forte capable de lever les terres et de diriger nos armées.${prompt}
  8262: Nous ne pouvons pas demander cela à notre cheftaine âgée. Aurons-nous besoin de choisir un nouveau leader même lorsque notre cheftaine actuelle est toujours en vie... ?${prompt}
  8263: As-tu entendu, aventurier ? Il semble qu'il y ait eu une grande bataille loin dans les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8264: J'imagine que le monde va se calmer un moment maintenant. Cependant, les cœurs des Mithra continueront à tambouriner, car nous, Mithra, savons que rien n'a vraiment pris fin du tout.${prompt}
  8265: Pourquoi ? Pourquoi mon cœur ne se calme-t-il pas ?${prompt}
  8266: Eh bien ! La cheftaine semble percevoir quelque chose. Que va-t-il se passer ensuite ?${prompt}
  8267: Personne ne veut le dire à voix haute, mais nous sentons tous que quelque chose est sur le point de se produire.${prompt}
  8268: C'était exactement la même chose il y a vingt ans. Il y avait un grand sentiment de perte à l'époque, comme si une grande présence avait soudainement disparu. Mais qu'était-ce qui était perdu ?${prompt}
  8269: Dans la nature, rien n'est sans but... rien n'est gaspillé. Toi et moi sommes ici pour une raison.${prompt}
  8270: On ne devrait jamais gaspiller les cadeaux de la nature, et ne jamais prendre une vie, aussi petite soit-elle, sans cause justifiée. C'est le code de la chasse que nous, rangers, sommes tenus de respecter.${prompt}
  8271: As-tu, mon enfant, foulé de nombreuses terres, bu de nombreuses pluies, combattu de nombreuses batailles et vécu pour voir de nombreux aurores ?${prompt}
  8272: Alors je te le dis en vérité, à moins que tu ne sois approuvé par la terre et le ciel, comment peux-tu dire que tu es accepté par Mère Nature ?${prompt}
  8273: Si tu désires te soumettre aux lois de la nature, mon enfant, alors va, rencontre le roi denté des bêtes et ramène une de ses grandes dents.${prompt}
  8274: Écoute la voix de la nature et attends que la nature suive son cours. Si la nature nous accepte, alors même nous qui manquons de crocs seront autorisés à chasser comme ses rangers.${prompt}
  8275: Mon enfant, si tu désires te soumettre aux lois de la nature, alors va, rencontre le roi denté des bêtes et ramène une de ses grandes dents.${prompt}
  8276: Écoute la voix de la nature et attends que la nature suive son cours. Si la nature nous accepte, alors même nous qui manquons de crocs seront autorisés à chasser comme ses rangers.${prompt} 
  8277: Le roi denté des bêtes est l'un des grands tigres. C'est un monstre redoutable avec des pieds rapides et une puissance impressionnante. Ses dents sont très légères mais extrêmement solides, parfaites pour fabriquer les meilleures pointes de flèches.${prompt}
  8278: Depuis longtemps, ils habitent sur la Plaine Sauromugue, et nous avons beaucoup appris d'eux.${prompt}
  8279: Qu'est-ce que tu veux apprendre de nous, le peuple de la nature ?${prompt}
  8280: Tandis que vous dites vouloir laisser un héritage pour l'avenir, vous pillez tout ce que vous pouvez ici et maintenant.${prompt}
  8281: Si vous vous arrêtiez un moment et réfléchissiez, vous vous rendriez compte qu'à ce rythme, vous n'aurez rien laissé à vos descendants.${prompt}
  8282: Ceux qui disent vouloir laisser un héritage pour l'avenir, tout en pillant tout ce qu'ils peuvent ici et maintenant, vivent à l'encontre de la nature.${prompt}
  8283: S'ils s'arrêtaient un instant et réfléchissaient, ils se rendraient compte qu'à ce rythme, ils n'auront rien laissé à leurs descendants.${prompt}
  8284: Pourquoi, mon enfant, as-tu causé encore une autre des merveilles de la nature à mourir de manière insignifiante ? Il est inutile d'essayer d'expliquer cette signification de croc à quelqu'un comme toi.${prompt}
  8285: Pour le chasseur, les crocs ne sont pas seulement un outil vital pour l'existence, mais aussi un témoin de sa mort. Si celui aux crocs perd ses crocs, il ne peut plus vivre. Pourtant, quand celui aux crocs meurt, seuls ses crocs restent.${prompt}
  8286: Pour chasser comme celui aux crocs, tu dois vivre par le croc et mourir en ne laissant que le croc derrière toi.${prompt}
  8287: À toi, notre nouveau ranger, je te confie le témoin de la vie et de la mort du grand celui aux crocs...${prompt}
  8288: Désormais, tu peux devenir un ranger !${prompt}
  8289: Celle à qui Mère Nature a conféré ses crocs ne doit jamais se battre sans raison.${prompt}
  8290: Gloire aux crocs de celui aux crocs. Écoute la voix de la nature et suis son cours. Le ciel et la terre te diront quand combattre et quand mourir.${prompt}
  8291: Pourquoi penses-tu que les gens ont perdu leurs crocs ? Peut-être parce que les gens ont arrêté d'écouter la voix de la nature.${prompt}
  8292: Cette arme que tu tiens dans tes mains n'est qu'une manifestation temporaire d'un croc. Tes vrais crocs existent dans ton cœur !${prompt}
  8293: Il n'y a pas de vies sans signification dans ce monde, mais il y a un grand nombre de morts sans signification.${prompt}
  8294: |-
    N'oublie jamais, celui aux crocs...
    N'oublie jamais la faute et la folie de causer une mort inutile.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Hé ! Que veux-tu ?
    Ne me dis pas...${prompt}

    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  8298: Oh, donc tu essaies juste de flirter avec moi, hein ? Désolé, mais je ne suis intéressé ni par les hommes ni par les femmes. La seule chose qui fait battre mon cœur, ce sont les traces et les déjections de ma prochaine proie de chasse, merci.${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Je le savais !
    Très bien alors. Ça ne me dérange pas de te le montrer. Après tout, je suis un chasseur de premier ordre, donc je n'en ai pas vraiment besoin.${prompt}
  8300: On m'a donné ce parchemin il y a quelques années par un vieil Elvaan mal dégrossi. Je l'ai aidé quand je l'ai trouvé perdu dans les bois, et c'était sa façon de me rendre la pareille.${prompt}
  8301: Pour tout te dire, je n'étais pas tellement intéressé, alors je n'ai pas fait beaucoup attention à son explication et j'ai presque tout oublié de ce qu'il a dit.${prompt}
  8302: C'était quelque chose à propos de comment les différents types de monstres se mangent les uns les autres pour survivre, alors je suppose qu'il essayait de me dire de me référer à ce schéma quand je chasse.${prompt}
  8303: Mais chaque fois que je repère un monstre, je deviens complètement obsédé par la pensée de la chasse et j'oublie tout conseil et ce diagramme.${prompt}
  8304: Peut-être suffit-il de garder cette connaissance enfouie quelque part dans un coin de ton esprit, au cas où tu en aurais besoin. Mais si tu veux en savoir plus, alors il faudra juste que tu retrouves ce vieil homme.${prompt}
  8305: Tu es le bienvenu pour jeter un autre coup d'œil à ce diagramme quand tu veux. C'est pénible de l'expliquer à chaque personne qui le demande, mais peut-être que c'est une sorte de destin... En fait, j'ai découvert que j'apprécie aider les gens.${prompt}

    Tu es citoyen de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ?
    Alors pas de problème. Tu devrais déjà avoir une Maison Mog préparée pour toi en haut des escaliers ici.${prompt}

  8324: Laissez-moi voir... Vous n'êtes pas citoyen de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ? Dans ce cas, voulez-vous que je prépare une chambre à louer pour vous ici ?${prompt}
  8325: Lorsque vous louez une chambre à louer ici, vous pouvez l'utiliser comme votre propre Maison Mog personnelle dans votre pays d'origine. Plutôt pratique, non ?${prompt}
  8326: |- 
      Louer une chambre à louer ?
      ${selection-lines}
      Oui.
      Non.${prompt}
  8327: "Ho-hum... ho-hum... Voilà, tout est réglé. Vous avez maintenant votre propre chambre à louer prête pour votre usage dans la zone résidentielle de Windurst derrière moi. Bon séjour.${prompt}"
  8328: Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec vous ? Pourquoi restez-vous là à rêvasser ?${prompt}
  8329: Hmm... Vous vous appelez aventurier ? Je suppose que si on étire assez l'imagination, on pourrait presque le croire.${prompt}
  8330: Permettez-moi de deviner que c'est votre première fois à Windurst.${prompt}
  8331: |- 
      Première fois à Windurst ?
      ${selection-lines}
      Oui.
      Non.${prompt}
  8332: |- 
      Eh bien alors, bienvenue...
      Oui, bienvenue dans la paisible vieille Windurst. Les peureux qui ont été endormis par la paix sont accueillis avec enthousiasme ici.${prompt}
  8333: |- 
      Bon essai...
      Mais si vous allez tromper les gens, vous devriez au moins apprendre à mentir correctement.${prompt}
  8334: |- 
      Où allez-vous ?
      Qu'est-ce qui vous amène en ville ?${prompt}
  8335: |- 
      Que voulez-vous faire maintenant ?
      ${selection-lines}
      Sortir et combattre.
      Faire du shopping.
      Rassembler des informations.
      Où suis-je ? Qui suis-je ?${prompt}
  8336: Grrr... Tu es plus ardent que tu n'en as l'air. Je pourrais presque bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
  8337: Mais à en juger par ton apparence délicate, je dirais que tu serais chanceux de battre un rarab, encore moins une mandragore, là-bas à Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8338: Oh, au cas où tu ne le saurais pas, Sarutabaruta est le nom des plaines qui entourent Windurst.${prompt}
  8339: Si tu remontes cette pente derrière toi et que tu passes par la porte, tu arriveras à l'est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8340: Sarutabaruta est plein de monstres faibles, donc même un débutant comme toi peut essayer de chasser là-bas.${prompt}
  8341: |-
      Mais sois averti.
      Plus tu t'éloignes de la ville, plus les monstres deviennent forts, alors garde un œil sur ta carte.${prompt}
  8342: Demande à tes camarades aventuriers pour des détails sur la meilleure façon de combattre ou de fuir. Je ne vais pas me donner la peine de te le dire moi-même.${prompt}
  8343: Eh bien, j'ai assez aidé pour aujourd'hui. Je suis sûr que tu as compris l'idée.${prompt}
  8344: La leçon de Nanaa Mihgo sur Windurst est terminée. J'ai réduit tes frais de scolarité à seulement 1000 gils. Allez, paie.${prompt}
  8345: |-
      Payer les frais de scolarité ?
      ${selection-lines}
      Pas question !
      Bon, euh, d'accord...${prompt}
  8346: Quoi !? Tu ne me paieras même pas un simple compliment, malgré mon aimable assistance !? Ne connais-tu pas l'étiquette élémentaire de l'aventurier ?${prompt}
  8347: Montre-moi ce que tu as dans ta bourse.${prompt}
  8348: Tu saisis vite, gamin. Je commence à penser que je pourrais bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
  8349: Arrête-toi là !${prompt}
  8350: |-
      Nanaa Mihgo !!!
      Tu continues tes vieux tours pour escroquer les voyageurs de leur gil durement gagné, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8351: Nous, la “Brigade des Étoiles d'Oignon”, ne te laisserons pas t'en sortir comme ça !${prompt}
  8352: |-
      Grrr, pas ces S.O.B. encore !
      J'aurais réussi à m'en sortir, si ce n'était pour vous, gamins intrusifs !${prompt}
  8353: En raison de ce dérangement, je vais devoir mettre fin à ta leçon pour aujourd'hui !${prompt}
  8354: Nous continuerons un autre jour, et c'est là que je collecterai mes frais.${prompt}
  8355: |-
      Hé, elle s'enfuit !
      Après elle !${prompt}
  8356: Hé～y, ne cours pas si vite !${prompt}
  8357: <Soupir>......${prompt}
  8358: Ce mithwa est un vilain mithwa que nous appelons tous le Voleur de Chats.${prompt}
  8359: Si tu as besoin d'une vraie aide, dirige-toi vers la fontaine. Jack of Spades est en poste là-bas. Il t'enseignera tout ce que tu as besoin de savoir. Consulte la “Carte” pour trouver le chemin jusqu'à là-bas.${prompt}
  8360: |-
    Oh, et donnez ça à Jack.
    Vous pouvez le lui remettre en utilisant l'option « Échanger » du menu principal.${prompt}
  8361: Ah, nous avons oublié de nous présenter. Nous sommes la Brigade de l'Oignon Étoilé ! Nous sommes les protecteurs d'un avenir plus brillant ! Ça vaut la peine de se souvenir de nous !${prompt}
  8362: |-
    Quoi... ? Faire des achats ?
    Me poser la question est une perte de temps.${prompt}
  8363: Je veux dire une perte de mon temps, pas du vôtre ! Si vous devez demander, alors tout ce que je peux recommander, c'est de vous diriger vers le port de Windurst.${prompt}
  8364: Pour y aller, suivez la route de l'autre côté de cette fontaine.${prompt}
  8365: Une fois au port, descendez vers les quais, où il y a trois boutiques en forme de bateau. Elles abritent une boutique de magie, une boutique d'armures et une boutique d'armes.${prompt} 
  8366: Si vous cherchez des boutiques dans la région du Bois de Windurst, il y a un magasin de produits généraux tout au fond, de l'autre côté de ces tentes là-bas. Vous trouverez aussi les boutiques de la Guilde des Travailleurs de l'Os et de la Guilde des Tisserands derrière là-bas !${prompt}
  8367: Et derrière la ferme de dhalmel, il y a une apothicaire mithra.${prompt}
  8368: Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais vous pouvez gagner de l'argent en vendant les objets que les monstres laissent tomber après les avoir vaincus. Vous pouvez utiliser l'argent gagné pour acheter ce que vous voulez.${prompt}
  8369: Le meilleur moyen de recueillir des informations est de parler à tous les habitants de la ville.${prompt}
  8370: Aujourd'hui, je vais vous donner quelques informations spéciales gratuitement... mais juste cette fois. Quel type d'information vous intéresse particulièrement ?${prompt}
  8371: |-
    Demander des informations sur... ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aider les gens.
    Patrouille contre les monstres.
    Facile à gagner.
    Recherche de travail.${prompt}
  8372: Pourquoi ne pas essayer l'atelier Cardian du Manustery là-haut ? Vous n'aiderez pas seulement les gens, mais aussi les Cardians.${prompt}
  8373: Oh, les Cardians sont les automates magiques qui fonctionnent comme les gardes de Windurst.${prompt}
  8374: Si vous entrez dans cet atelier là-bas, vous en verrez plus que vous ne le voudriez probablement.${prompt}
  8375: Personnellement, je préférerais que tous les Cardians soient rassemblés et détruits.${prompt}
  8376: Hah ! S'il y avait autant de belles promesses de gains rapides, je l'aurais déjà fait.${prompt}
  8377: |-
    Mais attendez une seconde.
    Laissez-moi voir... Qu'est-ce qui pourrait convenir à un débutant comme vous... ?${prompt}
  8378: Connaissez-vous la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os au sud d'ici ? Si vous pratiquez assidûment ce métier, vous pourriez gagner de l'argent en synthétisant et en vendant des objets.${prompt}
  8379: Vous ne deviendrez pas riche du jour au lendemain, mais c'est un moyen relativement facile de gagner de l'argent. Eh bien, c'est un début, non ?${prompt}
  8380: 'Normalement, je dirais : « Allez massacrer ces Yagudo ! »${prompt}'
  8381: Mais les Tarutaru de Windurst préfèrent maintenir la paix et essaient d'être amis avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
  8382: À ce stade, tout ce que je peux vous recommander, c'est la ferme de dhalmel.${prompt}
  8383: Si vous partez vers le nord à partir d'ici, vous verrez les longs cous des dhalmel dépassant de la passerelle de la ferme. Renseignez-vous auprès du fermier. Elle est reconnaissante pour toute aide.${prompt}
  8384: Vous cherchez du travail, hein ? Alors rendez-vous à l'une des guérites.${prompt}
  8385: Il y en a une juste derrière vous. Le bâtiment en pierre là-bas est la Guérite Est. Elle est grouillante de ces gardes Mithra qui se pavanent.${prompt}
  8386: Vous pouvez recevoir des missions des guérites si vous aimez vous porter volontaire pour votre pays. Personnellement, ça ne m'intéresse pas beaucoup, alors demandez des détails à la guérite.${prompt}
  8387: Les missions sont des tâches de et pour le compte de la Fédération de Windurst, et diffèrent des demandes d'aide des habitants ordinaires.${prompt}
  8388: Par exemple, si vous accomplissez une mission, vous recevez un certain nombre de points de rang.${prompt}
  8389: Accumulez suffisamment de points de rang et votre rang ou votre position dans ce pays augmentera. Mais pour ce qui me concerne, les récompenses ne valent pas l'effort.${prompt}
  8390: Hein ? Vous ne savez pas où vous mettez les pieds ? Pauvre de vous.${prompt}
  8391: Nous sommes dans les Bois de Windurst, le district le plus à l'est des quatre districts de Windurst.${prompt}
  8392: Comme nous sommes près du Bomingo Round ici, je vais l'utiliser comme point de départ pour mon explication.${prompt}
  8393: Tout d'abord, si vous partez vers le sud depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez plusieurs boutiques tenues par les artisanes locales.${prompt}
  8394: Il y a la Guilde des Tisserands, qui est la spécialité des Tarutaru, et il y a la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os, qui est plus le domaine des Mithra. Ce sont la fierté et la joie de Windurst.${prompt}
  8395: Si vous partez vers le nord depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez des routes menant à la ferme de dhalmel et aux Écuries de Chocobos. Suivez simplement l'agréable odeur de la nature.${prompt}
  8396: Prenez la route vers le nord, et vous trouverez une apothicaire mêlée parmi les bosquets Mithra avec les maisons Mithra. Prenez la route vers le sud, et vous trouverez une maison de vente aux enchères.${prompt}
  8397: Comparé aux autres districts, il n'y a presque pas de bâtiments Tarutaru dans les Bois de Windurst du tout. Cependant, le Manustery, l'un des cinq ministères, est juste là-bas.${prompt}
  8398: Ce bâtiment là-haut est l'atelier Cardian du Manustery. C'est là que sont fabriqués ces gardes Cardian.${prompt}
  8399: Enfin, en partant vers l'ouest depuis le rond-point, vous arriverez à la zone résidentielle de Windurst.${prompt}
  8400: Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, vous pouvez utiliser l'une des Maisons Mog à l'intérieur de là-bas.${prompt}
  8401: Demandez aux gardes à l'entrée pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8402: |-
    Eh bien bonjour, aventurier.
    J'ai un petit problème énigmatique que vous pourriez peut-être m'aider à résoudre...${prompt}

  8404: J’ai entendu dire que ses précédents propriétaires ont tous vécu les événements les plus bizarres.${prompt}
  8405: J’ai essayé de me débarrasser de ce fichu truc, mais il revient toujours vers moi. Alors... je me demandais si vous pouviez faire quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant que je ne devienne complètement folle.${prompt}
  8406: |-
    Aider Roberta avec son ruban ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accepter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  8407: Ne me dites pas que vous avez peur ! Vous aviez l'air du genre à pouvoir aider une vieille dame.${prompt}
  8408: J'ai presque peur de vous impliquer dans cette affaire, mais merci d'avoir accepté de m'aider. Manipulez-le avec précaution, maintenant...${prompt}
  8409: Eh bien re-bonjour, aventurier. J'ai toujours ce petit problème énigmatique auquel vous étiez censé m'aider...${prompt}
  8410: 'Vous vous souvenez de ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné ? Eh bien, par hasard, l’auriez-vous perdu ?${prompt}'

    Je le savais ! Je le savais !
    Vous ne me croirez jamais, mais ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné est revenu vers moi encore une fois !${prompt}
  8413: S'il vous plaît. Je vous en prie. Faites quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant qu'il ne me rende folle !${prompt} 
  8414: "Vraiment ? \nHmm... Peu importe alors...${prompt}"
  8415: |-
    Hé ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame]...
    Allez-vous me ramener chez moi...?${prompt}
  8416: Ce ruban n'est pas à vendre, et je ne le rachèterais certainement pas à qui que ce soit. Pourtant, il parvient toujours à revenir ici vers moi. Que se passe-t-il... ?${prompt}
  8417: Ce ruban n'est pas à vendre, et je ne le rachèterais certainement pas à qui que ce soit. Pourtant, il parvient toujours à revenir ici vers moi. Que se passe-t-il... ?${prompt}
  8418: Vous n'avez pas besoin de me dire quoi que ce soit sur l'histoire de ce ruban. Je ne veux pas savoir.${prompt}
  8419: Dans ce monde étrange qui est le nôtre, certaines choses sont mieux laissées inconnues.${prompt}
  8420: Alors... vous m'avez trouvé, hein ? Oui, je sais, je sais. Ne me dites pas--notre éditeur, le vieux Naiko-Paneiko, est tout excité de vouloir que nous lâchions nos scoops d'information, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
  8421: Hmm... Que devrais-je faire ? Vous voyez, j'ai un super scoop, mais je n'ai pas pu confirmer s'il est vraiment vrai ou nonaru.${prompt}
  8422: Alors je pourrais simplement vous laisser le prendre et le lui rapporter, mais une bonne reporter devrait toujours vérifier ses sources, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
  8423: Dites, peut-être pourriez-vous vérifier mon histoire et aller voir si les faits concordent avant de le soumettre à notre éditeuraru ? Peut-être pourriez-vous aussi obtenir l'aide de quelques autres aventuriers pour vous aider et servir de témoins... ?${prompt}
  8424: Pour terminer votre travail en confirmant mon scoop d'information, dirigez-vous vers les profondeurs de la tour de magie orientale et découvrez si le repaire du Voleur de Chats existe vraiment là-basaru.${prompt}
  8425: Je ne vous suggère pas d'entrer réellement dans son repaire, car le Voleur de Chats est sûr d'avoir des pièges dangereux et des gardes là-bas. Trouvez simplement l'entrée du lieu à l'arrière des Ruines de Horutoto... puis sortez de là au plus vite !${prompt}
  8426: Je le savais ! Mes sources avaient raisonaru ! Filez vite voir mon éditeur avec le scoop avant que quelqu'un d'autre ne nous devance !${prompt}
  8427: Le prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer de cette année pour le journalisme est dans ma poche, c'est sûr ! Je m'assurerai de vous remercier dans mon discours de remerciement !${prompt}
  8428: |-
    Le Voleur de Chats... ?
    Oh, vous voulez dire Nanaa Mihgo ?
    Bien sûr que je la connais !${prompt}
  8429: On dit que les trésors qu'elle vole aux gens ne sont jamais retrouvés. C'est pourquoi les gardes Mithra ne peuvent jamais l'arrêter... il n'y a tout simplement aucune preuve !${prompt}
  8430: |-
    Comme je le pensaisaru !
    J'ai remporté le Prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer cette année pour mon scoop sur le Voleur de Chats !${prompt}
  8431: Et tout ça grâce à vous pour avoir confirmé que c'était vrai. Je voulais vraiment vous remercier davantage, mais est-ce que cela suffira... ?${prompt}
  8432: J'ai hâte de voir notre prochain numéro exclusif.${prompt}
  8433: Mon exposé sera certainement en tête de l'actualité. Mais je ne peux pas me reposer sur mes lauriers. Un bon reporter doit continuer à suivre la vérité, car aucune histoire ne se termine jamais vraiment.${prompt}
  8434: Vous ne voyez pas que je suis occupée maintenant ? Laissez un peu de place à une fille, hein ?${prompt}
  8435: Vous avez bien mis le truc dans une boîte métallique et l'avez coulé dans la mer comme on vous l'a dit, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8436: Vous avez une chance de chat en enfer de me faire voler quelque chose comme ça à nouveau ! La prochaine fois, c'est vous qui volez et moi qui coule, d'accord ?${prompt}
  8437: |-
    Oo～h... Aa～h... Ai～e... !
    Je ne pense pas que notre dernier cambriolage était une si bonne idée. Les blessures où j'ai été mordue par le truc me font toujours mal, sans parler de mon dos après avoir porté cette lourde boîte où je l'ai mis.${prompt}
  8438: Comment ça, mon exposé scoop a été volé !?${prompt}
  8439: Ce sale Voleur de Chats pourri et fourbe ! Elle a fait une attaque préventive pour ne pas se faire prendre, c'est une catastrophe !${prompt}
  8440: Il semble que l'édition de cette semaine de "Magic Paradise Weekly" du Tarutaru Times va également être annulée.${prompt}
  8441: Si je l'ai dit une fois, je l'ai dit mille fois... Nous devrions abandonner l'utilisation de ces stupides poupées magiques pour transmettre nos histoires et revenir à la méthode éprouvée des journaux et des magazines ! Nos histoires finissent toujours par ne jamais être racontées.${prompt}
  8442: |-
    Quoi... ?
    Vous avez apporté un Cardian que vous voulez que je regarde ?${prompt}
  8443: |-
    Je vois...
    Un épisode si malheureux a causé la cessation de fonctionnement de cette pauvre chose.${prompt}
  8444: L'Orbe de Mana - le cœur de ce Cardian - brille encore. Ce n'est pas juste un cas de déplétion d'énergie magique. Le cœur de cet enfant est brisé.${prompt}
  8445: Les Cardians sont des automates créés à l'aide de la magie, mais leur capacité à percevoir les émotions est similaire à celle des humains.${prompt}
  8446: Les sentiments sont quelque chose qui se transmet entre les gens en grandissant progressivement. Les Cardians se développent aussi en captant beaucoup de ces sentiments mais... parfois ces sentiments peuvent même les briser.${prompt}
  8447: Ce Cardian que vous m'avez apporté a été fabriqué pendant les années de guerre, il a donc probablement ressenti sa juste part de chagrin au cours de sa vie.${prompt}
  8448: |-
    <Soupir>...
    Je me demande si je peux guérir cette pauvre petite chose.${prompt}
  8449: Ce n'est pas l'un des Cardians que j'ai aidés à créer. Mais... ces pauvres enfants restent tout de même ma responsabilité...${prompt}
  8450: Je vais... je vais essayer de réenchanter la magie en lui.${prompt}
  8451: Mais j'aurai besoin d'aide pour mener cela à bien. Seriez-vous assez aimable pour m'assister ?${prompt}
  8452: |-
    Aider à réparer le Cardian ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui. Tout pour aider !
    Désolé, je ne peux pas.${prompt}
  8453: |-
    Merci pour votre coopération.
    Tout d'abord, je dois retirer la vieille magie de mon père. Il était l'ancien ministre du Manustère qui a créé ce Cardian.${prompt}
  8454: Pour cela, j'aurai besoin de l'associer avec sa carte opposée de Cardian - le dix de coupes. J'ai seulement besoin d'une seule carte de dix de coupes, pourriez-vous en obtenir une pour moi, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
  8455: Certains des anciens types de Cardians - qui sont maintenant défectueux et en panne - errent dans les parties sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto. C'est là qu'il serait préférable de chercher. Mais soyez très prudent !${prompt}
  8456: C'est bien dommage...<snif>${prompt}
  8457: 'Le Dix de Coupes est la carte opposée à notre pauvre ami Cardian. Si vous m’apportez ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, je pourrai retirer la vieille magie de lui et commencer mes réparations.${prompt}'
  8458: Certains des anciens Cardians de style ancien qui ont longtemps dysfonctionné errent dans les parties sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto dans l’ouest de Sarutabaruta. Essayez de chercher là-bas. Mais soyez très prudent !${prompt}
  8459: La magie que nous utilisons pour insuffler la vie aux automates peut être très dangereuse si elle est mal utilisée.${prompt}
  8460: Elle n'a pas été aussi bien étudiée ou perfectionnée que la magie noire ou blanche. Souvent, son utilisation met le lanceur lui-même en danger.${prompt}
  8461: Les Cartes Cardian ont la capacité de dissiper la magie qui a été placée sur les Cardians... c'est un peu comme un arrêt d'urgence ou un bouton d'autodestruction.${prompt}
  8462: Le père du ministre Apururu, l'ancien ministre de notre Manustère, pouvait même retirer la magie sans utiliser de cartes... mais sans lui pour nous montrer, c'est impossible pour nous de le faire.${prompt}
  8463: Il y a beaucoup de tabous lorsqu'on insuffle la vie dans ces automates, vous savez, mon enfant ?${prompt}
  8464: Une règle très importante est de ne jamais jeter un second sortilège sur une poupée qui en a déjà un. Si vous n'êtes pas prudent, vous ou la poupée pourriez mourir ! Frissons !${prompt}
  8465: |-
    Oh, super !
    Vous l'avez trouvé !${prompt}
  8466: Maintenant, vous pouvez me laisser le reste. Vous pouvez dire aux amis de cet enfant à Jeuno qu'il faudra un peu plus de temps avant qu'il ne soit comme neuf.${prompt}
  8467: |-
    Mais...
    J'ai besoin d'effacer son Orbe de Mana pour commencer... Je dois effacer les souvenirs qui ont brisé son cœur...${prompt}
  8468: Dites aux amis de cet enfant à Jeuno qu'il ne faudra pas beaucoup plus de temps avant qu'il ne soit comme neuf.${prompt}
  8469: |-
    J'ai...
    J'ai besoin d'effacer son Orbe de Mana pour commencer. Je dois effacer les souvenirs qui ont brisé son cœur...${prompt}
  8470: |-
    Oh, c'est effrayant !
    Ne dérangez pas le ministre Apururu maintenant !${prompt}
  8471: La magie nécessaire pour insuffler la vie à un Cardian est une opération très délicate. Elle doit garder sa concentration, elle !${prompt}
  8472: Le ministre est si déterminée. Je ne veux pas qu'elle continue, mais il semble que rien ne l'arrêtera maintenant.${prompt}
  8473: Elle a tendance à s'emporter quand il s'agit de questions concernant son père. Nous devons veiller sur elle autant que possible !${prompt}
  8474: Il y a beaucoup de tabous lorsqu'on insuffle la vie dans ces automates, vous savez, mon enfant ?${prompt}
  8475: Une règle très importante est de ne jamais jeter un second sortilège sur une poupée qui en a déjà un. Si vous n'êtes pas prudent, vous ou la poupée pourriez mourir ! Frissons !${prompt}
  8476: Quoi que tu dises ? Que je te rende le livre que j'ai emprunté à la bibliothèque ?${prompt}
  8477: Pourquoi, je rends toujours les livres que j'emprunte à temps, merci ! Vous êtes sûr que vous n'avez pas la mauvaise fille ? Pourquoi pensent-ils que j'ai encore un livre ?${prompt}
  8478: |-
    Hé～hé ! Qu'est-ce...?
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} !?
    Tu crois que je suis le genre à lire un livre comme ça ? Quelle honte !${prompt}
  8479: |-
    Espèce de nigaud!
    Jamais de ma vie on m'a suggéré d'emprunter un livre embarrassant comme ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} !${prompt}
  8480: Ce n'est pas seulement une obstruction aux affaires, mais vous violez mes droits, voilà ce que c'est ! Déguerpissez avant que je vous arrache les yeux !${prompt}
  8481: |-
    Wouah là là...!
    On vous a entendu! Il semblerait que notre patronne ait un côté audacieux après tout !♪${prompt}
  8482: |-
    Wouah, super! Allez-y, patronne!
    On dirait que notre patronne est enfin décidée ! Elle n'a pas besoin de le nier autant. Être une romantique cachée, ce n'est pas quelque chose dont on devrait avoir honte...${prompt}
  8483: |-
    Hae Jakhya !?
    Maintenant que vous le mentionnez, c'est exactement comme mon nom, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8484: Youhou ! Mais comment quelqu'un pourrait-il confondre une petite princesse-chatte comme elle avec une lionne rude et dure comme moi ! C'est impensable !${prompt}
  8485: Quoi qu'il en soit, je suis soulagée que cette petite affaire soit terminée !${prompt}
  8486: Alors c'était juste une autre Mithra qui a un nom similaire à notre patronne, Hae Jakkya, qui a emprunté le roman romantique... Eh bien, quelle déception !${prompt}
  8487: Quel résultat ennuyeux.${prompt}
  8488: 'Le livre en retard s’appelait ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, n’est-ce pas ? Hmm...${prompt}'
  8489: |-
    Oh... ?
    Pas que j'aie un véritable intérêt pour une telle chose !${prompt}
  8490: Tehehe... Je vais à l’est de Sarutabaruta, je chasse beaucoup de Mandragora, je collectionne leurs bourgeons à quatre feuilles, puis je reviens ici pour les vendre et faire une petite fortune ! Je suis super riche maintenant !♪${prompt}
  8491: 'Une fois que j’aurai économisé suffisamment de gils, je me rendrai dans les magasins du port. Tout mage noir respectable devrait au moins s’équiper de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ne pensez-vous pas ?${prompt}'
  8492: |-
    Le Voleur de Chats-wat ?
    Oh, vous voulez dire Nanaa Mihgo !
    Bien sûr que je la connais !${prompt}
  8493: Elle se met en colère tout d'un coup, donc elle peut être un peu effrayante par moments, mais elle connaît beaucoup d'histoires intéressantes.${prompt}
  8494: Les Elvaan sont si arrogants. On dirait parfois qu'ils nous regardent de haut, nous les Tarutaru.${prompt} 
  8495: |-
    Hein... ?
    Comment osez-vous dire que c'est parce que nous sommes si petits que tout le monde ne peut s'empêcher de nous regarder de haut ! Dégagez avant que je vous morde les genoux !${prompt}
  8496: L'énergie magique est forte tout autour des environs de Windurst, c'est pourquoi les plantes magiques prospèrent ici !${prompt}
  8497: L'apothicaire là-bas combine ses compétences Mithra avec la flore locale pour créer toutes sortes de nouveaux produits médicinaux.${prompt}
  8498: Hmm... il doit y avoir quelques histoires intéressantes qui traînent quelque part. Hé, vous là-bas, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/mademoiselle]... avez-vous entendu des ragots croustillants récemment ?${prompt}
  8499: Je m'attendais à ce qu'il y ait de l'agitation parmi les Mithra pour savoir qui va occuper le trône de la cheffesse, mais non... Je suppose que les bonnes histoires ne viennent pas si facilement.${prompt}
  8500: Nous, les Mithra, sommes souvent appelés les "gens des bois" parce que nous vivions initialement dans des forêts.${prompt}
  8501: Eh bien, en raison de diverses circonstances, nous sommes venus vivre à Windurst. C'est un bel endroit, même si je ne pense pas que nous comprendrons jamais les coutumes des Tarutaru... mais ce ne sont pas des gens mauvais au fond.${prompt}
  8502: Il est vrai que les Mithra de Windurst obéissent à la Sybille des Étoiles...${prompt}
  8503: '...Mais c’est seulement parce que notre cheffesse, Perih Vashai, le fait elle-même.${prompt}'
  8504: Chaque fois que vous regardez autour du Bois de Windurst, vous voyez des Mithra, n'est-ce pas ? Mais il y a seulement quelques décennies, toute cette région était peuplée de Tarutaru.${prompt}
  8505: C'était jusqu'aux années de guerre lorsque la cheffesse Mithra, Perih Vashai, est venue de l'ancienne patrie Mithra avec son armée de combattants.${prompt}
  8506: Avez-vous vu ces gardes automates appelés Cardians ? Ils sont fabriqués à la Manustérie, ici même dans le Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
  8507: La Manustérie est célèbre pour être la plus modeste des cinq ministères magiques de Windurst.${prompt}
  8508: On dit que ces gardes automates appelés Cardians deviennent de plus en plus intelligents chaque jour qu'ils apprennent.${prompt}
  8509: Ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'ils ne commencent tous à développer leur propre personnalité et ne commencent à se battre entre eux. Ça ne sera pas amusant ?${prompt}
  8510: |-
    Comment ça va, mon pote ?
    Vous profitez d'une petite aventure, je vois...${prompt}
  8511: La vie est longue, et vous pouvez remettre à demain ce que vous ne voulez pas faire aujourd'hui. Alors ne vous épuisez pas trop avec toutes ces aventures, vous m'entendez ?${prompt}
  8512: C'est cette attitude qui vous empêche de trouver le trésor du vieux roi pirate, vous savez-wow !?${prompt}
  8513: Allez, on doit se bouger, Gottah ! Dépêchez-vous d'acheter cette armure que vous vouliez au port-wort pour que nous puissions sortir et monter de niveau encore plus-wore !${prompt}
  8514: La première règle de la Brigade Étoile des Oignons... !${prompt}
  8515: Soyez gentil avec tous les aventuriers à l'air stupide que vous rencontrez !${prompt}
  8516: C'est premier arrivé, premier servi quand il s'agit des objets mis aux enchères. Vous êtes en concurrence dans les enchères avec des gens du monde entier, donc n'hésitez pas si vous n'êtes pas sûr. Faites-le juste !${prompt}
  8517: |-
    J'ai faim !
    J'ai tellement faim que je pourrais manger un...
    Hé... est-ce qu'on peut manger des chocobos ?
    Je parie qu'ils ont le goût du poulet !${prompt}
  8518: Perih Vashai est une héroïne Mithra qui a rendu de grands services pendant la guerre il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
  8519: Elle a perdu beaucoup de choses à l'époque, mais jamais elle n'a perdu sa fierté ni rompu son serment. Cela montre bien que la force physique n'est pas le seul prérequis pour être un héros.${prompt}
  8520: |-
    Notre cheffesse est très âgée...
    Il semble qu'elle veuille transmettre son titre à Semih Lafihna, de la Garde Sibylline.${prompt}
  8521: Mais je doute que Semih Lafihna accepterait cette honorable responsabilité. Nous sommes vraiment dans une sacrée situation, hein ?${prompt}
  8522: Je ne pense pas que nous ayons réellement obtenu la paix en faisant un pacte avec ces homme-bêtes Yagudo!${prompt}
  8523: Mais essayez d'expliquer cela aux Tarutaru, et ils seront simplement têtus et insisteront que c'est la volonté de la Sybille des Étoiles!${prompt}
  8524: Attraper un dhalmel, c'est sacrément dur, vous savez ? Seules les Mithra ont les compétences nécessaires pour le faire correctement !${prompt}
  8525: Pour accomplir cette compétence, vous avez besoin de quelque chose de particulier. Pour vous donner un indice, c'est quelque chose que seules les Mithra ont... Purrr...${prompt}
  8526: Le centre névralgique de Windurst est le district des Murailles de Windurst, avec la Tour des Cieux entourée de cet arbre étoilé surdimensionné. Vous y arriverez si vous suivez cette route tout droit vers le nord.${prompt}
  8527: Mais c'est trop calme là-bas, avec trop de ponts à mon goût. Ça ne m'intéresse pas le moins du monde.${prompt}
  8528: Vous connaissez ce chapelier fou dans le quartier Tarutaru des Eaux de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8529: Eh bien, ces Tarutaru n'ont rien à nous envier, les Mithra du Bois de Windurst ! Nous avons notre propre folle apothicaire ici !${prompt}
  8530: Hé... Pourquoi est-ce que tous les autres Mithra parlent si mal de la Capitaine de la Garde Sibylline de la Tour des Cieux ? Elle est si forte et si classe ! Hé... Est-ce qu'elle va être notre prochain leader tribal ?${prompt}
  8531: Le Bois de Windurst est célèbre pour sa ferme de dhalmel là-haut sur la route. Vous devez absolument y jeter un œil !${prompt}
  8532: Le fromage fait avec le lait de dhalmel est un goût acquis, mais une fois que vous commencez à l'apprécier, vous ne pouvez plus vous arrêter d'en manger !${prompt}
  8533: |-
    Où est-ce que je l'ai laissé tomber?
    Zut, ça va être impossible à retrouver aussi! Quelle catastrophe... !${prompt}
  8534: J'ai entendu dire que c'était un pays avec d'étranges poupées animées utilisées comme gardes, mais cela dépasse toutes les attentes.${prompt}
  8535: On dit qu'ils fabriquent ces poupées magiques en un endroit appelé la Manustérie. Si je devais visiter là-bas, je me demande s'ils me permettraient de faire un tour avec une de ces abominations...${prompt}
  8536: |-
    Ha-ha...
    Maintenant, j'ai compris !${prompt}
  8537: Il est interdit de monter à chocobo dans la ville. C'est pourquoi ces étranges automates gardiens Cardian m'ont pourchassé autour et autour comme ça !${prompt}
  8538: |-
    Ouf...
    Je suis venu jusqu'ici à la recherche d'indices pour un nouveau type de commerce, mais je n'en crois pas mes yeux !${prompt}
  8539: Qu'est-ce que sont ces animaux au long cou qu'ils ont ici à Vana'diel ? Sont-ils aussi des créations conjurées avec la magie Tarutaru ?${prompt}
  8540: |-
    Wee... Nous valsant maintenant dans les Bois de Windurst.
    Whoa ! Vous voulez tourbillonner jusqu'aux Eaux de Windurst? Alors laissez-moi vous y transporter en un instant avec ma magie puissante, peut-être ?${prompt}

    Hein... ?
    Si vous voulez quelque chose là-bas, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/mademoiselle], alors décidez-vous vite, puis tirez-vous vite d'ici !${prompt}
  8544: Avez-vous besoin de quelque chose de urgent urgent ? J'ai toute une variété de trucs machin-choses qui pourraient vous intéresser.${prompt}
  8545: |-
    Je le sais, je le sais...
    Je peux voir d'un coup d'œil que vous êtes un aventurier.${prompt}
  8546: Je reçois toujours des livraisons de marchandises que vous trouverez sans aucun doute utiles. Rappelez-vous, je suis là pour vous aider. Bonne chance dans vos aventures.${prompt}
  8547: Je suis Tapoh Lihzeh, l'apothicaire. Avez-vous besoin de quelque chose de ma part, ou cherchez-vous ma fille ?${prompt}
  8548: Si c'est ma fille que vous cherchez, je vous suggère d'aller à Windurst Waters. Elle étudie à l'École de Magie là-bas.${prompt}
  8549: Des simples médicaments contre le rhume Mithran aux légendaires ambroisies de l'immortalité Windurstienne, nous avons tout...${prompt}
  8550: |-
    Psst ! Hé, toi...
    Oui, toi là-bas !${prompt}
  8551: Tu es du genre ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal] qui serait intéressé par mon stock secret de marchandises. Tu veux jeter un coup d'œil ?${prompt}
  8552: Psst... Intéressé par des biens vraiment hot ? Des trouvailles chanceuses de chocobo aux marchandises bon marché tombées d'un dirigeable... tout ce que j'ai est une affaire en or !${prompt}
  8553: Tu es intéressé par un peu de shopping bon marché, n'est-ce pas ? Désolé, je ne fais pas affaire en ce moment.${prompt}
  8554: Mesdames et messieurs, chatons et chatons ! Avons-nous la vente que vous attendiez !${prompt}
  8555: Désolé, mais notre magasin est fermé en ce moment. Pourquoi ne pas aller à Gustaberg et aider là-bas ?${prompt}
  8556: Pourquoi ne pas acheter quelque chose chez moi ? Vous ne le regretterez pas ! J'ai toutes sortes de marchandises de la région de Zulkheim !${prompt}
  8557: |-
    Je prends une pause de

    la zone résidentielle.${prompt}
  8558: Ooh... avez-vous de superbes marchandises pour vous ! Man... ce sont des offres à ne pas manquer, alors profitez-en tant que vous le pouvez.${prompt}
  8559: "<pant> Je suis juste un pauvre \ncommerçant. Mon pote, mais attends !\nDes luttes... un jour je vivrai la grande vie.\nEh bien, c'est mon rêve, en tout cas...${prompt}"
  8560: Oui. C'est le consulat de San d'Oria. Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  8561: Je vois... Vous n'avez pas affaire à moi. Désolé, mais j'ai du travail auquel je dois retourner, alors veuillez me permettre de continuer. Bonne journée.${prompt}
  8562: Si je peux me permettre, permettez-moi de vous parler un peu de San d'Oria...${prompt}
  8563: San d'Oria est une terre de l'épée et de grande foi. Elle est célèbre pour ses courageux chevaliers royaux et ses loyaux chevaliers du temple, son grand château royal et sa glorieuse cathédrale.${prompt}
  8564: Les hymnes chantés dans la cathédrale sont particulièrement divins. Même les cœurs les plus endurcis ne peuvent s'empêcher d'être émus par eux.${prompt}
  8565: Il est plutôt impossible de dire que le gouvernement de Windurst est le système le plus logique. Cependant, les Tarutarus croient en leur Sybille des étoiles et entretiennent des liens solides les uns avec les autres.${prompt}
  8566: Et n'est-ce pas la foi et les liens de ses citoyens qui rendent un pays fort ? Ce n'est que lorsque les cœurs des individus sont unifiés qu'un gouvernement peut vraiment fonctionner.${prompt}
  8567: |-
    C'est le consulat de San d'Oria.
    Notre rôle est de servir et de protéger les citoyens de San d'Oria résidant à Windurst.${prompt}
  8568: Mais bien sûr, nous n'abandonnerons pas les citoyens non San d'Oriens qui ont besoin de notre aide. Car nous, les San d'Oriens, sommes en effet un peuple juste.${prompt}
  8569: 'La lumière brille là où il y a la droiture, alors ne craignez pas, citoyen de ${choice: 1}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. Les soldats de San d’Oria ne dégaineront leur épée que au nom de la justice.${prompt}'
  8570: La lumière ne brille que là où il y a la droiture. Compatriote de San d'Oria, ne perdez jamais la fierté que vous avez envers votre pays.${prompt}
  8571: |-
    Bienvenue au consulat de San d'Oria.
    Si vous souhaitez parler au consul Mourices, entrez dans son bureau par la porte à votre droite.${prompt}
  8572: Ah, vous êtes venu tout droit de San d'Oria, n'est-ce pas ? Votre dévouement envers la patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}
  8573: Malheureusement, je suis d'humeur massacrante aujourd'hui. Après avoir lu la demande de mission de Windurst, j'ai été profondément dégoûté.${prompt}
  8574: Forine, veuillez expliquer à ${choice-player-gender}[ce brave homme/cette charmante dame] ici présente en quoi consiste la mission.${prompt}
  8575: |-
    Oui, Consul.
    Permettez-moi d'expliquer...${prompt}
  8576: La mission du gouvernement de Windurst consiste à offrir une armure magique à Giddeus, le premier rempart de l'antre des Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  8577: Un bouclier magique vous sera remis à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst. Votre mission est de le livrer dans la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément enfouie sous terre à Giddeus.${prompt}
  8578: Avez-vous eu la malchance de rencontrer les Yagudo ? Ils ont pris l'habitude détestable d'attaquer les voyageurs qui traversent Sarutabaruta en bande...${prompt}
  8579: Ce sont les mêmes beastmen qui se sont rangés du côté de "l'Alliance" il y a vingt ans, et ont tué bon nombre de nos camarades lors de la guerre.${prompt}
  8580: Cependant, les Windurstiens sont devenus trop complaisants et montrent leur amour de la pacifisme - même si ce n'est rien de plus qu'une façade unilatérale - en nouant des relations amicales avec les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
  8581: Et maintenant, ils osent demander à nous, fiers San d'Oriens, de porter un tribut à une bande de beastmen. C'en serait presque risible si ce n'était pas un tel affront.${prompt}
  8582: Cependant, cette mission doit être accomplie dans le cadre de notre engagement envers Windurst. Nous, les Elvaan, ne sommes pas du genre à rompre nos promesses, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8583: Et pourtant, en tant que San d'Oriens, nous ne pouvons permettre que cette injustice reste impunie.${prompt}
  8584: La situation est des plus exaspérantes. Cependant, je dois vous ordonner de partir et de donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. Mais en même temps, je vous supplie de priver les autres Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin de deux de leurs boucliers, afin de compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
  8585: Allez, en avant !${prompt}
  8586: Aussi exaspérante que soit la situation, je dois vous ordonner d'aller donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. En même temps, je vous en supplie, privés les Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin du double du nombre de boucliers pour compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
  8587: Aucun Elvaan ne ferait quelque chose d'aussi déshonorant que de rompre une promesse envers un autre.${prompt}
  8588: Votre mission est de vous rendre à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst, où un bouclier magique vous sera remis.${prompt}
  8589: Afin d'accomplir cette mission telle que l'a assignée Windurst, vous devez livrer le bouclier à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément sous terre à Giddeus. Mais ce n'est pas tout...${prompt}
  8590: Bien que nous ne puissions rompre notre promesse envers les Windurstiens, pour assurer que la justice soit rendue, nous aimerions secrètement que vous preniez deux boucliers aux Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin.${prompt}
  8591: Agissez selon nos convictions tout en remplissant notre promesse envers les Tarutaru. C'est en effet une voie appropriée pour nous, le peuple de la glorieuse San d'Oria.${prompt}
  8592: |-
    Imbécile !
    N'avez-vous pas entendu correctement nos ordres ? Ou cherchez-vous simplement à déclencher une guerre ?${prompt}
  8593: Ne pouvez-vous pas vous retourer la partie la plus importante de la mission ? Vous deviez livrer un bouclier magique à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo. Et vous vous appelez San d'Orien !?${prompt}
  8594: Imbécile !${prompt}
  8595: Vous avez seulement remis le bouclier magique de Windurst aux Yagudo et êtes parti en courant, laissant l'équilibre du pouvoir biaisé. Une telle action serait considérée comme une trahison à San d'Oria !!!${prompt}
  8596: Humph. Il semble que vous ayez su maintenir le chemin de la droiture.${prompt}
  8597: Vous devez maintenant vous rendre au consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
  8598: Savez-vous comment vous rendre à Bastok à partir d'ici ? Vous pouvez voyager par mer depuis Mhaura jusqu'à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
  8599: |-
    Gloire au Royaume de San d'Oria.
    Adieu et bon voyage.${prompt}
  8600: Dirigez-vous vers le Consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
  8601: Le meilleur moyen de se rendre à Bastok d'ici est de prendre un navire de Mhaura à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
  8602: La République de Bastok est occupée par deux races, les Humes et les Galkas, qui sont exactement l'antithèse l'une de l'autre.${prompt}
  8603: Parfois, ils se battent, il est donc impératif que vous mainteniez la neutralité pendant que vous évaluez la situation, puis vous joignez aux justes.${prompt}
  8604: Maintenant que vous avez accompli cette petite mission d'amitié, vous êtes de nouveau un simple citoyen de San d'Oria. Vous êtes donc libre d'aller à Giddeus et de vraiment donner à ces bêtes ce qu'elles méritent.${prompt}
  8605: Cependant, nous ne prendrons pas la responsabilité si vous êtes sérieusement blessé dans le processus.${prompt}
  8606: Vos efforts sont bien notés. Prenez soin de votre voyage à Bastok.${prompt}
  8607: Donc, vous êtes venu tout le chemin depuis San d'Oria, hein ? Votre dévouement au service de la mère patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}
  8608: Cette mission au nom du gouvernement de Windurst témoigne du niveau d'amitié de notre pays envers Windurst.${prompt}
  8609: Forine, veuillez expliquer à ce ${choice-player-gender}[brave homme/gentille dame] ici ce que la mission implique.${prompt}
  8610: |-
    Oui, Consul.
    Permettez-moi d'expliquer la demande de Windurst...${prompt}
  8611: Un monstre géant est apparu dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, le territoire frontalier du théocratie des Yagudos. Le gouvernement de Windurst veut l'exterminer.${prompt}
  8612: Vous devez recevoir une clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst et vous diriger vers la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, où la créature vous attend.${prompt}
  8613: Ha-ha ! Quelle histoire joyeuse. Un monstre féroce apparaissant au cœur de Giddeus, effrayant tellement les Yagudos qu'ils demandent aux Tarutarus de les aider ?${prompt}
  8614: C'est très chanceux pour ces bêtes que le gouvernement de Windurst ait cherché des relations amicales avec eux afin de maintenir la paix de leur pays.${prompt}
  8615: Quoi ? Ne me dites pas que vous n'avez pas entendu parler du petit pacte de paix de Windurst avec les Yagudos ?${prompt}
  8616: Bien sûr, nous, San d'Oriens, n'avons aucun besoin de montrer à ces vulgaires bêtes aucune courtoisie, mais c'est un accord entre nos deux pays, donc nous n'avons d'autre choix que de le respecter.${prompt}
  8617: Allez donc exterminer le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne pensez pas que vous devez vous retenir de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
  8618: |-
    Quoi qu'il en soit, assez de bavardages.
    Bonne chance dans votre mission.${prompt}
  8619: Allez et exterminiez le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne vous retenez pas de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
  8620: Pour accéder à la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, vous devez recevoir la clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst.${prompt}
  8621: Revenez ici une fois que vous avez vaincu le monstre féroce qui menace les Yagudos dans les profondeurs de Giddeus.${prompt}
  8622: Je ne chercherais pas à priver les Tarutarus de cette terre de poursuivre la paix. C'est juste que je désire une paix durable, pas la façade temporaire qu'a maintenant Windurst.${prompt}
  8623: La tranquillité apparente de cet endroit peut être considérée comme une illusion née de l'idéalisme. Jusqu'à ce que nous réveillions Windurst de son rêve, elle continuera à être hors d'aide.${prompt}
  8624: Devenir soldat est un mode de vie complètement différent de celui d'un simple combattant.${prompt}
  8625: Vous êtes pris entre des ordres complexes et la chevalerie, et parfois vous devez aller à l'encontre de vos convictions personnelles...${prompt}
  8626: De quoi parlez-vous ? Le Seigneur des Ombres est en train d'être ressuscité !?${prompt}
  8627: |-
    Cela ne peut pas être !
    Nous devrons en informer la famille royale !${prompt}
  8628: Je vais rédiger une lettre. J'aurai besoin que vous la remettiez sans tarder à Monarlais Halver dans la mère patrie.${prompt}
  8629: Vous devez protéger cette lettre avec votre vie. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous de la remettre à San d'Oria !${prompt}
  8630: Que faites-vous à traîner, ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille] ? Ne vous ai-je pas ordonné de vous dépêcher de retourner à San d'Oria et de remettre ma lettre à Halver, le Monarlais ?${prompt}
  8631: Le visage du Consul Mourices a blanchi. Avez-vous dit quelque chose pour le contrarier ? N'avez-vous pas accompli correctement votre mission ?${prompt}
  8632: Le monstre féroce était vraiment un piège tendu par les bêtes... ? Quel horrible retournement de situation cela s'est avéré être.${prompt}
  8633: |-
    De plus, il est question de l'apparition d'une bête des ténèbres ?
    Est-ce possible... ? Non ! Ne me dites pas que nous nous lançons droit vers une autre Grande Guerre ?${prompt}
  8634: Vous avez mentionné que lorsque la bête des ténèbres est apparue, une garde Mithra est venue à votre secours ?${prompt}
  8635: La seule Mithra avec ce degré de force serait l'une des Gardes Sibylles de la Tour des Cieux.${prompt}

  8670: En fait, la plupart d'entre eux deviennent ministres des ministères ! Dire qu'ils ont un grand potentiel est un euphémisme !${prompt}
  8671: Pourquoi les enfants Tarutaru voudraient-ils jamais étudier dans une École de Magie ?${prompt}
  8672: Grrr... Je détesterais être contraint de rester assis devant un bureau toute la journée. Cela me semble être une punition.${prompt}
  8673: En y réfléchissant... il y a une Mithra dans la classe avancée de l'École de Magie, tu sais ?${prompt}

    Rrralentis, Soni-Muni !
    J'ai entendu que ce labyrinthe n'est pas une simple promenade. Nous n'avons aucune chance à notre niveau actuel, alors il vaudrait mieux s'entraîner d'abord !${prompt}

  8710: Mais alors, on n'aurait pas entendu les nouvelles sur le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami, hein ? Vrrrai ?${prompt}
  8711: Notre cheftaine a récemment invité Semih Lafihna pour ouvrir le dialogue, mais Semih Lafihna n'a pas accepté l'offre.${prompt}
  8712: Ce n'est pas vraiment une surprise. Pour Semih Lafihna, son héritage Mithra n'a aucune importance dans sa position dans la société Tarutaru. Elle aurait aussi bien pu naître Tarutaru.${prompt}

    Que voulez-vous savoir ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Qu'est-ce que la maison de ventes aux enchères ?
    Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
    Y a-t-il des frais ?
    Y a-t-il des limites ?
    Comment vérifier les marchandises ?
    Comment retirer un article ?
    Ma liste “Statut des ventes” est pleine !
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  8733: Les maisons de ventes aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Ici, les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les anciennes armures... presque tout.${prompt}
  8734: Actuellement, les maisons de ventes aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix varient d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  8735: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de ventes aux enchères, quel que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  8736: Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou au-dessus de celui-ci achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  8737: Une fois mis aux enchères, les marchandises y resteront pendant un maximum de trente semaines de Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
  8738: Si les marchandises ne sont pas vendues dans ce délai, elles seront retournées à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  8739: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles individuels et les articles empilables.${prompt}
  8740: Un frais de transaction est prélevé lorsque des marchandises sont mises aux enchères. Ce frais est non remboursable.${prompt}
  8741: Le Comité International des Ventes aux Enchères, ou CIVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles peut être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
  8742: Cependant, le CIVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles que l'on peut acheter.${prompt}
  8743: Un certain temps est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
  8744: Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste “Statut des ventes”, il peut ne pas immédiatement apparaître sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
  8745: Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une enchère, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de ventes aux enchères, et sélectionner “Arrêter la vente” dans le menu “Statut des ventes”.${prompt}
  8746: Pour retirer un article de votre liste “Statut des ventes”, vous devez vous rendre à un comptoir d'enchères pour reconnaître la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
  8747: Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
  8748: À n'importe quel comptoir d'enchères, ouvrez le menu “Statut des ventes” et reconnaissez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
  8749: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
  8750: Y a-t-il autre chose que vous voudriez savoir ?${prompt}
  8751: Par le passé, beaucoup ont amassé de grandes richesses grâce à la maison de ventes aux enchères. J'espère que vous trouverez fortune, vous aussi !${prompt}

  8800: Here's your present--the behemoth of Mog Safes, kupo! Now you can store as many as 70 items, kupo!${prompt}
  8801: The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!${prompt}
  8802: |-
    Master, Master!
    I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt}
  8803: 'After resting on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?${prompt}'
  8804: |-
    Give your moogle some time off?
    ${selection-lines}
    Have fun, kupo!
    No, I am your only friend now!${prompt}
  8805: |-
    Oh, thank you, master!
    My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!${prompt}
  8806: 'The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} for my friends there, kupo!${prompt}'
  8807: 'And my other buddies need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!${prompt}'
  8808: 'I can''t help out my friends if I don''t have ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo...${prompt}'
  8809: I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!${prompt}
  8810: |-
    Master!
    I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!${prompt}
  8811: We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt}
  8812: |-
    I was looking for you.
    It seems like you've been prrracticing to become a master thief.${prompt}
  8813: Usually I don't mingle with my competition, but the Tenshodo has put out a call for able-bodied thieves.${prompt}
  8814: The Tenshodo came to us, so don't even think of turning down their offer.${prompt}
  8815: |-
    Well, I'll see you in Jeuno!
    As those little wizards say, ta-taru!${prompt}
  8816: I'll see you at the Tenshodo headquarters in Jeuno.${prompt}
  8817: The Tenshodo is one of the biggest dealers of merchandise in all of Vana'diel. An adventurer like you has surely heard of it.${prompt}
  8818: Ahh, Jeuno... How long has it been since I last got my paws into the pockets of those bigwigs?${prompt}
  8819: You say you've already met up with the rrremains of Atarefaunet's band? Did they tell you anything?${prompt}
  8820: The guy I talked to was acting like he was so much better than us. He sure rrrubbed my fur the wrrrong way.${prompt}
  8821: You don't hearrr the name Atarefaunet around these parts that often. I heard that he was pretty famous in the west, though.${prompt}
  8822: At the time, Atarefaunet's band was loaded with the best of the best. They say that some of the memberrrs were even professional killers, so you had better watch your back.${prompt}
  8823: <Sigh> The top cat can surrre be difficult at times...${prompt}
  8824: The weapon you got... What's it like?${prompt}
  8825: Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!${prompt}
  8826: |-
    Ah, I've been looking for you.
    You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?${prompt}
  8827: Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?${prompt}
  8828: 'You know, the last signature on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? It was a single letter. Did you see it?${prompt}'
  8829: |-
    Did you see the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8830: |-
    Are you rrreally a thief?
    Un-be-liev-able!!${prompt}
  8831: |-
    Let me tell you, then.
    The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
  8832: "How do I know, you ask? \nI can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt}"
  8833: |-
    Ah! That's my little thief!
    ...So, what was the letter?${prompt}
  8834: |-
    What was the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    T
    A
    V
    I...forget.${prompt}
  8835: |-
    Rrright.
    The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
  8836: But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt}
  8837: The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt}
  8838: This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt}
  8839: Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt}
  8840: After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.${prompt}
  8841: The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.${prompt}
  8842: Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt}
  8843: I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt}
  8844: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Where do I sign?
    I'll keep my paws out of this one...${prompt}
  8845: Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...${prompt}
  8846: Are you up for it?${prompt}
  8847: |-
    Okay, take these.
    I made copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.${prompt}
  8848: |-
    Huh? What should you say?
    I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt}
  8849: The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt}
  8850: We tailed them to their hideouts. Herrre, I wrote the locations down for you.${prompt}
  8851: If the top cat says something is fishy, you better believe it!${prompt}
  8852: First things first! Get ahold of those signatures. Oh, and by the way, don't even think of drrropping this little errand halfway through...${prompt}
  8853: 'The location of the hideouts are wrrritten on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, right?${prompt}'
  8854: Find the hideouts, and get those signatures. Go on, shoo!${prompt}
  8855: From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.${prompt}
  8856: Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?${prompt}
  8857: |-
    Just a minute!
    I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8858: But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!${prompt}
  8859: Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.${prompt}
  8860: |-
    Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together...
    V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...${prompt}　
  8861: Hmm... If I put this here... Umm...${prompt}
  8862: |-
    Huh? You still here?
    Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}
  8863: |-
    Huh? You still here?
    Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}
  8864: |-
    We had our troubles, too.
    The member I went after told me, “Thieves need to be fleet on their feet.” I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.${prompt}
  8865: |-
    Ow, I hurt...
    What use is beauty in thieving?
    My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt}
  8866: I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt}
  8867: When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt}
  8868: |-
    Tavnazia...
    In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt}
  8869: Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt}
  8870: Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt}
  8871: If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt}
  8872: |-
    Isn't this exciting?
    The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt}
  8873: Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt}
  8874: Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt}
  8875: Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt}
  8876: If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt}
  8877: Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt}
  8878: Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt}
  8879: |-
    ...Hmm.
    A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt}
  8880: Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt}
  8881: Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt}
  8882: '...That''s it!${prompt}'
  8883: |-
    ${name-player},
    I want you to go and ask these two thieves a question.${prompt}
  8884: The person who wrote the papers from the Tenshodo, the name at the top...what was wrrritten there?${prompt}
  8885: Quickly now! There's no time!${prompt}
  8886: We'll deal with the rest, so hurry! Be on your way!${prompt}
  8887: A nation with allegiance to San d'Oria, ruled by Marquis Altedour... It's supposed to lie farrr to the west of here...${prompt}
  8888: Anyway, let's put the geography lesson aside and go pull the rrrug out from under the Tenshodo! Things have started to get interesting...${prompt}
  8889: Vauderame is a very mysterrrious character. He's been in the Tenshodo for ten years, quietly building up his current standing.${prompt}
  8890: I get the sense that he's made a deliberrrate effort to rrreach a position that allows him to move freely while keeping a low profile.${prompt}
  8891: |-
    Did you get the information I asked for?
    Okay, let's put it all together and see what we have.${prompt}
  8892: You've probably already noticed, but the name of the person who wrrrote the papers is different on each one. However, the contents are all exactly the same. A little odd, don't you think?${prompt}
  8893: This must have some other meaning. If we lay out the letters that we both discovered, we have... D, L, E, L, O, R, E.${prompt}
  8894: '...What was the letter you had for the papers you delivered originally?${prompt}'
  8895: |-
    What was the signature?
    ${selection-lines}
    M
    Q
    Blank
    I forget${prompt}
  8896: Exactly. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...${prompt}
  8897: If you keep playing the fool, I may have to bite you. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...${prompt}
  8898: “Ordelle”!${prompt}
  8899: We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!${prompt}
  8900: Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt}
  8901: We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!${prompt}
  8902: Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt}
  8903: |-
    What's all the fuss about?
    You've brrroken the code!? Terrrific!${prompt}
  8904: Atarefaunet's band is rumored to contain prrrofessional killers, so keep on your toes and keep out of sight. They're a dangerrrous bunch.${prompt}
  8905: It's great that we found the treasure... But I get the feeling there's something important I'm forgetting... What could it be...? Grrr, that's rrreally gonna annoy me...${prompt}
  8906: Thanks for looking after the top cat. If something happened to her, we'd just go back to being a couple of strrrays.${prompt}
  8907: When I checked at the Tenshodo, Vauderame was nowhere to be found. It's like he just popped out of existence...${prompt}
  8908: So you have come, my fellow ranger. I thank the winds for your safe return.${prompt}
  8909: "I have a task for you. \nIt is said that adventurers follow the winds, traveling far and wide across Vana'diel.${prompt}"
  8910: I wish for you to meet with Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna with all haste. Give her this. She should rrreturn here with you.${prompt}
  8911: Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent.${prompt}
  8912: |-
    There is little time.
    ...The blessing of the winds go with you.${prompt}
  8913: Find Semih Lafihna and give her the earring. She should rrreturn here with you.${prompt}
  8914: Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent. May the winds protect and guide you, adventurer.${prompt}
  8915: A Mithran Tracker from the homeland has arrived.${prompt}
  8916: |-
    It's been decades since...
    The sin will not be forgiven. Even if what happened was destiny...${prompt}
  8917: For Mithra, there are three laws that are inviolate.${prompt}
  8918: The Mithran Tracker is the one who brings judgment for those sins. The family who perpetrated the sin is extinguished from the land, from the sky, from time itself.${prompt}
  8919: I see you were able to find Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
  8920: |-
    ...Just a moment...
    That prrresence...${prompt}
  8921: Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I apologize for this interruption.${prompt}
  8922: '...You are the Mithran Tracker, I prrresume?${prompt}'
  8923: If your visit concerns the sinner's daughter, we are prrresently focusing all our efforts on finding the one who can confirm her passing.${prompt}
  8924: Attempt to rrreturn the past to dust if you will, but it will avail you naught. Dust is swept up by the wind, its scent carried on. The scent of my quarry.${prompt}
  8925: |-
    I will tell you once morrre.
    I have no rrreason to hide the past. The bearer of the bow does not oppose the trrruth.${prompt}
  8926: Be that as it may, the loss of the Bow of Light does not sit well with me.${prompt}
  8927: |-
    I will speak bluntly.
    Perih Vashai, I believe you strrruck some kind of deal with the sinner.${prompt}
  8928: Your daughter's age was close to that of the sinner's. Is it possible you sympathized with their plight?${prompt}
  8929: '......${prompt}'
  8930: As I'm sure you are well aware, I won't be leaving this land until I have hunted down the sinner. I will enlighten the people of the Outlands on the evils of hiding sin.${prompt}
  8931: Chieftainness Perih Vashai!${prompt}
  8932: |-
    The Mithra I just saw...
    She was the Mithran Tracker from the homeland, wasn't she?${prompt}
  8933: |-
    Yes, but do not seek to hinder her.
    She is here to see justice done, and serves nature as we do.${prompt}
  8934: |-
    I want you to give me a clear answer.
    I come as a keeper of the peace of Windurst. Is the daughter of the sinner really dead?${prompt}
  8935: |-
    Do you doubt it...?
    I see, you were questioned by the Tracker.${prompt}
  8936: Yes, she followed me to Jugner Forest. It seems the sinner carries a scent that we cannot detect.${prompt}
  8937: 'But I was not the daughter the Tracker was seeking. Did you send the earring out of concern for me? If so, your fears appear to be unfounded.${prompt} '
  8938: '......${prompt}'
  8939: I will take this opportunity to tell you, even if you are found to be guilty, I have no intention of becoming the next Chieftainness of Windurst.${prompt}
  8940: However, I also have little desirrre to aid that Mithran Tracker in her hunt. I have no interest in the mysterrries of the past. The future is all that concerns me now.${prompt}
  8941: |-
    ${name-player}.
    You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.${prompt}
  8942: I feel that your talents will become necessary before this struggle comes to an end. Will you promise to lend us your strrrength in our time of need?${prompt}
  8943: Take this as a symbol of your pledge. May the path cleared by the wind always lie before you.${prompt}
  8944: |-
    ${name-player}.
    You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.${prompt}
  8945: Je sens que vos talents seront nécessaires avant que cette lutte ne touche à sa fin. Accepteriez-vous de nous prêter votre force en temps de besoin ?${prompt}
  8946: Le Pisteuse Mithra est arrivé depuis la patrie de notre peuple.${prompt}
  8947: Il y avait une autre fois, il y a vingt ans, où un Pisteuse Mithra est arrivé d'outre-mer. Cependant, ce n'était pas la même Mithra qui était ici il y a un moment.${prompt}
  8948: Pour les Mithra, il y a trois lois inviolables.${prompt}
  8949: Peu importe à quelle distance nous errons de la patrie, nous ne pouvons pas échapper à ces lois. Pour ceux qui enfreignent les lois de la nature, seul l'oubli les attend.${prompt}
  8950: 'Bonne chance, ${choice: 0}[citoyen/camarade]. Je vous accorde le Sceau de votre nation.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'

    Les effets de la prise de contrôle des régions.
    Régions contrôlées par d'autres nations.
    Régions sous le contrôle des bêtes.${prompt}
  8966: Toutes les trois nations s'efforcent quotidiennement de mettre davantage de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les "conquêtes". Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en vainquant des ennemis tant que vous avez le Sceau appliqué sur vous.${prompt}
  8967: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui débarrasse ces zones du plus grand nombre de monstres gagne le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  8968: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  8969: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}
  8970: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des avant-postes situés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.
    Ils sont là pour vous appliquer le Sceau, vous les aventuriers.${prompt}
  8971: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux des ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
  8972: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez également des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  8973: |-
    Vous voyez donc... les conquêtes bénéficient aux nations et aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
  8974: |-
    Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant "Info Région" dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}

  8983: Lorsque les résultats des conquêtes sont annoncés, vous saurez quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les bêtes peuvent prendre le contrôle des régions.${prompt}
  8984: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières y seront placés pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8985: Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
  8986: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et porte notre nation au sommet des classements.${prompt}
  8987: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions face à d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les prochains résultats des conquêtes soient annoncés.${prompt}
  8988: En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}

  9292: Have the winds sent you to me once more...?${prompt}
  9293: I have just had word that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
  9294: Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
  9295: |-
    You have your task.
    The blessing of the winds upon you.${prompt}
  9296: I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
  9297: Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
  9298: Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.${prompt}
  9299: There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...${prompt}
  9300: There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.${prompt}
  9301: We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.${prompt}
  9302: |-
    You have rrreturned.
    ...And the Mithran Tracker with you.${prompt}
  9303: After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  9304: 'There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner''s daughter.${prompt}'
  9305: |-
    However, one problem rrremains.
    Where is the other half of the stone?
    Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt}
  9306: We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt}
  9307: Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt}
  9308: It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt}
  9309: If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt}
  9310: 'Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9311: |-
    I must apologize, adventurer.
    I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Tour des Cieux to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  9312: The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt}
  9313: In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt}
  9314: The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt}
  9315: 'I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt}'
  9316: |-
    You found it...
    Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9317: |-
    I'm impressed.
    Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt}
  9318: However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt}
  9319: This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt}
  9320: The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt}
  9321: It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt}
  9322: Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt}
  9323: '......${prompt}'
  9324: |-
    Very well.
    It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt}
  9325: I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt}
  9326: And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt}
  9327: |-
    ...The Bow of Light.
    Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt}
  9328: This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt}
  9329: We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt}
  9330: Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt}
  9331: The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt}
  9332: But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt}
  9333: |-
    ...?
    The one who follows you here...${prompt}
  9334: |-
    Perih Vashai.
    There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt}
  9335: '...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt}'
  9336: No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt}
  9337: I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt}
  9338: I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt}
  9339: I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Tour des Cieux to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt}
  9340: Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt}
  9341: Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9342: |-
    Then why?
    The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt}
  9343: 'At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt}'
  9344: Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt}
  9345: I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt}
  9346: Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt}
  9347: 'If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt}'
  9348: Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt}
  9349: I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt}
  9350: The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt}
  9351: Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt}
  9352: The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt}
  9353: But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt}
  9354: So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt}
  9355: The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt}
  9356: I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt}
  9357: I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt}
  9358: It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9359: I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt}
  9360: Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt}
  9361: |-
    It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.
    Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt}
  9362: And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt}
  9363: '...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt}'
  9364: '...Hmmm, the Tracker''s real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt}'
  9365: And not catching the sinner?${prompt}
  9366: I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9367: In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt}
  9368: |-
    ......
    Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt}
  9369: But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt}
  9370: The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt}
  9371: That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt}
  9372: Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt}
  9373: |-
    ...I understand now.
    Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt}
  9374: Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt}
  9375: You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt}
  9376: |-
    ......
    I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt}
  9377: But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt}
  9378: '......${prompt}'
  9379: |-
    ...Perih Vashai.
    I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt}
  9380: |-
    I will come to see you again.
    Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.
  9381: Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt}
  9382: What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt}
  9383: All of the children taken in by Tour des Cieux lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt}
  9384: You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt}
  9385: We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt}
  9386: She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt}
  9387: |-
    Ho there, adventurer.
    Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  9388: There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt}
  9389: Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt}
  9390: |-
    Ah, you've arrived.
    With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt}
  9391: Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
  9392: Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt}
  9393: |-
    Heh-heh-heh.
    That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt}
  9394: We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt}
  9395: Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt}
  9396: 'But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I''ll buy them from you.${prompt}'
  9397: They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt}
  9398: 'If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt}'
  9399: We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt}
  9400: I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt}
  9401: |-
    You found some?
    Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt}
  9402: |-
    Hello, adventurer.
    If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt}
  9403: Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  9404: Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt}
  9405: |-
    Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.
    ...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt}
  9406: Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt}
  9407: I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt}
  9408: W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt}
  9409: |-
    I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...
    M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt}
  9410: |-
    Ajido-Marujido...
    Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt}
  9411: It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt}
  9412: '...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt}'
  9413: The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt}
  9414: |-
    Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?
    Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
  9415: |-
    She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?
    Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt}
  9416: |-
    Things are so easygoing herrre lately.
    It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt}
  9417: Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt}
  9418: S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt}
  9419: |-
    I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?
    It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt}
  9420: |-
    ......
    I mustaru help my brother...!
    I havetaru be strong...!${prompt}
  9421: You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9422: Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
  9423: You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9424: '...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt}'
  9425: The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt}
  9426: There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt}
  9427: |-
    What an uproarrr!
    There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt}
  9428: '...But being a Tarutaru problem, it''s probably nothing to get worked up about. He''ll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt}'
  9429: I always thought Tour des Cieux just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt}
  9430: What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt}
  9431: Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt}
  9432: Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt}
  9433: The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt}
  9434: Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt}
  9435: |-
    ...Oh, it's a little late, but...
    Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt}
  9436: I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
  9437: |-
    I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.
    W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt}
  9438: I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt}
  9439: If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt}
  9440: You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt}
  9441: Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt}
  9442: This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9443: The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9444: I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt}
  9445: This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
  9446: The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt}
  9447: I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt}
  9448: S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt}
  9449: We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt}
  9450: '...I don''t really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt}'
  9451: |-
    Have you ever been to the southern continent?
    There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt}
  9452: |-
    We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.
    We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt}
  9453: Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt}
  9454: |-
    Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.
    There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt}
  9455: |-
    Rrright, down to brass tacks.
    Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt}
  9456: The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt}
  9457: Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt}
  9458: D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt}
  9459: O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt}
  9460: |-
    Let me see...
    ...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt}
  9461: |-
    What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?
    Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt}
  9462: F...f...froggies!${prompt}
  9463: Meow!${prompt}
  9464: The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt}
  9465: What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt}
  9466: This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt}
  9467: Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt}
  9468: I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt}
  9469: Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt}
  9470: Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt}
  9471: Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  9472: W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt}
  9473: Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt}
  9474: I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt}
  9475: Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt}
  9476: But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt}
  9477: |-
    You have my thanks.
    I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt}
  9478: As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt}
  9479: "My brother is a very resilient person. \nHowever, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt}"
  9480: |-
    I beg of you!
    Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt}
  9481: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me!
    It's too risky.${prompt}
  9482: |-
    ......
    That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt}
  9483: |-
    ...Thank you.
    ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9484: I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt}
  9485: The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt}
  9486: The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
  9487: 'After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt}'
  9488: |-
    Give it up, Apururu.
    That seal is beyond you.${prompt}
  9489: Professor Shantotto...${prompt}
  9490: |-
    I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.
    Why don't you just stand at the top of Tour des Cieux and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt}
  9491: |-
    How imprudent.
    And you were always such a bright student.${prompt}
  9492: I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt}
  9493: |-
    I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.
    Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt}
  9494: Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt}
  9495: This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt}
  9496: However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt}
  9497: And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Tour des Cieux, like before.${prompt}
  9498: '...!${prompt}'
  9499: |-
    Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?
    You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt}
  9500: |-
    If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.
    Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt}
  9501: Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt}
  9502: '......${prompt}'
  9503: |-
    ...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.
    I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt}
  9504: |-
    Really, Professor Shantotto?
    Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt}
  9505: |-
    Ohoho!
    You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.
    But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt}
  9506: |-
    Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.
    We can only get started when you have them all.
    Ohoho!${prompt}
  9507: Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt}
  9508: |-
    You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.
    Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt}
  9509: |-
    Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.
    Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt}
  9510: |-
    It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.
    There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt}
  9511: |-
    This is why I need your help.
    Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9512: I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt}
  9513: With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9514: Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt}
  9515: We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt}
  9516: We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt}
  9517: Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt}
  9518: |-
    Isn't that a good thing?
    Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt}
  9519: |-
    “Rules were made to be broken.”
    That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt}
  9520: |-
    And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:
    “Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt}
  9521: |-
    Of course! I had totarully forgotten.
    When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Tour des Cieux...${prompt}
  9522: There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt}
  9523: |-
    What's that!?
    The Cardians have chosen a king!?
    What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt}
  9524: I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt}
  9525: But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt}
  9526: |-
    ......
    No. It's not possible!${prompt}
  9527: |-
    ......
    But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  9528: I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
  9529: '...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}'
  9530: I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
  9531: You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt}
  9532: |-
    Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
    ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
  9533: We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9534: |-
    Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
    ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
  9535: We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9536: |-
    ${name-player}.
    ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
  9537: |-
    Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
    If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
  9538: |-
    ......
    But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt}
  9539: I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt}
  9540: 'Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt}'
  9541: Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt}
  9542: |-
    ${name-player}.
    ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
  9543: |-
    Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
    If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
  9544: |-
    Things don'taru look good.
    If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt}
  9545: |-
    Wait a minute.
    Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt}
  9546: |-
    You're worried, rightaru?
    I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt}
  9547: I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt}
  9548: |-
    I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!
    Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt}
  9549: But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt}
  9550: There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt}
  9551: |-
    Ahaha, serves him rrright!
    That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt}
  9552: He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt}
  9553: |-
    You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?
    I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt}
  9554: |-
    This is...
    This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt}
  9555: But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt}
  9556: How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt}
  9557: The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt}
  9558: Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt}
  9559: '...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn''t that horrible-worrible...?${prompt}'
  9560: |-
    Ah, forgive me!
    I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.
    Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt}
  9561: This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt}
  9562: |-
    Either that...or could it be...
    This card has no respective Cardian?
    That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt}
  9563: |-
    ${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!
    I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt}
  9564: |-
    Have you heard?
    Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt}
  9565: Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Tour des Cieux, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt}
  9566: Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt}
  9567: He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt}
  9568: Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt}
  9569: D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt}
  9570: These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt}
  9571: We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt}
  9572: Tour des Cieux is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt}
  9573: We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt}
  9574: Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt}
  9575: He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt}
  9576: ${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt}
  9577: Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt}
  9578: After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
  9579: Semih Lafihna!?${prompt}
  9580: Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt}
  9581: I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Tour des Cieux immediately!${prompt}
  9582: The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt}
  9583: |-
    The bearer of darkness!?
    What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  9584: We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt}
  9585: I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt}
  9586: The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt}
  9587: Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt}
  9588: And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt}
  9589: 'Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2}'
  9590: Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt}
  9591: Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt}
  9592: '...?${prompt}'
  9593: Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt}
  9594: I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt}
  9595: |-
    But I figured-ethy, considering who...
    I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt}
  9596: So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt}
  9597: Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt}
  9598: What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt}
  9599: Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt}
  9600: |-
    What to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    We must save him!
    Leave him to rot!${prompt}
  9601: Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt}
  9602: I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt}
  9603: Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
  9604: And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
  9605: |-
    Help Apururu?
    ${selection-lines}
    Leave it to me!
    Leave him to rot!${prompt}
  9606: I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt}
  9607: ${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt}
  9608: Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt}
  9609: If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
  9610: I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt}
  9611: |-
    ...
    I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt}
  9612: Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt}
  9613: This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt}
  9614: 'What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1}'
  9615: '...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}'
  9616: What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt}
  9617: I...${prompt}
  9618: I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt}
  9619: The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt}
  9620: There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt}
  9621: You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt}
  9622: '...${prompt}'
  9623: Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt}
  9624: And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
  9625: Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt}
  9626: |-
    ...
    A summoning...${prompt}
  9627: That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt}
  9628: Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt}
  9629: If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt}
  9630: ${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
  9631: ${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt}
  9632: The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt}
  9633: |-
    ...
    I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt}
  9634: 'This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  9635: |-
    ......
    Grrr...${prompt}
  9636: Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt}
  9637: I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt}
  9638: Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt}
  9639: What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt}
  9640: Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt}
  9641: I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt}
  9642: This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt}
  9643: Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt}
  9644: Has something happened within Tour des Cieux? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt}
  9645: According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt}
  9646: |-
    ...
    I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt}
  9647: Tour des Cieux has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt}
  9648: The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt}
  9649: |-
    ...
    Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
  9650: Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt}
  9651: M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt}
  9652: |-
    ...Wh-what?
    Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt}
  9653: P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt}
  9654: Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt}
  9655: That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt}
  9656: Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt}
  9657: Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt}
  9658: ${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt}
  9659: Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt}
  9660: All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt}
  9661: I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt}
  9662: Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
  9663: It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt}

    Wa-wa-wait!
    That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt}
  9665: You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt}
  9666: But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt}
  9667: |-
    Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...
    I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt}
  9668: Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt}

  9670: '...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt}'
  9671: We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.${prompt}

  9673: '...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt}'
  9674: There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt}
  9675: We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt}
  9676: Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt}
  9677: As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt}

    Oh, adventurer!
    You've brought all three verses!?${prompt}

  9683: My brother should be waiting in Tour des Cieux. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt}
  9684: Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
  9685: I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt}
  9686: You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt}
  9687: If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt}

  9693: Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt}
  9694: It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt}
  9695: I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt}
  9696: I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.${prompt}
  9697: It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt}
  9698: There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt}

  9701: With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...${prompt}
  9702: Maybe she's foundy some clues on how to stop those Cardians. Don't give up, Minister Apururu!${prompt}
  9703: Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.${prompt}
  9704: Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.${prompt}
  9705: The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!${prompt}
  9706: Hmm, I think I'll inventaru one that has a spinning staff attack. That should make a nice breezey-weeze for those hot summer days...${prompt}
  9707: It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...${prompt}
  9708: I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.${prompt}

  9712: There was a place in Kazham where you could feel the power of the land.${prompt}
  9713: Twenty years ago that same grrreat energy overflowed from the plains of Sarutabaruta. All of our trrroubles began with the loss of that power.${prompt}
  9714: After the Great War, the Star Sibyl kept the truth of events from Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I cannot go on.
    No, I will try harrrder.${prompt}

  9745: When you feel the bow no longer rrresponds to your inner conflict, rrreturn it here to me.${prompt}
  9746: The bow still appears to rrretain the greenness of youth, and your doubt has yet to be rrresolved.${prompt}
  9747: There is no need for haste. The sapling grrrows slowly into the forest giant.${prompt}
  9748: This bow is no longer the sapling I gave you. It has become a mighty tree, grown straight and strong and true.${prompt}

    I am with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (AMAN) and am now taking applications for new ${color: 5}mentors${color: 1}.${prompt}
  9815: |-
    What is a mentor, you ask?
    Well, in short, a mentor is an experienced adventurer who is willing to offer some of their time to help out their less traveled companions.${prompt}
  9816: If this sounds like the job for you, then feel free to sign up today.${prompt}
  9817: 'To become a mentor, you must have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'

  9821: SQUARE ENIX will not be held responsible for the actions and/or comments of any mentors. No benefits of any kind will be provided to those who choose to participate in the Mentor Program.${prompt}
  9822: When you agree to participate in the Mentor Program, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood the above terms.${prompt}
  9823: 'I am sorry, but you do not meet the requirements necessary to accept the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  9824: 'Please speak to me again once you have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}. I will then judge whether or not you meet the requirements.${prompt}'
  9825: 'You have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, yes? Then let me check my materials here...${prompt}'
  9826: Congratulations! You are qualified to be a mentor!${prompt}
  9827: My materials here say that you don't meet the requirements. Keep at it!${prompt}
  9828: |-
    Would you like to serve as a mentor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9829: You are now a registered mentor.${prompt}

  9835: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.

    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  9837: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}

  9840: |-
    Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!
    I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt}

    Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!
    When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt}
  9842: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}

    Incredible, kupo!
    You must have nerves of darksteel!
    Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt}
  9844: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  9845: |-
    You haven't earned my really special present yet!
    Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt}
  9846: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  9847: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  9848: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  9849: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  9850: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  9851: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  9852: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  9853: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  9854: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  9855: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  9856: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  9857: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  9858: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  9859: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9860: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  9861: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  9862: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  9863: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  9864: Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt}
  9865: |-
    Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?
    I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt}
  9866: |-
    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  9867: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  9868: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!
    Kupupupu...${prompt}
  9869: |-
    This place is crawling with nasties.
    You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt}
  9870: Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt}
  9871: |-
    I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.
    This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt}
  9872: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt}

  9923: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9924: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9925: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9926: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9927: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9928: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9929: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9930: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9931: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9932: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9933: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9934: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9935: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9936: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9937: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9938: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9939: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9940: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9941: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9942: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9943: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9944: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9945: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  9946: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  9947: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  9948: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9949: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  9950: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  9973: 'The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt}'
  9974: The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt}
  9975: However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt}

  9980: Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.${prompt}
  9981: The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...${prompt}
  9982: It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.${prompt}
  9983: |-
    And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?
    But how...?${prompt}
  9984: That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt}
  9985: But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.${prompt}

    Do you need further explanation?

    It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt}
  9990: What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9991: The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt}
  9992: The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt}
  9993: That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.${prompt}
  9994: Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.${prompt}
  9995: However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9996: Which would mean that even the trackers were unable to locate the whereabouts of the cardinal.${prompt}
  9997: Does this mean that the cardinal has already bid farewell to this world?${prompt}

  10316: |-
    Écoutez bien ! Pour rendre les enfants heureux, vous devez... leur offrir des cadeaux !
    Vous devriez bien réfléchir à ce que vous allez leur donner ! On dit que c'est l'intention qui compte, mais malheureusement, les enfants pensent autrement !${prompt}
  10317: Vous devriez aussi porter un chapeau rouge comme celui que je porte maintenant ! Cela prouvera que vous êtes un joyeux dispensateur, alors les enfants ne penseront pas que vous êtes un creep.${prompt}
  10318: Où pouvez-vous trouver un chapeau ? Eh bien, j'ai vu quelqu'un en vendre par ici plus tôt. Je suis sûr que vous pouvez les trouver si vous cherchez !${prompt}

  10332: Eh bien, c'était intéressant. Qui aurait pensé qu'un de nos arbres de festival se mettrait à marcher? Je suis juste content que ce soit fini.${prompt}
  10333: Cependant, il y a quelque chose qui me dérange toujours... C'est comme un nuage sombre qui plane au-dessus de notre belle ville...${prompt}

  10335: Je ne sais pas ce que ces imposteurs mijotent, mais s'ils pensent ne serait-ce qu'à toucher aux enfants innocents de la ville...${prompt}
  10336: Je déteste demander cela à un étranger, mais vous avez l'air d'être quelqu'un en qui je peux avoir confiance. Pourriez-vous avoir la gentillesse de rechercher le faux apporteur de sourires et de me l'amener pour que nous puissions régler toute cette histoire?${prompt}
  10337: Vous êtes de retour ! Avez-vous pu trouver l'imposteur?${prompt}
  10338: Vous l'avez localisé, mais il a réussi à s'échapper? Eh bien, je suppose que c'est mieux que rien. Maintenant qu'il sait que nous sommes sur ses traces, peut-être qu'il cessera de s'en prendre aux enfants du Royaume.${prompt}
  10339: J'ai entendu d'un autre aimable aventurier que le faux apporteur de sourires distribuait des boîtes étranges aux jeunes... Pourquoi, pour tout ce que je sais, il pourrait y avoir des scorpions vivants cachés dans ces paquets, juste en attente de piquer les petits bouts de nez de tous mes petits amis.${prompt}

  10342: Coupez-les en morceaux et jetez-les sur le feu de camp, c'est ce que je dis. Le seul bon arbre est celui qui fait griller mon marshmallow.${prompt}

    Uh-huh...
    Donc vous l'avez laissé s'échapper... Eh bien, je suppose que c'est ce que je mérite pour avoir fait confiance à un amateur. Ma faute, ma faute.${prompt}
  10352: Un de mes autres contacts m'a dit que le petit gars distribuait une sorte de pâtisserie étrange à tous les enfants. Jusqu'à présent, je n'ai pas entendu parler de cas de diarrhée, mais la journée est encore jeune.${prompt}

    Quoi ?
    Vous voulez quelque chose pour m'avoir aidé ? Eh bien, c'est la célébration de la Starlight. Pourquoi pas ? Vous ne récoltez que ce que vous semez, non ?${prompt}
  10355: Arrrg, cet arbre ambulant a failli marcher sur moi et mon perroquet ! Un pas de plus et je me faisais une nouvelle jambe de bois avec sa tête.${prompt}
  10356: Oui, parlant de jambes de bois, il y a ce drôle de loustic qui rôde à Windurst en prétendant être un apporteur de sourires. Qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec les jambes de bois ? Arrrg, ne t'en soucie pas.${prompt}
  10357: Tu n'as qu'à te soucier du fait que cet imposteur empiète sur mon territoire${prompt}
  10358: Personne, même pas Davy Jones, n'a le droit de jeter l'ancre dans mon port sans ma permission expresse.${prompt}
  10359: Arrrg, tu as l'air d'une âme digne de confiance. Pourrais-tu trouver en ton cœur d'aider un pirate en détresse ?${prompt}
  10360: J'ai un mauvais pressentiment au sujet de cet arbre, et je veux être là si quelque chose tourne mal.${prompt}
  10361: Arrrg, as-tu trouvé ce scélérat et l'as-tu fait marcher sur la planche?${prompt}
  10362: Tu dis qu'il a juste disparu, hein ? Eh bien, je suppose que tu n'es pas à blâmer.${prompt}
  10363: Un de mes autres matelots a dit qu'ils ont vu le faux apporteur de sourires se promener comme une marionnette et distribuer des cadeaux étranges aux enfants.${prompt}

  10647: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  10648: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10649: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  10650: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10651: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10652: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10653: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10654: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10655: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10656: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10657: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10658: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  10659: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'

  10663: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  10664: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  10665: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10666: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10667: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10668: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10669: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10670: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10671: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10672: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10673: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10674: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10675: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10676: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  10677: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10678: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10679: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10680: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10681: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10682: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10683: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10684: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10685: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10686: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10687: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  10688: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10689: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10690: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10691: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  10692: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10693: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

  10697: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  10698: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  10699: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}

  10705: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10706: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}

  10708: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}

  10711: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10712: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10713: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10714: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10715: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10716: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}

  10726: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10727: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10728: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'

  10735: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}

  10739: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10740: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10741: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10742: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10743: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10744: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10745: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10746: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10747: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10748: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}

  10756: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10757: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}

  11923: Out of all the darrrn Mithras in this darrrn town, you decided to talk to me... Well, then I must say you are off to a good start.${prompt}

  11926: Okay, let's back up a bit. You've noticed the rrrecent influx of chocobo owners these past few moons, right?${prompt}
  11927: Well, all those extra birds have the local trainers busier than bees at a honey convention.${prompt}
  11928: I've started hearing rumors that a lot of the stables don't have time to give proper attention to all the chocobos in their care, leaving a lot of the birds weak and hungrrry.${prompt}
  11929: (One guy even told me that the stables here have been selling extra birds to the Timbre Timbers...if you know what I mean!)${prompt}
  11930: Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is, that if we don't do something quick, Vana'diel will be crawling with chocobos so weak and slow, people will start riding rarabs instead.${prompt}
  11931: And that brings me back to why the VCS sent me here--treasure!${prompt}

  11933: And it's called the “Chocobo Hot and Cold Game”!${prompt}

  11935: You look like you've got some time on your hands. Why not give the game a whirl? You have nothing to lose!${prompt}
  11936: We guarantee you'll have fun or your money back! Oh, and did I mention it's frrree to participate?${prompt}
  11937: VCS officials have been spending the past few weeks burying chests filled with tasty treats in secrrret locations all over Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11938: All you have to do is dig 'em up, and they're yours. No strings attached!${prompt}
  11939: What do you say?${prompt}
  11940: Yeah, you could go out and help some lady get her husband ointment to soothe his festerrring pustules, or defeat some Shadow Lord and save the world, but deep down in your heart you know what you really want to do...${prompt}

  11947: Okay, now I know you're all rrready to get started, but I'm required to go over the official VCS rulebook before letting you loose.${prompt}

  11949: 'Anyone who wants to participate in the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game will require a special ${color: 5}chocograph${color: 1} authorizing ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to dig in a cerrrtain area.${prompt}'
  11950: There are several kinds of chocographs for different types of treasure hidden in areas all over Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11951: And once you obtain one, it's yours for life, or until you set your gobbiebag on fire.${prompt}
  11952: Wait... I'm picking up your thoughts... Just where do I get my hands on a chocograph?${prompt}
  11953: Well, don't you worry, because for a limited time, the VCS is giving away two chocographs absolutely frrree to the first three million adventurers who sign up!${prompt}

  11956: Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the burrried treasure in that area.${prompt}
  11957: 'Please note that once your chocobo has gobbled up the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, you''ll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.${prompt}'
  11958: |-
    Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that.
    Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.${prompt}
  11959: When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.${prompt}
  11960: All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.${prompt}
  11961: The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.${prompt}
  11962: When you think you've found the spot...${prompt}
  11963: '...dig and dig, and then dig some more!${prompt}'
  11964: I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt}
  11965: But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt}
  11966: That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt}
  11967: Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt}
  11968: The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt}
  11969: Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt}
  11970: Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt}
  11971: Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt}
  11972: Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt}
  11973: Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt}
  11974: When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt}
  11975: In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.${prompt}
  11976: Remember that.${prompt}
  11977: Okay! Now I think you're finally rrready to head out there and start digging!${prompt}
  11978: Let me get you your two complimentary licenses...${prompt}

  12194: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  12195: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  12196: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  12197: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  12198: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  12199: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  12200: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12201: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12202: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12203: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12204: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  12205: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  12206: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  12207: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  12208: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12209: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12210: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12211: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12212: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12213: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}

  12487: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  12488: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  12489: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}
  12490: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt}
  12491: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  12492: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

  12496: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  12497: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  12503: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12504: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12505: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12506: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12507: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12508: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12509: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12510: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12511: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12512: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12513: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12514: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12515: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12516: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12517: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12518: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12519: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12520: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12521: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12522: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12523: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12524: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12525: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12526: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12527: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12528: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12529: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12530: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  12531: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12533: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12534: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12535: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12536: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12537: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12538: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12539: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12540: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12541: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12542: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12543: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12544: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12545: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12546: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12547: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12548: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12549: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12550: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12551: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12553: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12554: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12555: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12556: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12557: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12558: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12559: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12560: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12561: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12562: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12563: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12564: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12565: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12566: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12567: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12568: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12569: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12570: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12571: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12572: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12573: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12574: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  12575: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  12641: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12642: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12643: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12644: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12645: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12646: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12647: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12648: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12649: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12650: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12651: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12652: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12653: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12654: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12655: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12656: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12657: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12658: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12659: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  12660: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  12661: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12662: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12663: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12664: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12665: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12666: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12667: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12668: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12669: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12670: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12672: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  12673: |-
    ★Dueler's Race★

  12741: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  12742: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  12743: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12744: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12745: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12746: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12747: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12748: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12749: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12750: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'

  12760: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12761: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12762: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12763: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12764: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12765: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12766: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12767: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...

  12775: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12776: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12777: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12778: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12779: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12780: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12781: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12782: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12783: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12784: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12785: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12786: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12787: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12788: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12789: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12790: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12791: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12792: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12793: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12794: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12795: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12796: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12797: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12798: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12799: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12800: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12801: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12802: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12803: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  12804: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  12805: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  12806: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  12807: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  12808: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12809: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  12810: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  12811: Today's guest is Tour des Cieux's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  12812: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  12813: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  12814: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  12815: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  12816: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  12817: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  12818: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12819: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12820: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12821: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12822: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12823: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12824: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12825: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12826: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12827: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12828: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12829: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12830: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12831: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12832: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12833: And they're off!
  12834: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12835: Well, I fel--
  12836: ピヨピヨッ！
  12837: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12838: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12839: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12840: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12841: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  12842: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12843: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12844: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12845: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12846: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12847: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12848: ピヨピヨ！
  12849: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12850: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12851: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12852: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12853: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12854: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12855: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12856: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  12857: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12858: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12859: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  12860: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  12861: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12862: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12863: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  12864: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12865: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  12866: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12867: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12868: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12869: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  12870: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12871: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12872: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  12873: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12874: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  12875: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  12876: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  12877: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  12878: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  12879: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  12880: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  12881: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  12882: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  12883: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  12884: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  12885: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  12886: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  12887: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  12888: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  12889: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  12890: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  12891: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  12892: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  12893: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  12894: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  12895: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  12896: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  12897: Until next time, race fans...
  12898: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  12899: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12900: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  12901: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12902: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12903: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  12904: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  12905: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  12906: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  12920: With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt}
  12921: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  12922: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  12923: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  12924: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  12925: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  12926: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  12927: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  12928: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  12929: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  12930: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  12931: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  12932: But...?${prompt}
  12933: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12934: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  12935: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  12936: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  12937: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  12938: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  12939: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  12940: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  12941: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  12942: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  12943: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  12944: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  12945: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  12946: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  12947: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  12948: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  12949: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  12950: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  12951: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  12952: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  12953: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  12954: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  12955: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  12956: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12957: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  12958: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  12959: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  12960: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  12961: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  12962: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  12963: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  12964: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  12965: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  12966: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  12967: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  12968: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  12969: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  12970: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  12971: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  12972: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  12973: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  12974: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  12975: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  12976: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  12977: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  12978: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  12979: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  12980: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  12981: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  12982: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  12983: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  12984: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  12985: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  12986: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  12987: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  12988: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  12989: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  12990: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  12991: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  12992: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  12993: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  12994: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  12995: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  12996: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  12997: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  12998: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  12999: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  13000: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13001: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13002: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  13003: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  13004: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  13005: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  13006: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  13007: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  13008: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  13009: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13010: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13011: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  13012: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  13013: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  13014: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  13015: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  13016: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13017: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  13018: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13019: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  13020: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  13021: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  13022: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  13023: '...${prompt}'
  13024: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  13025: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  13026: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  13027: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  13028: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  13029: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  13030: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  13031: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  13032: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  13033: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  13034: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  13035: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  13036: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  13037: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  13038: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  13039: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  13040: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  13041: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  13042: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  13043: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  13044: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  13045: '...${prompt}'
  13046: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  13047: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  13048: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  13049: What's more...${prompt}
  13050: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  13051: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13052: What...?${prompt}
  13053: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  13054: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  13055: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  13056: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  13057: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  13058: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13059: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  13060: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  13061: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  13062: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  13063: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  13064: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  13065: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  13066: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13067: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13068: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  13069: And they're off!
  13070: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  13071: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  13072: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  13073: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  13074: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  13075: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  13076: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  13077: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  13078: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13079: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13080: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  13081: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13082: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  13083: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13084: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13085: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  13086: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  13087: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  13088: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  13089: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  13090: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  13091: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  13092: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  13093: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  13094: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  13095: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  13096: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  13097: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  13098: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  13099: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  13100: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  13101: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  13102: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  13103: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  13104: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  13105: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  13106: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  13107: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  13108: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  13109: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  13110: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  13111: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  13112: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  13113: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  13114: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  13115: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  13116: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  13117: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  13118: |-
    You see a single, ivory ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} die on the table.
    There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 1} other players wishing to participate.${prompt}

    What would you like to do?

    Join table (${number: 2} gil).
    Leave.
    Read manual.${prompt}
  13120: 'There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 8} players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)'
  13121: 'You place ${number: 6} gil in the pot.${prompt}'

    Double up? (Currently: ${number: 0})
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13125: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    Your ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} total is now ${number: 0}!
  13126: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    BUST!!!

  13133: 'The winner is ${entity: 0}!${prompt}'
  13134: Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.${prompt}
  13135: The final place at the table has already been taken.${prompt}
  13136: You do not have enough gil.${prompt}
  13137: Someone has dropped the die!${prompt}

    Read which chapter?
    ${selection-lines}
    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  13139: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  13140: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  13141: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  13142: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  13143: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  13144: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  13145: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'
  13146: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  13147: Hey, I remember you! You're that ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lady] that helped me round up all those new recruits...I think. I'm not that good with faces...${prompt}
  13148: No wait, I remember now! You took one of our badges around Windurst and got people talking about the Sentinels...I think. You adventurers look so much alike...${prompt}
  13149: Anyway, as a way to say thanks for all the help I think I recall you doing for us, the president herself has given me the OK to teleport you directly to Aht Urhgan Whitegate at any time you like!${prompt}
  13150: 'All you have to do is trade me the tiny fee of ${number: 0} gil, and we can be on our way!${prompt}'
  13151: Alright, it looks like everything is in order.${prompt}
  13152: Now hold on!

    Visit the Chocobo Circuit?

  13154: The door is locked...${prompt}
  13155: I am Zahsa Syalmhaia, captain of the mercenaries in charge of defending East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  13156: And now, a question for you, adventurer--might you know the reason why Windurst's Mithran population is concentrated in the Woods district?${prompt}
  13157: |-
    Hmph! Then I shall enlighten you.
    The area was given to us as a reward for our exceptional performance during the Great War!${prompt}
  13158: I am Zahsa Syalmhaia, captain of the mercenaries in charge of defending East Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  13159: And now, a question for you, adventurer--do you know of the stone maws being found across the land? Some might describe them as “cavernous.”${prompt}
  13160: |-
    Hmph! Then I shall enlighten you.
    They are large statues of hideous visage, and have been around for some time. These maws are more than they appear, I guarantee you.${prompt}
  13161: Oh my!${prompt}
  13162: That wristband!${prompt}
  13163: Why, if it isn't one of the charm bracelets I crafty-wafted for our stalwartaru soldiers back in the days of the Great War!${prompt}
  13164: |-
    Ahhh...just seeing it really bringy-wings me back.
    Though I see that two of the threads have come undone.${prompt}
  13165: |-
    Look at how they dangle from your wristaru.
    The shape they form almost looks like a ladle...ah!${prompt}
  13166: |-
    ...That reminds me.
    You must be curious about the secretaru of the third string.${prompt}
  13167: |-
    A ladle with a holey-wole in it...
    This is said to represent the mystic power of Lake Tepokalipuka's waters.${prompt}
  13168: A secret once known to my ancestarus, but long since lost to the ages...${prompt}
  13169: |-
    And yet somehow, I feel that I finally understand...
    Tepoka...lipuka...
    Yes, it musty-wust be--${prompt}
  13170: |-
    Master Pononooo!
    You promised you'd give me some pointarus on my weaving technique!${prompt}
  13171: Oh! How could I forgetaru?${prompt}
  13172: |-
    I wish I had more time to chat, but an artisan's guild comes first and foremostaru, you see.
    Please excusey-wuse me, and do take care!${prompt}
  13173: |-
    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  13174: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}
  13175: |-
    Where would you like to go?

    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  13176: See you again, kupo!${prompt}
  13177: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  13178: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  13179: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}
  13180: |-
    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  13181: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  13182: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  13183: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  13184: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  13185: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  13186: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  13187: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  13188: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}

    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  13206: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  13207: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  13208: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  13209: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  13210: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  13211: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  13212: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  13213: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  13214: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  13215: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  13216: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  13217: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  13218: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  13219: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}

    My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel.
    I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy.
    With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.${prompt}
  13319: Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.${prompt}
  13320: |-
    This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well.
    Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.${prompt}
  13321: |-
    So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?
    Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt}
  13322: Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13323: Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13324: Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
  13325: Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt}
  13326: |-
    As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.
    There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt}
  13327: |-
    Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.
    For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt}
  13328: 'Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13329: |-
    There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...
    Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”
    This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt}
  13330: |-
    Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.
    Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt}
  13331: |-
    For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.
    Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.
    Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt}
  13332: |-
    One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.
    Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt}
  13333: |-
    Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...
    Are you with me so far?${prompt}
  13334: |-
    So far so good?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain Signet again.
    Explain meals again.
    This is a breeze.${prompt}
  13335: |-
    Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.
    Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  13336: |-
    After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.
    Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt}
  13337: |-
    Check out the full belly on you! Well done!
    Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.
    This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt}
  13338: |-
    Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!
    No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt}
  13339: Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt}
  13340: |-
    Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.
    This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt}
  13341: Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt}
  13342: And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt}
  13343: It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt}
  13344: Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt}
  13345: When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    “Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.
    “Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt}
  13347: |-
    “Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.
    And on, and on, and on...${prompt}
  13348: |-
    Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.
    This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt}
  13349: |-
    The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5.
    So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt}
  13350: |-
    Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?
    Very good!${prompt}
  13351: |-
    I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.
    Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt}
  13352: |-
    These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.
    It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt}
  13353: Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt}
  13354: |-
    If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.
    They may pay dividends later on...${prompt}
  13355: |-
    Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.
    The items you will no doubt come across known as “crystals,” such as ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, are extremely significant.${prompt}
  13356: |-
    They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.
    These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt}
  13357: For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt}
  13358: |-
    But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and last but not least, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  13359: |-
    Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.
    Once there, select the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ${item-singular: 2[2]} as the ingredients to be added.${prompt}
  13360: All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt}
  13361: |-
    You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.
    Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt}
  13362: The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt}
  13363: The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt}
  13364: |-
    My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.
    One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt}
  13365: |-
    Are you still with me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain synthesis again.
    Explain the auction house again.
    Sure am.${prompt}
  13366: Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
  13367: |-
    You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
    Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
  13368: |-
    So, you were able to locate the auction house!
    Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
  13369: |-
    What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
    It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
  13370: |-
    And now down to brass tacks!
    Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
  13371: There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
  13372: 'For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}'
  13373: These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
  13374: |-
    There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
    The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
  13375: |-
    Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
    You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
  13376: |-
    As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
  13377: |-
    Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
    And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
    I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
  13378: |-
    With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
    Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
  13379: |-
    Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
    Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
  13380: |-
    A bit of bad news now, though.
    Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
  13381: |-
    As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
    You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
  13382: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
  13383: |-
    Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
    It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  13384: |-
    Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
    Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
  13385: |-
    Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
    In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
  13386: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items work in the same manner as the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier.
    That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
  13387: |-
    All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
    There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
    It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
  13388: |-
    It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
    Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
  13389: '${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}'
  13390: |-
    You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
    It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
  13391: |-
    Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
    Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
  13392: |-
    Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
    If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
  13393: |-
    I know those smells...
    You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13394: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
  13395: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
  13396: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
  13397: If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
  13398: |-
    Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
    You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
  13399: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
  13400: |-
    I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
    I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
  13401: |-
    Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
    You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
  13402: |-
    I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
    Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
  13403: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  13404: |-
    But don't go getting too cocky!
    This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
  13405: |-
    Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
    I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
  13406: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
  13407: |-
    Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
    You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
  13408: |-
    There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
    Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
  13409: |-
    And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
    The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
  13410: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
  13411: 'I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}'
  13412: 'Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}'
  13413: |-
    There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
    Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
  13414: 'Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}'
  13415: |-
    Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
    And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
  13416: |-
    This shall be your final assignment.
    Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
  13417: |-
    Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
    Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13418: |-
    And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
    As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
  13419: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
  13420: |-
    Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
    Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
  13421: |-
    Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
    You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
  13422: 'And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13423: |-
    I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
    From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
  13424: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
  13425: |-
    Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
    It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
  13426: |-
    I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
    It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
  13427: |-
    There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
    Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
    I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
  13428: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13429: |-
    Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13430: |-
    Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13431: |-
    Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13432: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing just now.
    Search comments.
    Skillchains.
    Magic bursts.
    Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
  13433: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
  13434: |-
    There are several different categories of search comments.
    These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
  13435: Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
  13436: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
  13437: Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
  13438: |-
    Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
    You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
  13439: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
  13440: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
  13441: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
  13442: Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
  13443: |-
    In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
    Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
  13444: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
  13445: |-
    One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
    It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
  13446: |-
    The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
    It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
  13447: |-
    Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
    You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
  13448: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
  13449: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
  13450: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
  13451: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
  13452: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
  13453: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
  13454: |-
    Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):
    Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),
    Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),
    Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).${prompt}
  13455: |-
    Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder),
    Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).${prompt}
  13456: |-
    Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder),
    Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).${prompt}
  13457: Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!${prompt}
  13458: We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.${prompt}
  13459: Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!${prompt}
  13460: Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!${prompt}
  13461: 'Ah, you''ve brought ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! Here, this is for you!${prompt}'
  13462: Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!${prompt}
  13463: If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.${prompt}
  13464: Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!${prompt}
  13465: |-
    How many tokens will you exchange?
    ${selection-lines}
    The whole kaboodle!
    I'm a miser. Just the one, please.${prompt}
  13466: That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who dared!${prompt}
  13467: 'Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt}'
  13468: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!
    As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.${prompt}
  13469: |-
    For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record!
    But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.${prompt}
  13470: We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?${prompt}
  13471: |-
    Help the moogles?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sign me up!
    I'm a little busy, sorry.${prompt}
  13472: |-
    We understand...
    But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!${prompt}
  13473: |-
    You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo!
    Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.${prompt}
  13474: Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.${prompt}
  13475: Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.${prompt}
  13476: And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?${prompt}
  13477: Happy delivering, kupo!${prompt}
  13478: Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!${prompt}
  13479: Here's a little something for your kindness.${prompt}
  13480: You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?${prompt}
  13481: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!
    As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.${prompt}
  13482: We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?${prompt}
  13483: |-
    Help the moogles?
    ${selection-lines}
    But of course!
    I help no one but myself.${prompt}
  13484: |-
    You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo!
    Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.${prompt}
  13485: If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.${prompt}
  13486: 'Let'' see... This addressee of this card is a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.${prompt}'
  13487: Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.${prompt}
  13488: |-
    Ah, you've brought us a card!
    Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.${prompt}
  13489: We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!${prompt}
  13490: Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.${prompt}
  13491: |-
    Capacity-challenged adventurers, come one, come all, kupo!
    The Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has developed the supreme solution for your storage woes!${prompt}
  13492: |-
    Ah, another adventurer has arrived to take advantage of world-renowned moogle altruism and artisanship!
    Rest assured that you will not depart disappointed, my friend.${prompt}
  13493: Feast your eyes on the stylish, fashionable Mog Sack!${prompt}
  13494: |-
    Why, it's the perfect union of form and function!
    Who could ask for more, kupo?${prompt}
  13495: |-
    What's more, its carrying capacity can be customized to meet its owner's needs.
    Greedaloxes and Grand Greedaloxes haven't seen anything like this!${prompt}
  13496: |-
    And it can be yours--yes, yours!--for the low, low price of only ${number: 1} gil!
    Why, that's ${number: 2} gil off the moogle manufacturer's suggested retail price.${prompt}
  13497: |-
    That's right, we at the MHMU don't care how far into debt we go this time!
    Why, I personally would starve to death in the streets of San d'Oria to free adventurers the world over from inventory frustration! So how about it, kupo?${prompt}
  13498: |-
    Kupo? (Current gil: ${number: 2})
    ${selection-lines}
    Buy a mog sack. (${number: 1} gil)
    Expand your mog sack.
    About mog sacks.
    About expansion.
    Do nothing.${prompt}
  13499: |-
    I'm sorry, kupo.
    Our special-order mog sacks are limited to one per adventurer.${prompt}
  13500: |-
    Transaction complete, kupo!
    Say goodbye to days of rummaging through your gobbiebag, and hello to a life of haute hupoture, because you are now the proud owner of a spectacular, snazzy, state-of-the-art mog sack!${prompt}
  13501: |-
    We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo?
    Will you not be content until every last moogle is in the poorhouse!? <Sniff>...<sob>... ${prompt}
  13502: Oh dear! I almost forgot the most important part, kupo!${prompt}
  13503: Looking to expand your mog sack? You've come to the right place, kupo!${prompt}
  13504: |-
    A little dose of moogle magic, and...voila, kupo!
    Your mog sack can now hold an incredible ${choice: 0}[/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] items!${prompt}
  13505: '${color-alt: 15}You hear the disconcerting sound of fabric being stretched to its limits...'
  13506: |-
    There you go, kupo!

  14045: Windurstians have always been receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things. That's why I'm so excitarued to put my many talents to use here!${prompt}
  14046: I guess the institute has some of my colleagues posted in San d'Oria and Bastok looking for subjectarus, too, but their small victories will surely pale in comparison to my series of conquestarus!${prompt}
  14047: Oh no, I've done it again...${prompt}

  14052: Excellentaru! I knew I could turn that frown upside down!${prompt}

    Phew! Is it just me, or is it stuffy out here?
    Hmm? You want to learn more about Trustaru?${prompt}
  14057: |-
    Inquire about what?
    ${selection-lines}
    What Trust is.
    What happens when one uses Trust.
    How to learn new Trust spells.
    Whereabouts of Trust participants.
    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  14058: Trust is a new type of magic inventarued by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies and unveiled at our recent international symposium.${prompt}
  14059: As any Aurastery student could tell you, most magic taps into the aetheric energies of the caster, draining them. “Trust,” however, relies on the spiritual energy which develops between two souls bound closely by love and friendship.${prompt}
  14060: That means you can use it regardless of your job-wob! Isn't that almost as fantastic as my hairstyle?${prompt}
  14061: There's one small caveataru--you should never use this magic within city walls. Regulations and all.${prompt}
  14062: Using Trust magic brings out an alter ego of someone who you have a special-wecial relationship with.${prompt}
  14063: However, no matter how powerful-wowerful your friends are, when you call forth their alter ego, it will only be as strong as you. ${prompt}
  14064: You must surely be fascinated with all this, thanks to my clear-cut explanation. You want to know what's even more fascinating? That the alter ego will fightaru alongside you!${prompt}
  14065: Of course, you won't be able to give the alter ego you summon specific instructions-wuctions. This is your friend we're talking about; you don't go barking orders at friends, right?${prompt}
  14066: So if the alter ego you summon runs off and gets into trouble, don't get too mad, okay?${prompt}
  14067: To send alter egos back from whence they came, simply tell them so. They'll probably be happy to take a little break-weak.${prompt}
  14068: If its life force runs out, it will retreataru into the aether and vanish from this realm. But fear not--you'll be able to call it back into our world after a certain amount of time has passed.${prompt}
  14069: Trust magic is based in the emotions of trustaru, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love, so you can't summon just anyone. Take me, for example--I'm far too adorable and busy for you to call forth whenever you want.${prompt}
  14070: But there are others willing to help you. Those participating in the Trust initiative may be able to help you if you take the time to chataru with them.${prompt}
  14071: The strength of the bonds you have with them--if any--determine if the magic-wagic will succeed or fail.${prompt}
  14072: If it fails, then you may need to adventure more and make a name for yourself, as I have. Or maybe you need to help solve some problem-woblem they have. It depends!${prompt}

  14101: 'Ah, you found-wound ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}! Why, very impressive indeed!${prompt}'
  14102: You see, Doctaru Monberaux's services are in high demand, meaning he is unable to leave Jeuno. So he said he wants his alter ego to travel-wavel and see the world.${prompt}
  14103: However, during our little talk, I feltaru an icy and jealous stare upon me. I wonder who that was...${prompt}
  14104: Could it have been Wolf... Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter-watter.${prompt}

  14110: Yet I warn you--should the ritual trrruly require strong bonds, then you would be wasting your time--and hers.${prompt}

  14119: I've never been good with words, so I spoke from the heart, telling her exactly what transpired.${prompt}
  14120: When faced with the Emptiness, I fought, proving what true justice is.${prompt}

  14127: But who can ensure that my alter ego will not be a sin in and of itself?${prompt}
  14128: The motherland's leaders are in constant debate about what this new magic can mean for our people.${prompt}
  14129: Does it abide by the natural order of things?${prompt}
  14130: If the alter ego causes a sin, then who is the hunter supposed to track down?${prompt}
  14131: Of course, the queen's stance on these issues is as fickle as a newborn babe.${prompt}
  14132: But the prevailing opinion is that Trust magic is permissible so long as it does not violate the natural order and is undertaken by one who is not apt to cause sin.${prompt}
  14133: 'As such, I received a scroll, and am tasked with finding someone from among ${choice: 2}[us/the] sin hunters to engage in the ritual.${prompt}'
  14134: Who could possibly be more trustworthy than Perih Vashai? I am here today to give the scroll to her.${prompt}
  14135: The reason the scroll found its way to me is because I managed to convince Shikaree Y that Perih Vashai would be more worthy than anyone else.${prompt}
  14136: She knows how to respect the laws of nature, and is as unlikely a person to sin as anyone I know.${prompt}
  14137: Yet for some reason, she refused.${prompt}
  14138: “The natural way of things is not for us to decide. The sky and land have that responsibility.”${prompt}

  14147: No, I do not--cannot--forget where we first fought, and where I first fell.${prompt}
  14148: You went from being a passerby on my life's road to something much greater.${prompt}
  14149: My sisters set the wheel in motion, but it was I who issued the challenge--and you accepted.${prompt}
  14150: You spurred them on to learn the intricacies of the delta attack.${prompt}
  14151: And there are other scents, too--I picture an open expanse of saltwater with each breath I take. It reminds me of Bibiki Bay.${prompt}
  14152: 'Our fights and struggles were noble. We aimed to protect all we held dear: trust, justice, courage, and hope.${prompt}'

  14154: '${choice: 4}[There is yet another./And there are other scents, too.] The fragrance peculiar to Mhaura''s port.${prompt}'
  14155: My journeys with you taught me about the unspoken rules of the land, and I learned of the place my mother's words were meant to guide me to.${prompt}
  14156: If my alter ego can help you, then it is not for me to question whether or not the process itself is a sin.${prompt}
  14157: And yet there's more.${prompt}
  14158: I can taste the fear that I felt when I confessed my true desires to my sisters.${prompt}
  14159: I was afraid when I opened up to them because they might not accept what I had to say.${prompt}
  14160: '...But I know they have changed since they first met you.${prompt}'
  14161: There is also the trace of my sisters carried upon the wind. I have never thanked you for aiding them in their endeavors.${prompt}
  14162: Thank you for helping Shikaree X with her first survey in Tavnazia.${prompt}
  14163: Shikaree X told me the reason she was able to speak like a true sin hunter was that you stood by her side. ${prompt}
  14164: Shikaree Y mentioned that you hurried after her when she took a tuning fork in hand and made for Uleguerand Range.${prompt}
  14165: You know how lightly she always dresses. I would have been worried, too.${prompt}
  14166: The pristine scents from the sky now tell me of another, beautiful time.${prompt}
  14167: The sweet sensation of victory when we vanquished the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  14168: 'Ahhh, what I wouldn''t give for us to gather again, exchanging tales over some ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14169: ${name-player}, can you not hear the voice of nature?${prompt}

  14428: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  14429: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  14430: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  14431: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  14432: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  14433: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  14434: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  14435: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  14436: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  14437: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  14438: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  14439: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14440: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  14441: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  14442: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  14443: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  14444: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  14445: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  14446: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  14447: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  14448: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14449: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  14450: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  14451: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  14452: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  14453: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  14454: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  14455: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  14456: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  14457: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  14458: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  14459: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  14460: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  14461: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14462: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  14463: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  14464: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  14465: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  14466: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  14467: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  14468: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  14469: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  14470: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  14471: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  14472: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  14473: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  14474: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  14475: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  14476: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  14477: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  14478: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  14479: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  14480: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  14481: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  14482: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  14483: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}
  14484: '${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.'

  14840: Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.${prompt}
  14841: The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.${prompt}

  14859: Oh, hello-wello. What is that shield you are carrying?${prompt}
  14860: Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.${prompt}
  14861: Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.${prompt}
  14862: If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.${prompt}
  14863: I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt}
  14864: Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.${prompt}
  14865: 'So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14866: 'This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt}'
  14867: I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt}
  14868: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  14869: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  14870: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  14871: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  14872: So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt}
  14873: 'Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14874: 'After that, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt}'
  14875: I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt}
  14876: You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt}
  14877: That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt}
  14878: Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt}
  14879: You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt}
  14880: 'I see... That''s the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14881: 'This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14882: I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt}
  14883: 'Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14884: 'That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt}'
  14885: Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt}
  14886: 'Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  14887: 'Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I''ll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}'
  14888: You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  14889: It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  14890: Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt}
  14891: No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt}
  14892: That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt}
  14893: That should do it.${prompt}
  14894: Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt}
  14895: Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt}
  14896: Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt}
  14897: You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt}
  14898: You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt}
  14899: 'As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14900: 'You''ll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  14901: Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt}
  14902: 'Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14903: 'Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt}'
  14904: 'The lastaru thing you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I''ve prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  14905: 'You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  14906: That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt}
  14907: Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
  14908: 'Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  14909: Okay, here you go.${prompt}
  14910: 'Ahh, it''s just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}'
  14911: 'Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don''t have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt}'
  14912: My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt}
  14913: Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt}
  14914: Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt}
  14915: There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt}
  14916: This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt}
  14917: Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt}
  14918: Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt}
  14919: 'It''s about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  14920: You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt}
  14921: Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt}
  14922: For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt}
  14923: And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt}
  14924: The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt}
  14925: Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.${prompt}
  14926: Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.${prompt}

  14950: Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.${prompt}
  14951: I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!${prompt}
  14952: Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?${prompt}
  14953: Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.${prompt}
  14954: Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  14955: 'The firstaru two things you''ll need are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  14956: I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt}
  14957: 'The other material-waterial you''ll require is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I can produce it for you once your shield''s Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt}'
  14958: That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.${prompt}
  14959: 'I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it''s finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt}'
  14960: Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt}
  14961: I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt}
  14962: We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  14963: Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt}
  14964: Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt}
  14965: Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt}
  14966: Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt}
  14967: Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.${prompt}
  14968: The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.${prompt}
  14969: Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.${prompt}
  14970: I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.${prompt}
  14971: '0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}'
  14972: Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?${prompt}
  14973: Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt}
  14974: According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.${prompt}
  14975: That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.${prompt}
  14976: I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!${prompt}
  14977: Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt}
  14978: 'So, firrrst, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt}'
  14979: 'Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full value.${prompt}'
  14980: Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.${prompt}
  14981: Did you catch all of that?${prompt}
  14982: 'Come see me when you''ve incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I''ll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt}'
  14983: 'Next on your list are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.${prompt}'
  14984: I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.${prompt}
  14985: You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.${prompt}
  14986: That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.${prompt}
  14987: Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.${prompt}
  14988: You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.${prompt}
  14989: 'Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} no prrroblem.${prompt}'
  14990: 'So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14991: The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt}
  14992: 'Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  14993: 'That''s fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you''ll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14994: Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt}
  14995: 'I don''t believe it... You''rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  14996: 'Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I''ll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14997: You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt}
  14998: It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt}
  14999: Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt}
  15000: I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt}
  15001: Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt}
  15002: That should do it.${prompt}
  15003: Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt}
  15004: Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt}
  15005: Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt}
  15006: This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt}
  15007: I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt}
  15008: 'Now, let''s discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you''ll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  15009: 'You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you''ll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield''s Craftsmanship.${prompt}'
  15010: This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt}
  15011: 'Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I''ll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  15012: 'Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I''ve given both of them to Tergil.${prompt}'
  15013: 'Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I''ve prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  15014: 'You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you''ve cleared them all, you''ll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  15015: That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt}
  15016: Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt}
  15017: 'Wait just a moment. I''ll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt}'
  15018: Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt}
  15019: 'Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}'
  15020: It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt}
  15021: 'Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt}'
  15022: Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt}
  15023: Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt}
  15024: Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt}
  15025: This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt}
  15026: You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt}
  15027: What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt}
  15028: 'That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt}'
  15029: We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt}
  15030: It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt}
  15031: As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt}
  15032: Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt}
  15033: By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt}
  15034: You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt}
  15035: Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt}
  15036: 'Once you complete all of the customer requests, I''ll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} as prrromised. Good luck out there.${prompt}'

  15051: Try not to push yourself too harrrd. Take a rest for now and I'll have another customer for you when you're ready.${prompt}
  15052: Hello. You look like you're feeling better. Indeed, you're not nearrrly as pale as you were before! Okay, let's get down to business, shall we?${prompt}
  15053: Ahh, it seems you've finished the deliverrry to our customer. Nice work!${prompt}
  15054: Yes, I see you've completed the final deliverrry. I knew I could count on you to get it done.${prompt}
  15055: 'Alright, here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]}, just like I promised.${prompt}'
  15056: While I'm sure you'd never lose something so prrrecious, you can use guild points to obtain them again if need be.${prompt}
  15057: I really have come to like this kind of work. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts come to frrruition.${prompt}
  15058: Look! The shield is complete!${prompt}
  15059: Yes, it really does have a nice feel to it! Your skill as a craftsman continues to grrrow without bounds!${prompt}
  15060: Accorrrding to her, the next upgrade should unlock the true power of the shield. I can't wait to see what it becomes!${prompt}
  15061: Oh, I almost forrrgot! I was thinking you could make use of this new crafting technique. Consider it my little gift to you. I hope you can get some use out of it.${prompt}
  15062: Hello there. I see you've rrreached the final upgrade!${prompt}
  15063: You will need to ask about the rrrecipe. All I can tell you is how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  15064: 'Let''s see... First, you''ll rrrequire ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  15065: I've left them with my frrriend Tergil. You just need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt}
  15066: 'Next is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}... I can produce it for you once your shield''s Craftsmanship rrreaches 100%. Just like before, basically.${prompt}'
  15067: That about covers the explanation. This being the final upgrade and all, I expected it to be more difficult, but it sounds prrretty much the same. Hopefully, there's nothing to trip you up out there.${prompt}
  15068: I believe Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno needs this. Be carrreful not to lose it on the way.${prompt}
  15069: Hello. Hm? What's wrrrong?${prompt}
  15070: I see... Yes, I rrreceived the order. I was told to put my very heart and soul into it, so I remember it clearly.${prompt}
  15071: Although, I just sent it off to Jeuno. I never hearrrd that you'd be by to pick it up. If only you'd told me sooner...${prompt}
  15072: Well, I'm sure it's already arrived by now. You should rrreturn to Jeuno and see if it's been delivered. It was addressed to Mewk Chorosap.${prompt}
  15073: Hey, you didn't happen to bring this from Jeuno, did you? This emblem that I worrrked so hard to make...${prompt}
  15074: Hm? You've been searching for this? I wonder how it got here... Perrrhaps it was a ghost? Here, hurry up and get it away from me.${prompt}
  15075: Wait a moment! This must be it! Let me examine it...${prompt}
  15076: I see... I see... This is quite impressive! Just when did you manage to learrrn such skill?${prompt}
  15077: Actually, now that I think about it... You walking around with this thing is the perrrfect way to spread the word about our guild!${prompt}
  15078: I'm glad you showed me this. Here, I have something for you. It will teach you a brrrand new crafting technique.${prompt}
