  7353: Parraggoh's place is the first house down through the big arch to the mining town. It's a rough neighborhood, but Cornelia won't stay out of there.${prompt}

    No? You've come in his place?
    Mister Powhatan is in the tavern, you say?${prompt}

  7362: I'll go meet him in the tavern, then. Don't worry, I know the way.${prompt}
  7363: The client sent an invalid value to the server!${prompt}
  7364: You cannot receive mission assignments at this time.${prompt}

    You cannot undertake two missions at the same time.

  7373: Then move along.${prompt}
  7374: |-
    Good.
    This is your first time going on a mission, is it not?${prompt}
  7375: |-
    Your first assignment is not a difficult one.
    The details are as follows:${prompt}
  7376: |-
    You must go to the Zeruhn Mines in the western section of the Mines District.
    Once there, you are to collect a report from the overseer.${prompt}
  7377: |-
    You can consult the “Mission” section of the main menu to review your objectives.
    Speed and efficiency are your priorities. Dismissed.${prompt}
  7378: |-
    The Chief Engineer is conducting new research, and has asked for someone to assist him.
    He can be found in the Metalworks, to the east of the administrative section.${prompt}
  7379: |-
    The Chief Engineer's laboratory is on the second floor of the Metalworks.
    You don't know his name!? And you call yourself a Bastoker!${prompt}
  7380: |-
    The Chief Engineer's name is Cid. Any Bastoker would know that!
    Now go and see him. He will give you the details of your mission.${prompt}
  7381: The Palborough Mines, once our main source of mythril, have been under beastman control for some time.${prompt}
  7382: 'We want you to hunt these beastmen, the Quadav, and bring back ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} as proof of your accomplishments.${prompt}'
  7383: You must present all four items to me or one of my colleagues in order to complete this mission.${prompt}
  7384: Good, you've brought all four parts of the doll.${prompt}
  7385: |-
    I am raising your rank to 2 for completing this mission.
    Congratulations.${prompt}
  7386: If you've been to the Palborough Mines, you must know now the serious nature of the threat these beastmen pose to our civilization.${prompt}
  7387: As a Bastoker, you are expected to take on more missions and go on conquests to preserve Bastok's brilliant future!${prompt}
  7388: But I cannot give you a new mission at this time.${prompt}
  7389: You need to collect rank points before taking on new missions.${prompt}
  7390: You can receive rank points by participating in conquests and donating the crystals you acquire to guards, or by undertaking missions you've previously completed.${prompt}
  7391: Ask the High Guard near the gatehouse if you wish to hear more about conquests.${prompt}
  7392: Have you heard of a strange structure called the Crag of Dem? It is on the Konschtat Highlands, north of the Gustaberg Mountains.${prompt}
  7393: They say that crystals are drained of their power if you take them to a certain section of that structure.${prompt}
  7394: Chief Cid is currently investigating this strange phenomenon, and is asking for someone to bring back a faded crystal.${prompt}
  7395: Go see him for a more detailed explanation of your objectives.${prompt}
  7396: You want a crystal to use for this experiment? Are you not an adventurer? It should be easy for you to procure one.${prompt}
  7397: 'You are to collect ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} from beasts in the Dangruf Wadi.${prompt}'
  7398: |-
    Senator Alois is in need of some. Do not ask me why.
    He can be found in the President's Office.${prompt}
  7399: |-
    You've acquired quite a reputation.
    There is a new mission for you to tackle.${prompt}
  7400: |-
    First, speak to Sir Naji of the Mythril Musketeers at the President's Office.
    This mission is of great import to the welfare of our nation.${prompt}
  7401: |-
    I see you've made it back safely from your journey to Windurst and San d'Oria.
    This new mission should not be hard for an experienced adventurer like you.${prompt}
  7402: The Mythril Musketeers are planning an offensive on the Quadav stronghold.${prompt}
  7403: Adventurers, including yourself, have been asked to join them on this operation.${prompt}
  7404: You are to go meet Iron Eater, one of the Mythril Musketeers, to receive a full briefing.${prompt}
  7405: The Gusgen Mines in the Konschtat Highlands have been dug to the bare rock and abandoned for some time...${prompt}
  7406: |-
    But lately, there have been reports that a rare ore can be found in them.
    No one has claimed this new vein yet.${prompt}
  7407: You are to bring back a sample of the ore to confirm these reports. A Galka adventurer named Davyad should be able to help you. He is said to have acquired a chunk of the ore when he was there last.${prompt}
  7408: |-
    The item that Davyad brought back was ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. That is what you should seek as well.
    Once you have the ore, hand them over to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  7409: |-
    You have succeeded in bringing back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Good work, adventurer. This discovery may help rejuvenate Bastok's economy!${prompt}
  7410: You have heard of Jeuno, have you not? The Bastokan government is currently looking for someone to send there, and your name is on the list of candidates.${prompt}
  7411: The presidential aide, Sir Lucius himself, recommended you. It is a great honor--you should be proud!${prompt}
  7412: Sir Lucius wishes to see you as soon as possible. Go meet him in his office in the administrative section at the top of the Metalworks.${prompt}
  7413: |-
    I have orders for you from the president himself.
    You must have heard already, but he wants you to go to Fei'Yin.${prompt}
  7414: |-
    Go speak to Sir Naji at the President's Office.
    He will show you in.${prompt}
  7415: So, it has finally come to this... You are to infiltrate the Kindred's main stronghold of Zvahl.${prompt}
  7416: |-
    The president will brief you himself in his office.
    Good luck, adventurer!${prompt}
  7417: |-
    Ah, you have returned from Jeuno.
    Go to the President's Office right away.
    Sir Naji will show you in.${prompt}
  7418: |-
    Take it from me, a guard's job is pretty boring.
    Not that I'd rather have trouble, mind you.${prompt}
  7419: |-
    The North Gate and Beligen Square are down these stairs.
    Cross the drawbridge from the square if you want to get to the residential area.${prompt}
  7420: |-
    Go straight west and you'll come across a goods store and the tavern.
    Further west is the road leading to the Markets District.${prompt}
  7421: |-
    The residential area is on the other side of this drawbridge.
    Cross it while it's down if you need to go to your Mog House.${prompt}
  7422: 'Incoming ship! Everyone off the bridge!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7423: |-
    I'm helping Evelyn with her store.
    She said she'd give me a present if I worked hard!${prompt}
  7424: |-
    You lost?
    Where you goin'?${prompt}
  7425: |-
    Which area do you want to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    None.
    The western section.
    The eastern section.${prompt}
  7426: |-
    All-righty.
    Come back anytime. Have a nice day.${prompt}
  7427: |-
    All right, let's see...
    See all those doors to the west, there?${prompt}
  7428: |-
    The ones on the right are your run-of-the-mill warehouses.
    Some real shady characters've been seen going in there, so you be careful, all right?${prompt}
  7429: |-
    On the left you've got the air travel agency, or “the door to the world,” as they say.
    You need an airship pass to get in, though. And not through that door, either--that's the exit. Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7430: The entrance is around the corner. Once you're in, you gotta walk down to the pier to get on airships.${prompt}
  7431: Airships there only go to Jeuno--but of course, you knew that, right?${prompt}
  7432: |-
    A little further on, we have Galvin's Travel Gear--a goods shop.
    They've got a few things adventurers like yourself might need.${prompt}
  7433: |-
    Above Galvin's, you've got the Steaming Sheep Restaurant, which most people just call “the tavern.”
    It's a good place if you want to eat, drink, or hear a good story or two.${prompt}
  7434: |-
    And further down west...you'll come to a bridge.
    It leads to the Markets District, a nicer part of town.${prompt}
  7435: You can get to both the Metalworks and the Mines District from the markets. It's like the crossroads of Bastok, if you know what I mean.${prompt}
  7436: Okay, to the east--we've got a few houses on the left, a few merchant stalls on the right...${prompt}
  7437: |-
    Oh, those merchants don't have much to sell, by the way.
    They're only useful if you want to sell off stuff you don't need and go back outside right away.${prompt}
  7438: Right, further on down the stairs is...the North Gate!${prompt}
  7439: You can get missions from the guards there or ask to join in conquests.${prompt}
  7440: Just south of the square is one of our major landmarks, the drawbridge!${prompt}
  7441: It's gotta be drawn up when airships come in, so be careful. The residential area on the other side is where your room is. Go there if you need to store stuff.${prompt}
  7442: Oh, but you have to be a Bastoker or have a Rent-a-Room to do that.${prompt}
  7443: That's about it. Come back if you have any more questions, all right?${prompt}
  7444: This building here is where you get on airships. I'm usually here all day, so I hear a lot of stories about things happening in other countries.${prompt}
  7445: |-
    Traveling on airships is a right only given to those who've proven themselves worthy.
    It's still a little early for you, I would think.${prompt}
  7446: I am from San d'Oria. Have you ever gone there? You do not want to. It is a nation trapped in old traditions and foolish rules.${prompt}
  7447: The San d'Orian army is thought the mightiest in Vana'diel, but it is only a shadow of its past self.${prompt}
  7448: I chose to let my soul be ravaged by the cruel wheel of time rather than spend an eternity in that timeless city. Here, at least, I feel alive.${prompt}
  7449: |-
    Rafaela and I love taking walks along this road.
    The sea wind seeps deep and soothes the soul. Do you feel it as well?${prompt}
  7450: |-
    Bastok's sea is the same shade of blue as the one near San d'Oria. They are one and the same.
    I do not long for my homeland anymore...I have Rafaela, now.${prompt}
  7451: Sometimes, as we look at the sea together, Evi gets this real sad look on his face...${prompt}
  7452: And I think, maybe he was never meant to be one of us, and that he should not stay here in Bastok.${prompt}
  7453: Are you looking for something? There is nothing here you would want.${prompt}
  7454: |-
    If you are looking for my daughter Ayame, she is working at the President's Office.
    She does not come back home often.${prompt}
  7455: Everyone says that they're all proud of sis.${prompt}
  7456: |-
    I am, too--she's strong, cool, and smart.
    I'm not any of those...I can never be like her.${prompt}
  7457: The Humes were planning on raising a new building here.${prompt}
  7458: But when the Hume head engineer switched departments, they canceled the whole project, leaving us out to dry. I hate Hume bureaucracy.${prompt}
  7459: There's nothing to see here. Just another forgotten Hume project, where we Galka did all the work and were left with nothing to show for our sweat and toil.${prompt}
  7460: |-
    It's a great day, isn't it?
    Bastok has changed. There's that drawbridge there, and airships in the air...
    But the sun still shines as brightly as when we were children.${prompt}
  7461: This used to be the secret place where young lovers met. Qiji and I used to come here, too, before we moved in together.${prompt}
  7462: |-
    People say the drawbridge is getting old, but it looks as sturdy to me as the first time I laid eyes on it.
    If anything has changed, it must be something within us...${prompt}
  7463: I'm happy that my granddaughter likes me, but I must say I have trouble keeping up with her at my age.${prompt}
  7464: |-
    C'mon, Grandma!
    Over here!${prompt}
  7465: |-
    I don't know what's wrong with my son. He stays home all day and does nothing.
    I wish there were something I could do.${prompt}
  7466: |-
    Leave me alone! I don't wanna go outside!
    I'm safe here...no one can hurt me...${prompt}
  7467: It pays better to work for the Humes in this district than to dig in the mines.${prompt}
  7468: Those good-for-nothing hard-heads in the Mines District don't know what they're missing.${prompt}
  7469: |-
    Can I help you? No, you can't store personal items here.

    I've seen some real shady characters going into the warehouse next door. I wonder what kind of business they're in?
    Actually, never mind. I don't want to know.${prompt}
  7471: We came all the way here from Windurst hoping to make some quick gil, but business has been rrreally slow...almost as slow as Panana's Cures.${prompt}
  7472: I really don't like fighting, but Konty here takes us to dangerous places all the time!${prompt}
  7473: Why did I ever agree to leave Windurst? I wanna go home... <Sigh>${prompt}
  7474: |-
    Hey, you a rookie?
    If I were you, I'd go hunt lizards.
    They're worth the trouble--take my word for it.${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Cross this bridge to go to the Markets District.
    Also take this road to get to the Metalworks--which include forges and administrative buildings--and the Mines District.${prompt}
  7476: An Elvaan knight named Domien?${prompt}
  7477: Yes, I believe I've seen someone matching that description walk by earlier...wait, is that him?${prompt}
  7478: 'That ${item-singular: 7[2]}...are you Powhatan?${prompt}'
  7479: |-
    You're his representative?
    No matter--you should know that being late to a meeting is rude, not to say unforgivable, where I am from.${prompt}
  7480: |-
    I have written a letter of complaint to Mister Powhatan.
    Give it to him--I am going back to Jeuno.
    Goodbye.${prompt}
  7481: |-
    What's wrong with me?
    I'm too scared to go outside...I want to hide in a small, narrow place...${prompt}
  7482: |-
    I need something big enough to hide my whole body!
    Do you have something like that? Can you find one for me? Please?${prompt}
  7483: |-
    Yes, yes! This is great!
    Finally, I can sleep in peace!
    I'm never going out again! Hah hah!${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Ah, it's you!
    That shell you gave me is great!
    I must've been a turtle in a past life!${prompt}
  7485: You! You're the one who gave my son that cursed thing, aren't you!?${prompt}
  7486: Thanks to you, not only does he never go out, he stays in that shell all day!${prompt}
  7487: Do something! Isn't there anything you can do to make him come out of his shell?${prompt}
  7488: |-
    It's your fault, Panana! I knew I shouldn't have let you talk me into going to Beadeaux!
    Now I've got these itchy bugs all over me!${prompt}
  7489: |-
    That's not my fault!
    I did warn you about looking for treasure-pleasure inside Quadav shells!${prompt}
  7490: |-
    Everyone knows they're full of ${item-plural: 7[2]}!
    You have to be careful when you touch them!${prompt}
  7491: |-
    Don't you know the saying, “putting ${item-plural: 7[2]} in a Quadav shell”?
    It means, “stirring up trouble!”${prompt}
  7492: |-
    What is this?
    Ah, of course! “Putting ${item-plural: 7[2]} in a Quadav shell!”
    All I have to do is put this nasty little thing in my son's shell, right?${prompt}
  7493: |-
    I'll go do it right away!
    Come back later--I'll give you a reward if it works!${prompt}
  7494: My shell became really itchy all of a sudden...${prompt}
  7495: Now I wonder why I wanted to hide in that thing in the first place...${prompt}
  7496: |-
    Oh, there you are!
    That trick of yours worked!
    Now, if only my son would go out...
    Anyway, here's something for your trouble.${prompt}
  7497: I'm telling you, it's those Quadav. They must've put some kind of curse on him!${prompt}
  7498: My neighbor Ensetsu's daughter, Ayame, is quite a remarkable girl. Have you met her yet?${prompt}
  7499: She's always been very bright. She became a samurai when she was little, and now she made it to the top and became a Mythril Musketeer!${prompt}
  7500: Only the top five Musketeers can join their ranks, you know. Ensetsu must be proud that Ayame was chosen to be one!${prompt}
  7501: |-
    Now, if only her sister Kaede were a little more like her.
    She's so quiet and unremarkable...but I suppose children should be seen and not heard.${prompt}
  7502: |-
    I never see much of Corann... Oh, that's the son of my neighbor Ronan.
    I think he stays cooped up in his room all day.${prompt}
  7503: He's like a turtle in its shell... So much so that some people even say that the turtle people cast a curse on him when he was born!${prompt}
  7504: |-
    The tavern's up these steps.
    The goods shop and the bridge leading to the Markets District is straight to the west.${prompt}
  7505: |-
    To the east is the North Gate and the drawbridge leading to the residential area.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  7506: I started working for the air travel agency hoping to become an airship pilot someday, but all they make me do is move boxes and crates.${prompt}
  7507: |-
    Maybe I should've gone to Jeuno instead.
    Jeuno is where all the airships go, you know?
    Like that saying, “All routes lead to Jeuno,” or something like that.${prompt}
  7508: Due to technical difficulties, we cannot issue World Passes at this time.${prompt}
  7509: |-
    This is where we issue World Passes.
    A World Pass allows you to invite people from other worlds to join you.${prompt}
  7510: 'Your World Pass is: “${entity: 0}.”${prompt}'
  7511: Be warned that you can only invite a limited number of people to this world with your World Pass.${prompt}
  7512: This is such a great location... I wish the Humes hadn't dropped the whole project.${prompt}
  7513: |-
    You should've seen us when the foreman was still here!
    We were busy like bees, but happy as lambs to take part in this big project.
    But look at us now.${prompt}
  7514: |-
    The foreman took it the hardest. He disappeared when the project was canceled.
    I think his dog went with him, too.${prompt}
  7515: |-
    I wonder what happened to him?
    It's still a little too early for him to have left on his journey of rebirth...${prompt}
  7516: |-
    Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you?
    Can you tell me if you hear anything about our foreman or his dog?${prompt}
  7517: The foreman told me not to tell anyone, but he said he was going to the big hill in North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  7518: He told me that he'd be gone for a while, so he asked me to take care of his dog for him while he was away.${prompt}
  7519: |-
    But the day after the foreman left, his dog disappeared, too.
    I hope they're both all right...${prompt}
  7520: |-
    Hey...the foreman's dog used to wear this collar.
    What would an undead cur--in North Gustaberg, of all places--be doing with it?${prompt}
  7521: Some say that when you die, the regret you have about things you left undone could turn you into an undead, but...is this possible?${prompt}
  7522: If that was the foreman's dog you fought, then that would mean the foreman is also...${prompt}
  7523: |-
    No, he cannot be.
    He must have already reincarnated into a new body. He used to say that this project might be his last job...${prompt}
  7524: I just wish we could've finished it, for the foreman's sake.${prompt}
  7525: |-
    In any case, I should thank you for this bit of news, be it good or ill.
    Here, take this. It isn't much, but it should come in handy.${prompt}
  7526: |-
    The stamp hunt, right?
    Yes, you're not the first adventurer who has come to me asking for it.
    Here you go.${prompt}
  7527: You received a stamp!${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Hunting what? Oh, stamps.
    Right, I'm supposed to give those out, too.
    Here.${prompt}
  7529: |-
    I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking out for here.
    Sure, there are those griping Galka at the construction site and shady dealings in the warehouses, but those are nothing new.${prompt}
  7530: |-
    I need a favor.
    I want to give my wife Romilda here a present.${prompt}
  7531: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} should do nicely...could you go get me one?${prompt}'
  7532: |-
    Oh! The ${item-singular: 7[2]}!
    But I'm a little too embarrassed to give it to her myself...could you do it for me?${prompt}
  7533: |-
    My! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, for me?
    Why, that's very nice of you!${prompt}
  7534: |-
    Qiji, look at what this nice person gave me!
    And you haven't given me a present in ages!
    Shame on you!${prompt}
  7535: B-but, that's--${prompt}
  7536: |-
    Thank you very much!
    I've wanted one of these for the longest time.
    It's as if you read my mind!${prompt}
  7537: Uh...${prompt}
  7538: |-
    Well, as long as she's happy, I can't complain.
    Here's something for your trouble.${prompt}
  7539: |-
    Yes? Of course I know that present was from my husband, dear.
    He thinks I'm hard of hearing, but he's the one who can't even hear himself talk!${prompt}
  7540: |-
    In fact, this isn't the first time he's done this.
    But you know what? It's a wonderful thing to receive a gift from someone who loves you, no matter how many times, or how old you are.${prompt}
  7541: |-
    I should give Qiji something back for his present this time, too.
    Would you be kind enough to go find me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, dear?${prompt}
  7542: |-
    Oh, and don't worry, I can give them to him myself.
    Men are such cowards!${prompt}
  7543: |-
    Ah, you've brought them.
    Thank you.
    Here's something for you.${prompt}
  7544: |-
    Hmm? You! What are you giving her?
    Is that some present from another man!?${prompt}
  7545: |-
    Oh, don't be foolish, Qiji.
    This nice person just brought me what I asked for--a present from me to you.
    Here.${prompt}
  7546: |-
    Present? Oh! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
    Of course you would! You never could resist my charms! <Wink, wink>
    Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7547: |-
    Yes, yes...
    Ah, here, take this.
    Thank you again.${prompt}
  7548: |-
    Oh, and...one more thing.
    Seeing or hearing things the same way isn't important. Sharing the same moments in your life is.${prompt}
  7549: |-
    Qiji told me that when he proposed to me.
    I'd like to think that's why we're still together.${prompt}
  7550: |-
    I must ask you to do something for me.
    You see, I was once a knight of San d'Oria. I left the Order and came here, to Bastok, when I realized the futility of their ways.${prompt}
  7551: |-
    On my way here, I buried my mission orders for that day near the windmills in Konschtat.
    It was a dishonorable thing to do, and I regret doing it now...${prompt}
  7552: Evi? You're not going back, are you?${prompt}
  7553: |-
    Do not worry, Rafaela, I am not.
    That paper is a testament to my past failures...
    I just wish to rip it apart with my own hands, and finally start anew.${prompt}
  7554: |-
    If you happen to go to the Konschtat Highlands, would you try retrieving it for me?
    Unfortunately, I cannot remember which windmill I buried it near...${prompt}
  7555: |-
    Yes, this is it. Finally, I may start anew.
    Take this as a token of my gratitude.
    I do not need it anymore.${prompt}
  7556: Ah, I wish I had time to chat, but I'm a little busy at the moment.${prompt}
  7557: I am the owner of this establishment, but I have yet to get used to doing all these chores...${prompt}
  7558: |-
    Yes? If there's anything you can do to help?
    Well, we're running a little low on salt, and I'm having trouble with the bookkeeping, and...${prompt}
  7559: Oh, it's no use. I've been trying to manage this restaurant ever since my husband died twenty years ago, but I still can't do anything properly...${prompt}
  7560: 'The other day, a customer ordered ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, but I haven''t been able to get any.${prompt}'
  7561: He was a regular customer when my husband ran this place, so I wish I could serve him the next time he comes in.${prompt}
  7562: |-
    Isn't this...? Yes, it is ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}! Thank you so much!
    Oh! I should pay you for your trouble...${prompt}
  7563: |-
    You were asked to help me? But who would...?
    The Chief Engineer himself?${prompt}
  7564: |-
    I see...
    Let us go upstairs--there are a few things I should tell you.${prompt}
  7565: Chief Cid was a close friend of my husband's. He was the one who gave my husband his job in the Palborough Mines. Digging mythril there earned him enough gil to open this restaurant.${prompt}
  7566: Then, twenty years ago, they discovered a new vein of mythril in the Palborough Mines, and my husband, though long retired by then, was called in to oversee the diggings.${prompt}
  7567: Things were going smoothly until...a batch of the new type of explosives they were using went off without warning, and as if waiting for such an opportunity, the Quadav attacked.${prompt}
  7568: You must have guessed by now--Chief Engineer Cid was the one who designed the formula for the new explosive.${prompt}
  7569: I would be lying if I said I never blamed Cid for my husband's death...even though my husband would surely have forgiven him.${prompt}
  7570: |-
    Give this letter to Cid for me.
    Tell him he doesn't have to worry about me, or this restaurant.${prompt}
  7571: |-
    Ah, it's you.
    That customer I told you about came back, and I was able to serve him ${item-singular: 6[2]} this time, thanks to you.${prompt}
  7572: He said he used to work with my husband in the Metalworks before he retired.${prompt}
  7573: 'He wanted to have ${item-singular: 7[2]} the next time he comes, but I don''t know where to get one...${prompt}'
  7574: |-
    Oh, my! Wherever did you find this? Thank you, you've saved me again!
    I must tell that customer to come back...${prompt}
  7575: |-
    Oh, but I forgot to ask him his name!
    He said he still worked in the Metalworks...${prompt}
  7576: |-
    He said he used to work with my husband there.
    He's a Galka, very reserved but polite.
    Do you know him?${prompt}
  7577: If you do see him, could you give him this letter of invitation for me?${prompt}
  7578: |-
    Did you give my letter to my customer?
    You did? Thank you.
    You say his name is Raibaht?${prompt}
  7579: |-
    He works in Cid's lab as the Chief Engineer's aide?
    Now that you mention it, I do remember hearing his name before...${prompt}
  7580: Oh!${prompt}
  7581: |-
    Thank you for your invitation, Ms. Hilda.
    I must apologize for my lack of manners for ordering dishes and not even leaving my name.${prompt}
  7582: Please, Mister Raibaht, come this way.${prompt}
  7583: |-
    Your husband and I were hired the same year by the Metalworks Department of Mining.
    But we were never on good terms, to say the least.${prompt}
  7584: Then why...?${prompt}
  7585: Most Humes only think of us as big brutes...but your husband was the only one to see me, a Galka, as someone worthy enough to be his rival.${prompt}
  7586: |-
    The other Humes did not even consider me capable of being a scientist.
    Your husband, though, would come to me every time he made a breakthrough...and brag.${prompt}
  7587: You may laugh, but I cannot explain how happy I was that he would come to me, and no one else.${prompt}
  7588: |-
    Yes, my husband was like that.
    He was outspoken, honest about his feelings, even childish in some ways.
    His wanting to open this restaurant, for example...${prompt}
  7589: Yes. I was dismayed at first when he decided to retire, but after seeing this place...I understand why.${prompt}
  7590: |-
    When did you decide to work for the Chief Engineer?
    I didn't think his kind of work was in your field of expertise.${prompt}
  7591: |-
    Your husband used to tell me about him.
    When I learned that it was his invention that caused your husband's demise, I decided to approach him, without revealing my true intents.${prompt}
  7592: What were you thinking of doing!?${prompt}
  7593: I wanted to see what kind of man could live with the death of so many on his conscience...but I have yet to understand him fully. He is more complex than any equation I've had to solve.${prompt}
  7594: |-
    But do not worry, madam--vengeance is long gone from my mind.
    I understand now why your husband was so fond of him.
    He and Cid are very much alike.${prompt}
  7595: Yes...I know.${prompt}
  7596: I will study Cid's work, and when I understand it fully, I will pass that knowledge down to future generations.${prompt}
  7597: |-
    That is what your husband would have wanted me to do.
    I know that now.${prompt}
  7598: |-
    These doors lead to the airship embarkation area.
    You need ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 0} gil to pass through.${prompt}

    I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Gustaberg, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}
  7607: Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Zulkheim, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}

    Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you.

    Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service!
    Have a laugh, then spend some cash!
    Treats and sweets from exotic lands!${prompt}
  7612: |-
    You guys must've worked real hard. Bastok is a much nicer place now than when I left it.
    I wish I could go back to bashing monsters again, like in the old days.${prompt}
  7613: |-
    How do you like Bastok? It's my hometown, you know!
    Sure, there are still some...unsightly elements, but it's still the best city in the world!${prompt}
  7614: The music store here sells really good instruments! Shh, don't tell the boss...but I'm gonna-wanna sneak off and go there later.${prompt}
  7615: There are plenty of bards around, but I'm the best harpist in Vana'diel. You don't believe me? Then stay awhile and listen.${prompt}
  7616: The food here's terrrible! C'mon, Windurrrstians, work harder! I miss Windurstian cuisine!${prompt}
  7617: Like to see my new knife trrrick? Good, but keep your distance if you value your various extremities and bodily protrusions!${prompt}
  7618: This place...is tiring...${prompt}
  7619: |-
    ...
    (I'm a mime.)${prompt}
  7620: Do I like airships? Are you crazy!? They're a menace!${prompt}
  7621: I hear that every time an airship passes overhead, a terrible beast appears and destroys everything!${prompt}
  7622: It's true! The monster was sighted on the Rolanberry Fields! Please...I need to convince people that airships are dangerous. I need to get my hands on whatever that monster drops--that way, I can prove it to them!${prompt}
  7623: |-
    You got it! Magnificent! But wasn't the beast horrible, as I said it would be?
    There's no time to waste. Now that I have proof, I have to warn everyone about the airship menace!!!${prompt}
  7624: Oh, and here. Take this.${prompt}
  7625: |-
    Oh, you again. What? Airships are scary? What are you talking about?
    They're the most marvelous things on earth...er, I mean, in the sky.${prompt}
  7626: |-
    Airships bring the most delicious things I've ever tasted!
    Remember the ${item-singular: 7[2]} you brought back? It was great!${prompt}
  7627: |-
    Why am I here?
    To watch those majestic airships cut through the clouds, of course!${prompt}
  7628: |-
    Take my word for it, housework is not easy.
    Especially clearing clogged chimneys--that takes up a whole day!${prompt}
  7629: Hmm... I remember my mother-in-law telling me there was an item that cleared chimneys in a flash, but what was it, I wonder? Do you know?${prompt}
  7630: |-
    Yes, can I help you?
    You have a clogged chimney? I say, adventurers really do have a lot cut out for them, what with defeating monsters, and doing housework...${prompt}
  7631: 'You need ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Put some in your chimney and light a fire, then boom! Your troubles are gone.${prompt}'
  7632: I keep telling my daughter-in-law about it, but young people these days never listen to what their elders tell them.${prompt}
  7633: |-
    Is this it? This can clear chimneys?
    My mother-in-law said so?${prompt}
  7634: |-
    Hmm...I guess I faintly remember her talking about it.
    Oh well, as long as it works.
    Here's something for your trouble.${prompt}
  7635: |-
    Ah! An adventurer! And I see you've also earned your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}!
    I need your help!${prompt}
  7636: |-
    You see, these words have been bothering me for some time:
    “Under a full moon, toward the stars of Ifrit, a bird brings a letter to the ship in the sky.”${prompt}
  7637: I don't remember where I heard it. I woke up this morning with those words...and a whopping headache...as the only clues to where I was last night.${prompt}
  7638: |-
    Could you try finding this “letter” for me? I fancy it might be a clue that leads to great treasure!
    What? Yes, of course, I will give you a share!${prompt}
  7639: |-
    “A ship that flies toward the stars of Ifrit”?
    Interesting imagery, but I've written better prose in my sleep.${prompt}
  7640: |-
    Ah! Let me see! Let me see!
    What? It's just a wishy-washy love letter.
    What's it doing on an airship?${prompt}
  7641: |-
    Here, take it back. It gives me the creeps!
    Oh, and here's something for you. Now, go away!${prompt}
  7642: |-
    My name, on some love letter? Are you sure?
    There must be some mistake.${prompt}
  7643: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]}... Yes, I am the one who wrote it.
    I have also been sending the birds, hoping she might get it.${prompt}
  7644: |-
    I met her on the shores of the Gustaberg river. She was an adventurer, as I was in those days.

  7804: |-
    What's with all the racket?
    Can't an old man have a drink in peace?
    And who are you, anyway?${prompt}
  7805: I heard about you from Degenhard in the Markets. He said that you were a master of the martial arts.${prompt}
  7806: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.
    My name is Cornelia.${prompt}
  7807: Cor...nelia?${prompt}
  7808: |-
    Yes...but not the Cornelia you know. That's why I came here.
    I would like you to tell me about her.${prompt}
  7809: |-
    Then you're wasting your time.
    I have nothing to say regarding Cornelia, a good-for-nothing student who packed up and left Bastok without even informing her master...${prompt}
  7810: |-
    I knew it!
    You were Cornelia's instructor!${prompt}
  7811: Oh, quiet down. Just because you have the same name doesn't mean you have to go romping around, acting as feisty as she was.${prompt}
  7812: |-
    So, missy, what's with your interest in the other Cornelia?
    Or, is it that you want to become one of my students?${prompt}
  7813: It's not that...${prompt}
  7814: |-
    Alright, I'll tell you one thing.
    When Cornelia said she wanted to become my pupil, I gave her this test--${prompt}
  7815: 'I told her to go deep into the Gusgen Mines and look for a tiny hole. Using ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} will call forth the vicious Wandering Ghost.${prompt}'
  7816: 'Bring back the ${item-singular: 7[2]} that the beast leaves behind--that was the test I gave her.${prompt}'
  7817: Why would you give her such a difficult...${prompt}
  7818: You there. You look like a well-polished monk. If you want any more information, go and complete that test I gave Cornelia.${prompt}
  7819: "...? \nThat can't be ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!\nThere is no way you could have...${prompt}"
  7820: What!? You say you got this after defeating a wandering ghost!?${prompt}
  7821: |-
    No... She could have lost her life in those mines...
    If she had been killed...${prompt}
  7822: The truth is, the test I gave Cornelia and you was just a joke. I never meant for anyone to actually go down there and battle any creatures.${prompt}
  7823: |-
    Think about it.
    I gave that quest to Cornelia over thirty years ago. Mining in Palborough had begun to take off, but the Gusgen Mines...${prompt}
  7824: The Gusgen Mines were still filled with hundreds of workers.${prompt}
  7825: |-
    You senile old man! I can't believe you made me do that!
    There are no ghosts in the Gusgen Mines!${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Oh! I never thought you'd actually go down into the mines!
    But what I told you was no lie.${prompt}
  7827: You're right it wasn't a lie. I met some Galka down there named “Wandering Ghost.” Was that supposed to be funny or something!?${prompt}
  7828: I never said that Wandering Ghost was an actual ghost, did I?${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Whatever!
    Here's the ${item-singular: 7[2]} you asked for, old man.${prompt}
  7830: 'What...? How were you--a simple Hume girl--able to get this ${item-singular: 7[2]} from a hard-headed Galka like Wandering Ghost...${prompt}'
  7831: Tell me about it! I would rather have taken my chances with a real wandering ghost than with that Galka! He wouldn't give me what you asked for until I brought him a hundred chunks of ore.${prompt}
  7832: I spent the last three days and three nights trapped up in that miserable mine so I could pass your test--which turns out to be a big joke. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the bargain!${prompt}
  7833: I still can't believe that you would...${prompt}
  7834: Enough! I need... I need to be stronger.${prompt}
  7835: Wandering Ghost is the name Humes gave to one of my more infamous companions.${prompt}
  7836: |-
    This ${item-singular: 7[2]} is a reminder of the time we spent together. If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it.
    Tonight, I'll drink to my lost friend. May his soul rest in peace!${prompt}
  7837: I'd like to give you something for your trouble. I think you might be able to put this to good use.${prompt}
  7838: |-
    I remember you. You're that young adventurer who came by before.
    You always bring someone along with you, don't you?${prompt}
  7839: |-
    Greetings, Master Oggbi. I see you have returned to Bastok.
    My name is Michea. Do you recall our previous meeting?${prompt}
  7840: |-
    Yes, I remember.
    You're the little girl who was always hiding behind Dalzakk. You've grown...${prompt}
  7841: I would like to inquire about Dalzakk.${prompt}
  7842: Is something wrong? Knowing him, he's probably off on some adventure again.${prompt}
  7843: |-
    That's just it. He has not returned from his latest journey...
    Gwill is worried as well, although he will not show it.${prompt}
  7844: Hmm... I remember him saying that he needed to travel to Fei'Yin on business.${prompt}
  7845: Fei'Yin? What business would he have there...?${prompt}
  7846: Well, I'm sorry to trouble you again, young adventurer, but could I ask you a favor?${prompt}
  7847: Recently I asked Dalzakk to run an errand for me. If he's still in Fei'Yin, could you find him and ask him to pass that errand on to you?${prompt}
  7848: I'm sure that Dalzakk could do it himself, but I think he should get back here as soon as possible...for Michea and Gwill's sake.${prompt}
  7849: I apologize for asking you to do so much, but if it is not a burden...${prompt}
  7850: |-
    You may think it strange coming from an old Galka like me, but it hurts me to see Michea this upset.
    Being the daughter of one of my pupils, I've always thought of her as my own granddaughter.${prompt}
  7851: |-
    Ah. So you've gone to Davoi in Dalzakk's stead, then.
    What? Why all the trouble over a simple item such as this, you ask?${prompt}
  7852: Do not worry too much of it. What is most important is that you have helped bring a little piece of happiness to a young Elvaan girl and a Galka boy.${prompt}
  7853: |-
    It looks as if you have some free time. Will you sit down and have a drink with an old man?
    No, no. I won't ask you to go off on some adventure this time, but I'll reward you for just listening to my story.${prompt}
  7854: 'It all has to do with ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  7855: One day, long ago, my pupil Cornelia and I journeyed to San d'Oria together. We were hired by the San d'Orian abbey located in Davoi.${prompt}
  7856: The Temple Knights have long been known for their skill with various weapons. However, the priests of San d'Oria, bound by their religious beliefs, spent their time refining their hand-to-hand fighting skills. One place this was practiced was in the abbey in Davoi.${prompt}
  7857: In any event, a few scrolls containing some of the abbey's knowledge of martial arts were stolen by a band of Orcs in the Jugner Forest. Our job was to get those scrolls back.${prompt}
  7858: The main reason I accepted this job was so I myself could learn of the hidden secrets of the San d'Orian monks. Nowadays, there are many who go around calling themselves monks, but few know that the currently practiced art combines Far Eastern tradition with San d'Orian techniques.${prompt}
  7859: Now, where was I... Oh yes. We headed to the Orc stronghold, or should I say, the stronghold before Davoi was taken.${prompt}
  7860: Master, are you sure we're looking in the right place?${prompt}
  7861: |-
    We're having no luck, are we?
    If this keeps on, we'll be mistaken as burgla--${prompt}
  7862: Sir...Sir Raogrimm?${prompt}
  7863: Master Oggbi. What business have you here at the Orcs' stronghold?${prompt}
  7864: We...we are just looking for...${prompt}
  7865: Hey, you can't talk to my master like that! You make him sound like a common thief!${prompt}
  7866: Oh, I see... You're that Talekeeper, Raogrimm. What's an admirable Musketeer like you doing in a dump like this?${prompt}
  7867: |-
    An amusing pupil you have, Master Oggbi.
    Normally, a Hume girl would not even know the word “Talekeeper.”${prompt}
  7868: Yeah, well, I know what I know.${prompt}
  7869: Enough, Cornelia.${prompt}
  7870: Little did he know they would soon meet again, as members of the Mythril Musketeers...${prompt}
  7871: Oh, I apologize. I've been rambling on again. Here, take this. It is the same reward I gave Cornelia when she completed her quest.${prompt}
  7872: |-

    Round and round, meow meow meow.♪${prompt}

    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  8039: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  8040: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  8041: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  8042: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  8043: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  8044: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  8045: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  8046: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8047: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8048: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}

    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  8051: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  8052: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8053: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}

    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8055: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8056: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8057: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8058: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8059: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8060: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8061: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8062: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8063: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8064: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8065: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8066: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8067: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8068: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

  8163: We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.${prompt}
  8164: Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt}
  8165: You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt}
  8166: Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt}
  8167: Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt}
  8168: Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt}
  8169: Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt}
  8170: Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt}
  8171: 'Your inventory is full. You could not accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8172: You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.${prompt}
  8173: I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, ${name-npc}. My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.${prompt}

  8365: I see you're working hard.${prompt}
  8366: Ch...Chief Cid!${prompt}
  8367: |-
    Oh, you don't have to go and be all formal.
    Have there been any changes around here?${prompt}
  8368: |-
    No sir!
    There has been an increase in the number of adventurers using the airship, as well as an all-around increase in exports, but no signs of any disturbances.${prompt}
  8369: Truly, Chief Cid's wonderful innovations have brought wealth and prosperity to the Port Distr--${prompt}
  8370: |-
    Enough with the flattery!
    That airship was just one invention, like many others.${prompt}
  8371: What we need to worry about is the unrest in the Mines District. I'm concerned that the trouble down there is going to spill over into Port Bastok.${prompt}
  8372: The escalation in activity around Norg also troubles me. Soon there will be airships going to the Outlands. Who knows what those adventurers will be up to when that starts?${prompt}
  8373: Ah, and what about the Steaming Sheep Restaurant? That old place still doing fine? I mean...it's making money, right? There aren't any strange guys hanging around the proprietor...are there?${prompt}
  8374: |-
    Sir?
    I stop in every day after my duties are complete, and business seems decent as usual...${prompt}
  8375: |-
    Good...good.
    Forget what I said.${prompt}
  8376: I wonder what's wrong with Chief Cid.${prompt}
  8377: |-
    You mean you haven't heard?
    Cid's got the hots for the lady at the tavern.
    Word has it that she's a widow...${prompt}
  8378: Wow. Maybe Chief Cid's got a soft spot after all.${prompt}
  8379: |-
    Welcome back.
    How are the adventurers faring?${prompt}
  8380: |-
    Lady Ayame!
    What brings you to this area?${prompt}
  8381: |-
    I was just on my way to another appointment and decided to stop by.
    What is the status of Port Bastok? Is everything all right?${prompt}
  8382: |-
    Chief Cid asked us the same question earlier...
    But there is nothing out of the ordinary, and Port Bastok is safe as long as we are here, Lady Ayame!${prompt}
  8383: |-
    Very well.
    The one thing that concerns me, though, is the recent activity of the Tenshodo.
    Now that the airship will be making trips to the Outlands, I feel that they may team up with the pirates in Norg for another one of their get-rich-quick schemes.${prompt}
  8384: |-
    I have heard that Milady conducted her training in Norg.
    I am grateful for this important piece of information. I will reinforce the number of guards I have patrolling the area.${prompt}
  8385: Understood. Carry on.${prompt}
  8386: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Surely there isn't another woman as beautiful as Lady Ayame. In the desert of Musketeers, she's a garden of roses.
    But I wonder why she was all the way out here.${prompt}
  8387: |-
    You didn't know?
    Lady Ayame grew up here in Port Bastok.
    Right over there.${prompt}
  8388: Wow... I bet her whole family is as beautiful and valiant as she is.${prompt}
  8389: Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, “sell these beans,” so like, here I am. Are you gonna buy some beans, dude?
  8390: Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, “sell these fireworks,” so like, here I am. But like, don't go using those things around my hair, dude.
  8391: |-
    Today, festival day!
    You must buy. You buy now.
  8392: |-
    Welcome to my humble establishment.
    I have a wide variety of specialty goods from Kuzotz.${prompt}
  8393: Hey therrre! I've got lots of wonderrrful goodies, fresh from the Elshimo Lowlands.${prompt}
  8394: I'm trrrying to start a business selling goods from the Elshimo Lowlands, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan contrrrol.${prompt}
  8395: |-
    Welcome! Welcome!
    Take a wonderrr at these specialty goods from the Elshimo Uplands!${prompt}
  8396: I'm trrrying to start a business selling goods from the Elshimo Uplands, but it's not easy transporting goods from areas that aren't under Bastokan contrrrol.${prompt}
  8397: Hey. Have you heard of my sister Ayame? She's a samurai and a member of the Mythril Musketeers. She's so cool. Me? I'm nothing compared to her...${prompt}
  8398: But I was thinking. If I could use a katana, too, I could be cool and strong like her.${prompt}
  8399: But when I asked my dad about it, he got mad and said I couldn't.${prompt}
  8400: My dad's been acting strange lately. I think that he's been visiting that Kagetora from the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8401: Kaede? What are you up to now? You know you shouldn't be bothering our visitors.${prompt}
  8402: I just know he's hiding something!${prompt}
  8403: What do you want? You want to know about Ensetsu?${prompt}
  8404: Can't even hide something from his kid. Ha! That would explain why he never was called for battle.${prompt}
  8405: If you want to know why that old man is coming here, you ask him yourself. He's obviously having money problems. Maybe you can help him out.${prompt}
  8406: How do I know Ensetsu? I guess you could ask the lady we both loved for that answer. Ha ha ha!${prompt}
  8407: Kagetora told you that? What was he thinking? He usually isn't the type to go telling other people's secrets...${prompt}
  8408: Secrets? What secrets? I knew you were hiding something, Father!${prompt}
  8409: I'm not hiding anything! Children should keep their noses out of their parents' business!${prompt}
  8410: Stop treating me like I'm a child! You were never like this with Ayame! I know I can learn to use a katana and be cool, just like her!${prompt}
  8411: Kaede...${prompt}
  8412: Father, you are buying your katana from Mr. Kagetora, aren't you? You can use one, can't you?${prompt}
  8413: Ayame says she went on a journey to learn the ways of the blade, but I bet it was you who taught her!${prompt}
  8414: What are you talking about...?${prompt}
  8415: I hate you! Why won't you tell me the truth!?${prompt}
  8416: I'm sorry that you had to see that... Girls these days grow up so fast. What is a father to do?${prompt}
  8417: One day, I know I'll have to tell her the truth about...${prompt}
  8418: Excuse me. I know that you must be busy, but could I ask a favor of you?${prompt}
  8419: I would like to buy something back that I recently sold through the Tenshodo. However, I was told by Kagetora that it has already been shipped to Norg.${prompt}
  8420: 'He told me that if I bring him ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} from the Korroloka Tunnel, he would return my item.${prompt}'
  8421: However, there is no way that I would survive a trip to that tunnel... I would be in your debt if you could travel there in my place.${prompt}
  8422: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]}! I am grateful for your help...but there is one problem.${prompt}'
  8423: Kagetora told me that if I wanted my item back, I would need to go to Norg and get it myself.${prompt}
  8424: As much as I would like to go, I cannot.${prompt}
  8425: 'I hate to ask you again after all the trouble you have gone through, but would it be too much to ask you to take that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} to Ryoma in Norg? I would be in your debt...${prompt}'
  8426: I appreciate all that you have done for me, and apologize for having you travel to Norg in my place.${prompt}
  8427: The item Ensetsu sold here? Yeah, that's already on its way to Norg. Once I've collected my cut, I have no reason to help anybody.${prompt}
  8428: I cannot express in words the gratitude I feel towards your kindness. I sold this to help support my family, but then I realized that my daughter needed it once more.${prompt}
  8429: |-
    Father!
    What is that? You bought another sword for Ayame, didn't you? It's just not fair!${prompt}
  8430: Would you stop going on about that! I have never purchased a weapon for your sister. Every katana she owns was acquired without my, or anyone else's, help.${prompt}
  8431: Then what is that for?${prompt}
  8432: I was going to wait, but I guess you are old enough to know...${prompt}
  8433: This dagger was your mother's...${prompt}
  8434: You mean this old thing was...${prompt}
  8435: Mom's...?${prompt}
  8436: Yes. Its real name is a shinobi gatana.${prompt}
  8437: Mom was a ninja?${prompt}
  8438: Long ago, Yomi...your mother and I lived in Norg. Norg is a haven for the arts of the Far East.${prompt}
  8439: I was just a lowly crew member on a pirate ship. Your mother, on the other hand, was a master of ninjutsu--almost as strong as she was beautiful...${prompt}
  8440: And that's probably why she found comfort in a normal, boring man like me.${prompt}
  8441: When we found that your mother was carrying your sister, we left Norg and traveled here in search of a more simple life.${prompt}
  8442: 'It was at that time that your mother told me this: she was proud of the road she had taken, and it was that very road that led her to her new life.${prompt}'
  8443: The hardships that she had to endure made her into the strong mother that she was.${prompt}
  8444: Perhaps at that time, she realized that she did not have much longer in this world...${prompt}
  8445: But she fought for ten long years until she exchanged her life for the life of our second daughter...you, Kaede.${prompt}
  8446: B-but...${prompt}
  8447: I never wanted you or your sister to take up the katana.${prompt}
  8448: When your sister said she wanted to travel to Norg to study the way of the samurai, of course I was against it. However, if it was to keep her from becoming a ninja...${prompt}
  8449: Kaede... Each day, you remind me more and more of your mother.${prompt}
  8450: I remind you of...Mom?${prompt}
  8451: And that's why I have been so protective of you. But maybe I was wrong...${prompt}
  8452: Unlike most fighters, ninjas do not just wave their swords. They lurk in the shadows and stalk their enemies. One must have the highest level of patience and concentration to draw that blade.${prompt}
  8453: Your mother left this blade sheathed to remind her of that, and now this blade will be passed on to you.${prompt}
  8454: The road you travel is for you to decide, but do not forget the message that remains in your mother's katana.${prompt}
  8455: Mom!${prompt}
  8456: I thank you so much for your help in bringing the blade back to my home. I do not have much to offer you, but take this scroll detailing the secrets of the ninja as a token of my appreciation. It was my wife's.${prompt}
  8457: No, Kaede won't be needing it. All she really needed was her mother's strong will and spirit. If she wishes to walk the path Yomi chose, it will be her decision.${prompt}
  8458: But I have the feeling she will be traveling to Norg soon...to find that path.${prompt}
  8459: You can now become a ninja.${prompt}
  8460: Ah, ${name-player}. Thank you again for all you have done for my daughter and me.${prompt}
  8461: I'm going to take good care of my mom's katana. I, too, will learn to be strong like her.${prompt}
  8462: I remember my sister talking about how the strongest warriors are the ones who draw their blades the least. I think I know what she was talking about now...${prompt}
  8463: A Mister Hani? Now that you mention it, I do remember an adventurer going by that name... He was talking about a letter he received from some Galka.${prompt}
  8464: However, he seemed more interested in his next quest than that letter. He kept asking if I knew anything about the Palborough Mines.${prompt}
  8465: My late husband knew much of those mines. When I told him the stories my husband had told me, the adventurer got excited and said he was setting off for the Mines the next day.${prompt}
  8466: And that was the last I heard of him. I hope nothing terrible has happened to him...${prompt}
  8467: What do you mean, Ryoma sent you? He wants to know about that old scroll we found nearly two decades ago?${prompt}
  8468: Why me? Ryoma knows I don't want to deal with that guy anymore...${prompt}
  8469: Oh well... Listen up. It all started twenty years ago...${prompt}
  8470: This is what you were looking for, right? Just where the ancient writings said it would be.${prompt}
  8471: Damn, you're good, Yomi. How did you...${prompt}
  8472: A ninja wouldn't be any good if she went around telling everyone her secrets now, would she?${prompt}
  8473: |-
    Ha-ha. True.
    Now, let me get you up to speed on your next job.${prompt}
  8474: Have you forgotten already, Kagetora? I told you before I left that this was going to be my last mission.${prompt}
  8475: But you were kidding, right? You can't leave us now.${prompt}
  8476: No, I was not kidding. If you have any problems with my decision, you can take them up with Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  8477: Hey! What the hell are you doing here!?${prompt}
  8478: To think that a weasel like that would end up with the hand of the most beautiful woman to ever set foot in Norg... Oh, sorry about that. I got side-tracked.${prompt}
  8479: Anyway, that scroll Ryoma wants to decipher is the same one that Yomi used on her final job for Norg.${prompt}
  8480: All information on it was lost after Yomi and that insect of a husband of hers moved here.${prompt}
  8481: If you want to know any more, try asking Ensetsu. Rough him up a little, and the wimp is sure to spill his guts.${prompt}
  8482: Ah, ${name-player}. Thank you again for all you have done for my fami...${prompt}
  8483: What? My wife's final job?${prompt}
  8484: I can tell you what I know...though it is not much.${prompt}
  8485: Our investigation into the contents of that ancient scroll took us to the Altepa Desert region of Zepwell Island. There, Yomi succeeded in deciphering it.${prompt}
  8486: 'Just a simple ship hand, I remained on the boat during the investigation, though I did happen to get a glimpse of the deciphered scroll. The following words were written: “Search out the point in the desert where rations lie stacked one upon another.”${prompt}'
  8487: 'However, Yomi already traveled to that area and took ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} that she had found there back to Norg. If you journeyed to that place now, I do not know if you would find anything.${prompt}'
  8488: 'Yes, this resembles the same ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} that Yomi brought back from Altepa many years ago. But it looks fairly new... What do you think this could mean?${prompt}'
  8489: 'You want to know more about the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}? Well, I am sorry, but I have told you all I know.${prompt}'
  8490: The information that Yomi came across on that mission was from Mitsunari's grandson.${prompt}
  8491: Mitsunari left the ancient scroll to his grandson. It was this grandson who helped Yomi decipher it.${prompt}
  8492: What? You too were attacked by poisonous spiders at the location shown in that scroll--the same location my Yomi was attacked?${prompt}
  8493: |-
    It was a trap...
    Mitsunari had much knowledge in the area of poisons. Only he could devise such a plan...${prompt}
  8494: Mitsunari's grandson used to live in a tent somewhere in the Altepa Desert. You could try looking for him, but where he resides now, I do not know.${prompt}
  8495: There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.${prompt}
  8496: It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.${prompt}
  8497: Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.${prompt}
  8498: I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.${prompt}
  8499: Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.${prompt}
  8500: That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.${prompt}
  8501: Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.${prompt}

  8508: As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  8509: You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.${prompt}

  8513: Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.${prompt}
  8514: According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.${prompt}

    Oh good, you made it back in one piece.
    I'm sorry about before, I was completely-vetely caught up with chasing down Uran-Mafran.${prompt}

    Yes.
    No.${prompt}

  8607: |-
    But it didn't work properly?
    Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt}
  8608: |-
    ...Oh dear Goddess...
    Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt}
  8609: When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt}
  8610: Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt}
  8611: |-
    Please take this.
    North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?${prompt}

    ...We m-m-meet again...
    ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt}

  8624: 'What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  8625: Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.${prompt}
  8626: |-
    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  8627: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  8628: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  8629: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  8630: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  8631: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  8632: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  8633: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  8634: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  8635: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt}
  8636: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  8637: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  8638: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  8639: |-
    ...
    Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  8640: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  8641: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  8642: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  8643: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  8644: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  8645: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you''re ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8646: 'The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt}'
  8647: |-
    I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.
    Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt}
  8648: 'Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt}'
  8649: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt}
  8650: |-
    Are you sure you are ready?

  8672: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt}

    What?
    If you have something to say, say it.${prompt}

  8710: I have been partied up with her for the past few months, and to tell you the truth, they have been some of the best months I've experienced since becoming an adventurer.${prompt}
  8711: Have you ever seen her wield a sword? She's as beautiful and as graceful as a butterfly fluttering through the wilds.${prompt}
  8712: However, I find myself not only attracted to Dariah the fighter, but also Dariah the adventurer... Dariah the woman...${prompt}
  8713: '...${prompt}'
  8714: Ah, but enough with the small talk.${prompt}
  8715: Let me inform you of the true reason why I came to you today.${prompt}
  8716: Dariah has fallen gravely ill.${prompt}
  8717: She has what!?${prompt}
  8718: No. I don't know if the word “ill” is the proper word to describe her condition.${prompt}
  8719: While on an excursion to Norvallen, Dariah and I came across a beautiful flower that glittered softly like a diamond. However, when Dariah placed her hands upon it, she suddenly collapsed.${prompt}
  8720: She is still breathing, but will not wake up from her cursed slumber. When I inquired about her condition with one of the elder Elvaan, he called her condition the dreaded “sommeil de morte.”${prompt}
  8721: We tried everything from medicines to magic to revive her, but our efforts were futile.${prompt}
  8722: However, according to the elders, there is still one hope. An ancient melody that is said to wake anyone--the “Chanson de Liberte.”${prompt}
  8723: Using the “Chanson de Liberte” may be the only way to bring Dariah back to us.${prompt}
  8724: I have heard the tale of a great bard who wrote such a song...${prompt}
  8725: He composed the miraculous melody to help him bring back a lost love...${prompt}
  8726: They say that the ancients even used it to revive their deceased king.${prompt}
  8727: But to think that the lost tune is the only way to save dear Dariah...${prompt}
  8728: It is the only way. We must help her.${prompt}
  8729: However, to complete the song, we must first gather its pages.${prompt}
  8730: I would do the task myself, but I am afraid that without my party, I would be unable to retrieve the necessary items.${prompt}
  8731: |-
    I see...
    We must think of a way to collect all the pages of the “Chanson de Liberte” before it is too late.${prompt}
  8732: Exactly.${prompt}
  8733: But once we have all the pages, who will do the translation of the lyrics? I know of no one who can read the ancient language.${prompt}
  8734: |-
    Yes, translation...
    And a new arrangement of the melody will also be needed.${prompt}
  8735: |-
    That is correct. You know much of this song.
    However, there are not many people who could complete the task of translation and arrangement.${prompt}
  8736: Please, sir. Do not mock me. While I may not be famous, I am a professional bard.${prompt}
  8737: Oh, so you think that you can translate the ancient language in the “Chanson de Liberte”?${prompt}
  8738: Are you sure that you can handle it?${prompt}
  8739: |-
    Of course!
    If Dariah is in need of my help, I will do anything in my power to assist her!${prompt}
  8740: I sense confidence in your words, but will you be able to live up to them?${prompt}
  8741: We shall see if you can truly do what you say, or if your words are just merely words.${prompt}
  8742: Merely...words...${prompt}
  8743: Merely words!? You just watch! I will save Dariah.${prompt}
  8744: I regret to ask this of you, ${name-player}, but would you assist me in my quest to save a life?${prompt}
  8745: According to legend, the “Chanson de Liberte” works by calling upon the ancient gods for their help.${prompt}
  8746: 'The three pages necessary to complete the song--the ${keyitem-singular: 5[2]}, the ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]}, and the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}--are located deep within dungeons spread out across Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8747: As I explained earlier, to save Dariah, we must gather these three pages and have them translated.${prompt}
  8748: From the information I have collected, I know that one of the pages lies somewhere within a castle in the cursed Northlands.${prompt}
  8749: I, too, have heard of the location of the three pages.${prompt}
  8750: One is said to be hidden in an undersea cave near the Yuhtunga Jungle, while yet another lies buried somewhere in a labyrinth on an eastern peninsula.${prompt}
  8751: I will deal with the translation, but I need someone to help me get the three pages...${prompt}
  8752: It is not an easy task, but I feel your just heart will guide you on your journey.${prompt}
  8753: You've returned with the three pages! I do not know...I do not know what to say!${prompt}
  8754: I will begin on the translation right away. Dariah's life is on the line... There is not a second to lose.${prompt}
  8755: I apologize, but the translation will require more time.${prompt}
  8756: |-
    Hold on, Dariah...
    I swear on my life that I will save yours.${prompt}
  8757: |-
    ${name-player}! I have succeeded in translating the “Chanson de Liberte”!
    We must hurry and get this song to Dariah.${prompt}
  8758: Oh, you're here...${prompt}
  8759: I did as I said I would. The translation and arrangement are complete.${prompt}
  8760: I see...${prompt}
  8761: There is something that I have to tell you...${prompt}
  8762: Wh-what!?${prompt}
  8763: |-
    I apologize...
    Everything I have told you about Dariah...${prompt}
  8764: They have all been lies.${prompt}
  8765: '!?${prompt}'
  8766: It is true that our party traveled to Norvallen. However, the story about the flower and Dariah's ailment...none of it was true.${prompt}
  8767: Why would you do...${prompt}
  8768: |-
    From the moment I laid my eyes upon her, I was put under a spell.
    Her smile... Her frown... Her strengths... Her weaknesses... I came to love them all.${prompt}
  8769: However, as much as my love for her grew, she would not answer that love.${prompt}
  8770: She would... She would often talk of you, Carmelo.${prompt}
  8771: Kind, intelligent...strong...${prompt}
  8772: And so I decided...to test you.${prompt}
  8773: Test me?${prompt}
  8774: I apologize for my wrongdoing.${prompt}
  8775: I just wanted to see your sincerity towards Dariah. I wanted to see if you loved her as much as she loved you...${prompt}
  8776: '...!${prompt}'
  8777: Here, take this. It is not much, but it is the only thing I can do to say that I am sorry...${prompt}
  8778: Wait. I...${prompt}
  8779: I underestimated you, Carmelo...${prompt}
  8780: Take care of yourself...and Dariah.${prompt}
  8781: Then...what did we have to get the “Chanson de Liberte” for!?${prompt}
  8782: And what did he mean, “Take care of Dariah”!?${prompt}
  8783: Dariah and I are no longer...${prompt}
  8784: Well, no matter. As long as she is safe...${prompt}
  8785: I apologize for all the trouble that I have caused you. Please take this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt}
  8786: I am forever in your debt for what you have done for me. However, I have one last request...${prompt}
  8787: Someday, this song will be needed to save the life of a loved one. But until that day...${prompt}
  8788: I would like you to take this deep into the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.${prompt}
  8789: Somewhere in that primordial forest is a beautiful place where clear spring water bubbles up around a ring of white-flowered trees.${prompt}
  8790: When the sanctuary is bathed in the hues of dusk, bury the pages of the song in that place. There it will wait for another to come along...${prompt}
  8791: |-

  8904: He lusts after glory, even more so than skill and technique. Always wanting to serve under a person of prominence. When he heard that Ayame had become a Mythril Musketeer, he threw his training away and left Norg behind.${prompt}

  8908: Both parents were exceptional samurai. However, they led a spartan lifestyle and cared little for material wealth.${prompt}
  8909: I guess that was more than Viresefilant could take. He chose the path of a mercenary ninja and a life in the shadows.${prompt}
  8910: He decided against the way of the samurai and the lifestyle of his parents. And now Ayame, a samurai herself, has become a Mythril Musketeer. Ironically, Viresefilant's decision to train as a ninja ruined his chances to improve his station in life.${prompt}

  8961: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8962: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8963: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8964: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8965: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8966: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8967: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8968: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8969: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8970: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8971: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8972: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8973: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8974: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8975: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8976: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8977: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8978: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8979: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8980: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8981: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8982: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8983: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8984: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8985: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8986: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8987: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8988: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  8990: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  8991: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  8992: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8993: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  8994: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  8995: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  8996: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  8997: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  8998: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  8999: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  9000: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  9001: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  9002: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  9003: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  9004: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  9005: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  9006: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  9007: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  9008: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  9009: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  9010: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  9011: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  9012: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  9013: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  9014: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  9015: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  9016: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  9017: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  9018: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}

    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  9593: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  9594: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  9595: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}

  9632: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  9633: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  9634: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  9635: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}

    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}

  10020: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  10021: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  10022: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  10023: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  10024: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  10025: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  10026: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}

    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10030: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  10031: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  10032: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  10033: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  10034: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  10035: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  10036: Good luck.${prompt}
  10037: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?

  10055: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  10056: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  10057: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  10058: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  10059: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  10060: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  10061: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  10062: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  10063: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  10064: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  10065: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10066: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  10067: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  10068: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  10069: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  10070: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  10071: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  10072: Good luck!${prompt}
  10073: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  10074: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  10075: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  10076: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  10077: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  10078: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  10079: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  10080: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  10081: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10082: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  10083: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  10084: What do you think?${prompt}
  10085: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  10086: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  10087: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  10088: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  10089: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  10090: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  10091: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  10092: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  10093: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  10094: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  10095: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  10096: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  10097: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  10098: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  10099: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  10100: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10101: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  10102: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  10103: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  10104: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  10105: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  10106: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  10107: Good luck!${prompt}
  10108: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  10109: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  10110: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  10111: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  10112: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  10113: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  10114: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  10115: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  10116: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  10117: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  10118: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  10119: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  10120: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.
    Please be careful...${prompt}
  10121: |-
    You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.
    Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt}
  10122: |-
    I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.
    Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt}
  10123: I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt}
  10124: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  10125: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  10126: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  10127: |-

    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  10128: So pretty...the fountain is still so...${prompt}
  10129: |-
    That must be...the chateau...
    And over there...the cathedral...${prompt}
  10130: I never thought...to return here...${prompt}
  10131: |-
    Every morning...I watched him training...from afar...
    If only...I had had the courage...${prompt}
  10132: |-
    No...he was a Hume...
    I...am a witch...
    If I were...to confess...${prompt}
  10133: |-
    And then...there was the lunch...he always carried...
    Someone...must have made it...for him...${prompt}
  10134: |-
    He passed...without ever knowing...
    But I...am still here...${prompt}
  10135: |-
    I...
    I should no longer care...
    I want to forget...${prompt}
  10136: |-
    The fountain where he took his rest...
    The stones that grew wet with his tears...
    Nothing has changed...except me...${prompt}
  10137: |-
    The moat where he swam...
    The shade where he slept...
    It is still the same...${prompt}
  10138: |-
    Ah...I know you are there...
    But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...${prompt}
  10139: This moat...where I fell in...${prompt}
  10140: |-
    I slipped...on the bridge...
    I fell...${prompt}
  10141: |-
    He was always there...
    I didn't notice...${prompt}
  10142: |-
    From the time that I was small...
    Always there to save me...${prompt}
  10143: |-
    Even when I was loathed and feared...
    You were there to praise my power...${prompt}
  10144: My brother...${prompt}
  10145: |-
    But I...I was always angry...
    I even forgot the lunch you made...${prompt}
  10146: |-
    But here...
    I want to tell you just once...${prompt}
  10147: |-
    Thank you...
    Thank you for being there...for me...${prompt}
  10148: Your lunches...always made with so much care...${prompt}
  10149: |-
    I see you there...
    Listening to me... I should curse you...
    But I will forgive you...as my brother would...${prompt}
  10150: |-
    These trees...
    I burned with the Fire spell...
    Yet they have grown back...${prompt}
  10151: |-
    This stream...
    I froze with Blizzaga II...
    Yet now it flows...${prompt}
  10152: |-
    This building...
    I toppled with Aeroga III...
    Yet it has been rebuilt...${prompt}
  10153: |-
    The wall of the Metalworks...
    I cracked with Thunder IV...
    Yet it has been repaired...${prompt}
  10154: |-
    It is as if...I never existed...
    Have my sins...also been erased...?${prompt}
  10155: |-
    My magic...has always been overpowerful...
    The cold stares...of the townspeople...${prompt}
  10156: |-
    I learned my spells...for vengeance...
    People called me...heartless...${prompt}
  10157: I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...${prompt}
  10158: |-
    Then why...?
    Why do I feel so at home here...?${prompt}
  10159: |-
    Why...?
    Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?${prompt}
  10160: |-
    You...I see you...
    Cease your stalking...
    I wish to be alone...${prompt}
  10161: A genius...is never understood...by the masses...${prompt}
  10162: A genius...is isolated...from the common people...${prompt}
  10163: A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...${prompt}
  10164: |-
    I wanted to save her...
    The girl with astounding talent...${prompt}
  10165: To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...${prompt}
  10166: |-
    The Dark Lilies...
    A coven of...chosen...
    A sanctuary...for witches...${prompt}
  10167: |-
    Yet...I wonder...
    Was it all...for the best...?
    To leave...this world behind...?${prompt}
  10168: |-
    Was she...truly happy...?
    Being enveloped...in the darkness...?${prompt}
  10169: |-
    I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time...
    In this town...the town I had forsaken...${prompt}
  10170: |-
    I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found...
    In this town...that I once loved...${prompt}
  10171: |-
    You...go back...
    Back to the exorcist...
    Tell him...I am ready...to leave...${prompt}
  10172: This...was a secret place...${prompt}
  10173: A place...that nobody knew...${prompt}
  10174: The perrrfect spot...${prompt}
  10175: |-
    An enchanted spot...
    So many fish...
    They would just jump...onto the hook...${prompt}

    I would fish...and fish...and fish...
    We were poor...I had no other choice...${prompt}

    But I hated...being poor...

  10447: They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}

  10449: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt}
  10450: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt}
  10451: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt}

  10454: “Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt}
  10455: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10456: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  10457: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10458: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10459: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10460: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10461: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10462: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10463: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10464: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10465: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  10466: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  10467: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  10470: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  10471: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  10472: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10473: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10474: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10475: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10476: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10477: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10478: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10479: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10480: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10481: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10482: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10483: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  10484: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10485: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10486: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10487: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10488: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10489: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10490: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10491: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10492: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10493: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10494: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  10495: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10496: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10497: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10498: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  10499: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10500: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

    Competing.
    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10503: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10504: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  10505: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  10506: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  10507: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10508: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  10509: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  10510: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  10511: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  10512: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10513: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  10514: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  10515: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  10516: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10518: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10519: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10520: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10521: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10522: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10523: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10524: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  10527: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10528: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10529: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  10530: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'

  10533: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10534: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10535: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  10536: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  10537: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10538: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10539: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10540: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10541: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10542: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10543: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10546: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10547: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10548: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10549: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10550: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10551: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10552: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10553: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10554: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10555: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  10556: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10557: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10558: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  10559: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  10560: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  10561: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10562: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  10563: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10564: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10565: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

  11700: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  11701: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  11702: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  11703: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  11704: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  11705: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  11706: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  11707: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  11708: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  11709: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  11710: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  11711: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  11712: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  11713: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  11714: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11715: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  11716: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  11717: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  11718: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  11719: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  11720: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  11721: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  11722: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  11723: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  11724: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11725: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  11726: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  11727: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  11728: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  11729: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  11730: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'
  11731: Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
  11732: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'

  11994: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  11995: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}

  11997: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  11998: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  12009: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12010: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12011: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12012: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12013: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12014: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12015: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12016: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12017: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12018: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12019: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12020: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12021: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12022: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12023: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12024: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12025: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12026: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12027: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12028: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12029: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12030: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12031: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12032: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12033: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12034: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12035: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12036: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  12037: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12039: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12040: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12041: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12042: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12043: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12044: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12045: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12046: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12047: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12048: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12049: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12050: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12051: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12052: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12053: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12054: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12055: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12056: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12057: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12059: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12060: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12061: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12062: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12063: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12064: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12065: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12066: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12067: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12068: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12069: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12070: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12071: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12072: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12073: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12074: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12075: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12076: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12077: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12078: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12079: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12080: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  12081: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  12144: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  12145: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  12146: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  12147: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12148: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12149: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12150: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12151: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12152: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12153: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12154: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12155: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12156: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12157: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12158: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12159: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12160: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12161: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12162: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12163: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12164: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12165: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  12166: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  12167: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12168: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12169: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12170: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12171: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12172: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12173: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12174: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12175: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12176: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12177: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12178: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  12249: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12250: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12251: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12252: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12253: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12254: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12255: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12256: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  12257: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  12258: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  12259: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  12260: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  12261: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  12262: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  12263: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  12264: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  12265: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  12266: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12267: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12268: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12269: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12270: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12271: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12272: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12273: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  12274: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  12275: Good day, fol--
  12276: ピヨ！
  12277: 'Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana''diel. '
  12278: And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!

    #${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]}
  12280: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
  12281: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12282: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12283: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12284: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12285: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12286: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12287: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12288: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12289: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12290: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12291: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12292: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12293: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12294: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12295: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12296: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12297: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12298: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12299: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12300: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12301: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12302: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12303: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12304: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12305: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12306: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12307: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12308: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12309: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  12310: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  12311: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  12312: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  12313: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  12314: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12315: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  12316: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  12317: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  12318: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  12319: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  12320: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  12321: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  12322: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  12323: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  12324: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12325: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12326: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12327: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12328: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12329: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12330: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12331: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12332: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12333: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12334: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12335: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12336: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12337: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12338: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12339: And they're off!
  12340: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12341: Well, I fel--
  12342: ピヨピヨッ！
  12343: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12344: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12345: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12346: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12347: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  12348: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12349: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12350: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12351: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12352: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12353: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12354: ピヨピヨ！
  12355: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12356: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12357: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12358: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12359: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12360: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12361: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12362: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  12363: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12364: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12365: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  12366: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  12367: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12368: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12369: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  12370: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12371: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  12372: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12373: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12374: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12375: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  12376: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12377: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12378: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  12379: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12380: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  12381: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  12382: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  12383: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  12384: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  12385: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  12386: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  12387: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  12388: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  12389: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  12390: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  12391: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  12392: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  12393: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  12394: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  12395: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  12396: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  12397: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  12398: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  12399: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  12400: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  12401: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  12402: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  12403: Until next time, race fans...
  12404: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  12405: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12406: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  12407: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12408: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12409: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  12410: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  12411: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  12412: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  12428: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}

    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}

    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  12431: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  12432: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  12433: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  12434: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  12435: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  12436: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  12437: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  12438: But...?${prompt}
  12439: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12440: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  12441: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  12442: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  12443: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  12444: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  12445: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  12446: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  12447: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  12448: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  12449: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  12450: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  12451: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}

    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  12453: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  12454: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  12455: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  12456: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  12457: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  12458: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  12459: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  12460: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  12461: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  12462: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12463: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  12464: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  12465: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  12466: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  12467: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  12468: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  12469: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  12470: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  12471: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  12472: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  12473: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  12474: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  12475: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  12476: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  12477: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  12478: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  12479: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  12480: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  12481: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  12482: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  12483: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  12484: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  12485: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  12486: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  12487: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  12488: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  12489: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  12490: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  12491: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  12492: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  12493: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  12494: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  12495: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  12496: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  12497: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  12498: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  12499: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  12500: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  12501: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  12502: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  12503: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  12504: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  12505: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  12506: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12507: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12508: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  12509: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  12510: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  12511: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  12512: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  12513: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  12514: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  12515: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12516: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12517: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  12518: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  12519: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  12520: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  12521: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  12522: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12523: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  12524: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12525: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  12526: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  12527: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  12528: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  12529: '...${prompt}'
  12530: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  12531: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  12532: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  12533: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  12534: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  12535: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  12536: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  12537: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  12538: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  12539: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  12540: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  12541: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  12542: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  12543: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  12544: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  12545: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  12546: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  12547: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  12548: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  12549: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  12550: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  12551: '...${prompt}'
  12552: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  12553: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  12554: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  12555: What's more...${prompt}
  12556: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  12557: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12558: What...?${prompt}
  12559: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  12560: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  12561: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  12562: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  12563: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  12564: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12565: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  12566: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  12567: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  12568: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  12569: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  12570: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  12571: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  12572: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12573: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12574: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  12575: And they're off!
  12576: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  12577: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  12578: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  12579: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12580: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12581: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12582: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12583: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  12584: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12585: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12586: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  12587: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12588: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  12589: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12590: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12591: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12592: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12593: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  12594: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  12595: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  12596: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  12597: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  12598: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  12599: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  12600: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  12601: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  12602: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  12603: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  12604: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  12605: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  12606: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  12607: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  12608: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  12609: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  12610: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  12611: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  12612: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  12613: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  12614: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  12615: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  12616: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  12617: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  12618: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  12619: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  12620: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  12621: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  12622: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  12623: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  12624: |-

    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}

    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”

    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12950: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12951: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12952: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12953: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12954: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12955: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12956: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12957: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12958: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12959: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12960: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12961: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12962: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12963: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12964: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12965: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12966: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12967: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12968: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12969: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12970: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12971: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12972: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12973: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12974: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12975: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12976: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12977: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12978: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12979: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12980: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12981: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12982: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12983: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12984: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12985: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12986: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12987: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12988: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12989: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12990: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12991: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12992: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12993: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12994: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12995: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12996: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12997: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12998: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12999: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  13000: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  13001: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  13002: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  13003: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  13004: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  13005: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  13006: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  13007: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  13008: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  13009: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  13010: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13011: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  13012: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  13013: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  13014: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  13015: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  13016: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  13017: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  13018: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  13019: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  13020: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  13021: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  13022: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  13023: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  13024: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13025: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

  13049: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  13050: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  13051: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}

    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  13123: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  13124: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  13125: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  13126: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  13127: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  13128: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  13129: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  13130: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  13131: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}

  13359: At least, I suppose so. They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there should be nothing nagging at my noggin after all...${prompt}
  13360: Let me tell you a troubled tale. Not long ago, some grisly green gobs came to Vana'diel, and we amassed a fabulous fortune crafting countless curios in their likeness.${prompt}
  13361: But there was an--inconsequential?--issue with them consuming crystals like crunchy candies.${prompt}
  13362: Thanks to hardy heroes and moogle magic, we turned them into cerulean stone shards and sent them scurrying home, kupo.${prompt}
  13363: But we gave the victors great gifts resembling those rowdy ruffians, so our profits plummeted and we had to cancel our tropical travel plans...${prompt}
  13364: But the past is in the past. We must make the most of the moment!${prompt}
  13365: And so! With the multicolored monsters now manifesting themselves, we found our next best chance!${prompt}
  13366: They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there's nothing to knock my noggin over...${prompt}

  13377: Undeniably unimportant. What matters most is the moment!${prompt}
  13378: Oh ho? A covert communique from my cohort in charge of the stone shard storage.${prompt}
  13379: Yes? Mm hmm... Mm hmm...${prompt}
  13380: Altana kupo it all!${prompt}
  13381: The ones we previously petrified have escaped, and they're traipsing outside town!${prompt}

  13389: Most excellent explorer, please travel outside town and round up these recidivist reprobates!${prompt}
  13390: A mixture of moogle magic will enable you to ensconce the evildoers by subjugating them into stone shards.${prompt}

    Hey! You there!
    I've got a proposition of sorts for ${choice: 1}[a fresh-faced/an able-bodied/a world-class] adventurer such as yourself!${prompt}
  13427: You can call me Clarion Star. I've come from Jeuno, the lovely city in the northeast that connects the Quon and Mindartia continents.${prompt}
  13428: Specifically, I'm a representative of sorts from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies. You could call me a headhunter!${prompt}
  13429: Bwahaha! And the heads I am hunting today are those of bright-eyed explorers like yourself!${prompt}
  13430: So here's the deal. Not too long ago, the institute held an international symposium of sorts, at which we announced the development of a fascinatingly useful new type of magic.${prompt}
  13431: We made it available for everyone to utilize, and so we are trying it out here in Bastok and other places throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13432: We've chosen to call the new magic “Trust,” and as an official delegate of the institute, I want adventurers of your caliber to be the lucky first participants.${prompt}
  13433: |-
    So? What about it?
    Want to try it out?${prompt}
  13434: |-
    Try out the new magic?
    ${selection-lines}
    What have I got to lose?
    Magic scares me.${prompt}
  13435: An adventurer of sorts scared of magic? Pffft. Your loss, bud.${prompt}
  13436: That's the kind of spunk I like!${prompt}
  13437: You're surely aware that Bastok is no stranger to developing new technologies, and as such Cid and the Mythril Musketeers are conducting research of sorts into the application of this new magic.${prompt}
  13438: You know how they are--always at odds with the Beastman Confederate. They think that Trust might be able to help “bolster their forces,” they say.${prompt}
  13439: However! Not just anyone can use Trust.${prompt}
  13440: As you can imagine, the institute is thus collecting data of sorts in San d'Oria and Windurst, too, trying to get as many people as possible to participate.${prompt}
  13441: It should come as no surprise, then, that we have other representatives in those two nations. If you'd rather head over there, then we've got nothing more to discuss...${prompt}
  13442: But I'm sure the Mythril Musketeers here would appreciate any help you could give 'em.${prompt}
  13443: Let's cut to the quick. Helping them earns you the aid of a powerful warrior of sorts, which can only help you in your travels.${prompt}
  13444: |-
    Assist in Trust endeavors in Bastok?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  13445: If you're dead set on going elsewhere, I can't stop you...but I'm right here, and surely you'd rather not take a long journey.${prompt}
  13446: Bwahaha! Perfect response!${prompt}
  13447: '${choice: 2}[If that''s the case,/Okay! So] let''s get right to it. Before we go any further, let me give you this.${prompt}'
  13448: Your first task of sorts is to speak with Naji of the Mythril Musketeers, in the Metalworks. He can guide you further.${prompt}
  13449: Do you know where it is? Just head up the staircase behind me and cross the bridge to the west. Someone in the markets just past there can guide you further.${prompt}
  13450: Take the lift up to the second floor, where you'll find him waiting by the staircase that leads to the president's office. No one across the land is as faithful or skilled a guard as he.${prompt}
  13451: How are you finding those alter egos? Need an explanation of sorts as to how they work?${prompt}

    Whereabouts of Trust participants.
    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  13453: Trust is a new category of magic developed and announced by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies.${prompt}
  13454: Though it is a magic of sorts, unlike ordinary spells it does not require mana. Instead, it draws on the power of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  13455: Friendship, of course, crosses all boundaries, so Trust magic can be used regardless of your job.${prompt}
  13456: But for the love of all that is holy, don't go around bonding with alter egos in cities. It'll confuse everyone.${prompt}
  13457: Using Trust magic calls forth an alter ego of someone you have formed a strong personal bond with.${prompt}
  13458: They say friendships work best as a relationship between equals. Thus, the alter ego is only as strong as the person who willed it into existence.${prompt}
  13459: The alter ego will gladly fight by your side, but you will be unable to issue it direct orders.${prompt}
  13460: Research of sorts is ongoing, but it might take a while for any concrete progress to be made.${prompt}
  13461: When you wish to release an alter ego from service, you only need speak to it.${prompt}
  13462: It goes without saying that if an alter ego falls in battle, it will vanish into thin air. But don't fret--you can summon it again once a certain period of time has passed.${prompt}
  13463: Trust magic is quite aptly named. It calls forth an alter ego of sorts using the power of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  13464: To employ its powers, you must first find and befriend one who is allowed to harness them.${prompt}
  13465: If they do not listen to your request, then perhaps they don't think highly enough of you. Get the town talking about your deeds and I'm sure they'll give you another chance. If they still won't listen--well, you just come back to me.${prompt}
  13466: Of course, they still might not want to be friends. Maybe you're like me and doomed to be forever alone! Bwahaha! <Sob>${prompt}
  13467: 'Oh ho${choice: 5}[/, I almost forgot]! There is another way to utilize this magic. There are ongoing investigations of sorts into how to call forth an alter ego without directly meeting the person.${prompt}'
  13468: It takes a little something special, but if you find a scroll with this exceptional ability, all you need do is give it to me.${prompt}

  13485: '...An apparition, you say?${prompt}'
  13486: Ah, the fresh face of youth as they acquire a new alter ego. Never shall I tire of it.${prompt}
  13487: I'll let you in on something--the Trust initiative is being spread beyond the five races...with some very interesting results.${prompt}
  13488: Close your eyes and go to your happy place, where trust and friendship and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love blossom like flax flowers in a meadow.${prompt}
  13489: What an amazing success of sorts!${prompt}
  13490: So many of our trials ended in failure. I kept hoping it might work...but this--this is beyond my wildest dreams!${prompt}
  13491: H-how did you know that it's called “Trust”!? Were you at the symposium?${prompt}
  13492: Ohhh, I see. You got a lesson of sorts in one of the other nations. This makes it simple. How's about undertaking Trust experiments here in Bastok?${prompt}
  13493: 'Impressive! It''s no small feat to acquire ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt}'
  13494: Doctor Monberaux is a powerful person of sorts in Jeuno. Having an alter ego of him will make your journey that much easier.${prompt}
  13495: The good doctor was a bit surprised to be paid a visit by the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies. I think he expected a high-ranking friend of his to be chosen first.${prompt}
  13496: You see, his friend Wolf... No, I don't suppose it's our place to talk about that.${prompt}
  13497: Close your eyes while picturing Doctor Monberaux and go to your happy place, where trust and friendship and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love blossom like flax flowers in a meadow.${prompt}
  13498: It's a smashing success!${prompt}

  13651: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  13652: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  13653: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  13654: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  13655: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  13656: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  13657: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  13658: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  13659: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  13660: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  13661: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  13662: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13663: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  13664: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  13665: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  13666: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  13667: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  13668: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  13669: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  13670: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  13671: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13672: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  13673: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  13674: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  13675: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  13676: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  13677: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  13678: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  13679: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  13680: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  13681: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  13682: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  13683: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  13684: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13685: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  13686: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  13687: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  13688: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  13689: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  13690: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  13691: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  13692: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  13693: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  13694: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  13695: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  13696: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  13697: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  13698: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  13699: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  13700: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  13701: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  13702: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  13703: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  13704: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  13705: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  13706: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}

  13781: An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt}
  13782: I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt}
  13783: 'Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt}'
  13784: I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt}
  13785: When I fell before you...${prompt}
  13786: '...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt}'
  13787: I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt}
  13788: And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt}
  13789: This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt}
  13790: Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt}

    What else could it be?
    No. It's something more...${prompt}
  13796: Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt}
  13797: A keen eye, as always.${prompt}
  13798: The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt}
  13799: As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  13800: I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt}
  13801: And those...${prompt}
  13802: '...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt}'
  13803: I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt}
  13804: Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt}
  13805: And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt}
  13806: You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt}
  13807: At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt}
  13808: Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt}
  13809: So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt}
  13810: One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt}
  13811: Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt}
  13812: |-
    False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...
    The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt}
  13813: Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt}
  13814: Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt}
  13815: Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”
  13816: Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt}
  13817: No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt}
  13818: '...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt}'
  13819: You must not. You cannot.${prompt}
  13820: Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt}
  13821: Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt}
  13822: There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt}
  13823: You are the culmination of all your experiences.

  13832: He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt}

  13858: Yes, words absolutely fail me at how your outfit accentuates your, um...curves? Well, a job well done, even though I would normally hope for something a little more family friendly.${prompt}
  13859: Ladies and gentlemen, things are really starting to heat up in today's event, with people coming from far and wide to show all Bastok that they've got what it takes to become our champion.${prompt}
  13860: Who'll be next to take the stage and wow us with their devastatingly accurate and altogether embarrassing representation of famous Bastokers?${prompt}
  13861: Hey, I don't think “embarrassing” is the best word to use here...${prompt}
  13862: Our next three contestants are ready to take the stage! Here they come, so give them a big round of applause!${prompt}
  13863: Yes, feast your eyes on these wonderful reimaginings of real-life stars! Ogle them from head to toe and take in every last nook and cranny of their delectable forms!${prompt}
  13864: O-ogle? Delectable!?${prompt}
  13865: You all did such fantastic jobs! I would have mistaken you for the real thing!
  13866: Let's cut now to the judges and see what their frank assessments are. Judges, take it away!${prompt}
  13867: I gotta say, it took a lot of guts for you to choose Ayame, but that's one heck of a show you've put on!${prompt}
  13868: Ayame, fourth member of the Mythril Musketeers, is known for her grace in attitude and attire, as well as her skill on the field of battle.${prompt}
  13869: I would have expected many more people to choose to dress up as her, but it looks like you blew the competition away before they could even come out!${prompt}
  13870: No one wanted to choose me...
  13871: Huh!?
  13872: And if it isn't the woman, the myth, the legend herself! Ayame, would you give us your impression of the contestant's best attempt at reproducing your loveliness?${prompt}
  13873: |-
    Uh...
    Well, yes, it certainly is quite the sight.${prompt}
  13874: I might not be the, uh, most popular choice, but I'm touched that someone chose me as their inspiration.${prompt}
  13875: Oh, no, Ayame, it has nothing to do with popularity! People are just so blinded by your brilliance that no one felt they could even hold a candle to you. Isn't that right?${prompt}
  13876: Oh, yes! Of course! I'm, um, sorry that I couldn't hold a candle...${prompt}
  13877: And that's a big fat no from me! It seems our participant finally realized that they can't cut the mustard!${prompt}
  13878: Thanks...I guess?${prompt}
  13879: That's right, Ayame is just completely untouchable!${prompt}
  13880: Let's move on to our next contestant, shall we?${prompt}
  13881: Wow, I can't believe that someone would actually choose Azima, perhaps the stuffiest woman in all of Bastok!${prompt}
  13882: When I see your stunning profile, as wrinkled and gnarled as the old oak tree mere moments before it is felled by the lumberjack...${prompt}
  13883: I think back on my own mother, may she rest in peace...${prompt}
  13884: What ya blabbering on about, talking about me like I'm some old hag!?${prompt}
  13885: Urk--!
  13886: Why, if it isn't the esteemed Azima herself, here to give us her frank assessment of our challenger!${prompt}
  13887: Oh no, you don't escape that easily, young lady. I heard every word you said!${prompt}
  13888: N-n-no! Don't hurt me! I was just providing some color commentary!${prompt}
  13889: Hmmm. I suppose I could give ya an honest opinion.
  13890: Try learning some respect for your elders!${prompt}
  13891: Look at the fire in her eyes--obviously a reflection of the pile of hot garbage she sees before her!${prompt}
  13892: H-hey! I did my best...${prompt}
  13893: And yet another catastrophic failure abandons the stage! Azima's biting tongue remains too much to bear!${prompt}
  13894: I can't believe youngsters these days...${prompt}
  13895: Don't let this put a damper on your spirits, folks, for the show must go on!${prompt}
  13896: Would you take a look at this--a recreation of the magnificent Iron Eater, whose steely gaze can silence even the loudest of crying babies!${prompt}
  13897: True to his name, he can devour even the toughest of metals!${prompt}
  13898: I really don't think that he--${prompt}
  13899: For this contestant, let's hear from one of our female judges!${prompt}
  13900: I-Iron Eater?${prompt}
  13901: Amazing! Even Hilda is fooled by the costume's incredibly high degree of accuracy!${prompt}
  13902: Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!${prompt}
  13903: Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--${prompt}
  13904: But no, our contestant is not, in fact, the real thing!${prompt}
  13905: Wh-what the--!?
  13906: So, Hilda, what do you say!?${prompt}
  13907: Our challenger looks like Iron Eater, but the mannerisms are missing a little...je ne sais quoi.${prompt}
  13908: Je-ne-sais-what now?${prompt}
  13909: Ahhh, I think I get it. No matter how accurate you can recreate the outfit, it is all for naught unless you can properly mimic the original's quirks! Yes, another person for our ever-growing trash heap!${prompt}
  13910: Marin...I think you're being a bit too harsh on everyone.${prompt}
  13911: So crawl back under the rock you call home and show not your face again!${prompt}
  13912: Feast your eyes on our next model--a true sight to behold!${prompt}
  13913: Why, look at the aura of loserness emanating from him! Absolutely true to the original!${prompt}
  13914: Can't you be a little more positive!?${prompt}
  13915: Let's hear from one of our female judges. Hilda?${prompt}
  13916: I-is that Naji!?${prompt}
  13917: Wow! If she really thinks that's Naji, the costume must be perfect!${prompt}
  13918: Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!${prompt}
  13919: Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--${prompt}
  13920: I've, uh, got some unfortunate news. Naji was scheduled to give a few words, but I'm afraid he can't be here today.${prompt}
  13921: Oh no! What a terrible turn of events!
  13922: But, uh, our audience remains unfazed by this unexpected twist!${prompt}
  13923: Yet someone just like him is right up there on the stage.${prompt}
  13924: Ah, and you mean to say that our contestant is close enough to the real Naji.${prompt}
  13925: Or, to put it another way, everything would have turned out the same with or without Naji here!${prompt}
  13926: I don't think you should be putting words in her mouth...${prompt}
  13927: Anyway, thank you, Naji! I'm sure your efforts will be reflected in your final score!${prompt}
  13928: |-
    And next, we've got--
    Ack!${prompt}
  13929: Zeid...
  13930: Ha ha ha!
  13931: Amazing costume! This is clearly the pinnacle of mankind's achievement!${prompt}
  13932: You don't know how difficult it was to get ahold of all this rare equipment!${prompt}
  13933: All that mythril set me back an arm and a leg.${prompt}
  13934: Mythril...?${prompt}
  13935: You do cut an impressive pose, to be sure, but there's something about you that isn't quite Zeid-like...${prompt}
  13936: Ah, yes! Now that's more like the Zeid I know.${prompt}
  13937: This costume is absolutely perfect! You should follow this young man's lead and make your Zeid outfit more like his!${prompt}
  13938: You there! I'm enlisting you into our little show. Come up onto the stage!${prompt}
  13939: Yes, you! Come on, being asked to participate in such a wonderful show is quite the honor! Get your rear in gear!${prompt}
  13940: I, uh, just came here to talk to Oggbi...${prompt}
  13941: Of course, of course! What Oggbi thinks of your outfit is quite important indeed! So take the stage and hear just what he thinks of your getup!${prompt}
  13942: Oggbi, I'd really prefer to talk someplace quieter...${prompt}
  13943: So, judges, what do you have to say about this magnificent Zeid costume?${prompt}
  13944: I don't think I've ever seen a more impressive Zeid! Everything is just as it should be--the way you walk, the way you talk...it's uncannily close to the real thing!${prompt}
  13945: Wherever did you get such wonderful equipment? It's absolutely marvelous!${prompt}
  13946: I don't think the real Zeid is supposed to be in Bastok right now...${prompt}
  13947: Why, even Oggbi is fooled by the realism that our newest contestant exudes! Spectacular!${prompt}
  13948: Why, Zeid-alike, I think our judges are beyond impressed by the extent of your efforts!${prompt}
  13949: What the heck is going on?${prompt}
  13950: It's like you're actually him...!${prompt}
  13951: <Sigh>...
  13952: While I'd love to be able to chitchat with you more, Zeid-alike, we've got some more contestants to get through!${prompt}
  13953: And without further ado, here's our next challenger...
  13954: '${choice: 0}[Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh]!${prompt}'
  13955: Why, this is the costume to end all costumes! Look at how ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] positively gleams with radiance!${prompt}
  13956: I bet our maven of fashion, Brygid, is brimming with pride at how you've really helped bring the show together!${prompt}
  13957: I'm impressed by the accuracy of your attempt. But my opinions don't matter as much as the judges'!${prompt}
  13958: Surely the audience also appreciates all the effort you put into your appearance!${prompt}
  13959: Well, you certainly do have an...interesting take, to be sure! Words fail me.${prompt}
  13960: So, uh, Ken! Take it away!${prompt}
  13961: I...well...yes, words fail me, too.${prompt}
  13962: '...${prompt}'
  13963: Yes, yes, this is exceptional. The time and effort you must have put into this is astounding.${prompt}
  13964: I absolutely love it. I'd love to have you wait on me hand and foot...or is that asking a bit too much?${prompt}
  13965: Something is a little off...but then again, Naji himself is usually a little off, too.${prompt}
  13966: You're right, Cid. Naji always did have a couple screws loose.${prompt}
  13967: Hahaha!${prompt}
  13968: You put nearly no thought and effort into this, did you? Yet that in and of itself is rather Naji-esque.${prompt}
  13969: Speaking of Naji, it's about time for him to pay his tab...${prompt}
  13970: We were scheduled to hear a few words from Naji himself, but unfortunately he can't be with us today.${prompt}
  13971: So instead, Ken will give us the final word!${prompt}
  13972: M-me!? Well...thanks for coming!${prompt}
  13973: And there we have it, folks! A big round of applause for our Naji lookalike!${prompt}
  13974: Hang on...${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks nothing like Azima.${prompt}
  13975: O-oh no. I can feel all the war memories come flooding back...${prompt}
  13976: I may have only caught a glimpse of her once, but that matronly figure cannot be denied.${prompt}
  13977: Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I remember once having thought that she was the wickedest of witches.${prompt}
  13978: War memories? What the--${prompt}
  13979: My goodness, you certainly have Azima down to a T. I can feel her gaze of self-superiority bearing down on me even now.${prompt}
  13980: Yes, you certainly do have the same air of competence about you.${prompt}
  13981: Azima and I have a long history. Why, it was she who introduced me to my now-husband.${prompt}
  13982: Really? She did that!?${prompt}
  13983: Wait, this is supposed to be an Azima outfit? Hmm...${prompt}
  13984: Haha! For a moment, I thought I misheard, too!${prompt}
  13985: And now we'll hear from Azima herself!${prompt}
  13986: “The Hermitess of the Highlands”...${prompt}
  13987: The what!?${prompt}
  13988: Yes, that is what they used to call me! And you, young one, can certainly make something from nothing.${prompt}
  13989: I have no idea what you're on about, Azima, but thanks for your insight! A big round of applause!${prompt}
  13990: Outstanding work, adventurer! You took someone who doesn't really stand out from the crowd and brought them to life!${prompt}
  13991: Workers of all stripes really deserve more recognition for their efforts. Why, even my apron was made by a skilled laborer such as him.${prompt}
  13992: And let's all be thankful that no one but you wears something like that.${prompt}
  13993: Black Mud and I share a long history of camaraderie. I was prepared to give you zero points if you didn't do him justice...but you have.${prompt}
  13994: I just wish he was a little better at reading maps.${prompt}
  13995: Cid, can you help jog my memory? I can't properly recall how Black Mud dresses.${prompt}
  13996: Hahaha, me neither! In fact, who is Black Mud, anyway?${prompt}
  13997: And now for a few words from Black Mud himself!${prompt}
  13998: If you're ever on the lookout for rare materials from Tavnazia, Adoulin, and places beyond, be sure to visit me, and I'll place them on order for you. Black Mud, here for all your everyday needs!${prompt}
  13999: Um, you're not here for the free advertising. We're all waiting for your comments on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] outfit.${prompt}
  14000: I don't know what this is all about, but if you're using my likeness, you need to pay the proper compensation--${prompt}
  14001: Yes, yes, thank you, Black Mud! Now go back to where you came from, to the rousing applause of our audience!${prompt}
  14002: Why, I didn't think it was possible for someone to recreate Michea so faithfully!${prompt}
  14003: Her wares have always impressed me with an inner warmth that can only come from someone who truly loves their craft, and you have brought that same warmth to your costume.${prompt}
  14004: As warm as your wonderful meals, Hilda.${prompt}
  14005: Oh, Oggbi, you're making me blush! Maybe I'll have to make you a little extra next time you stop by.${prompt}
  14006: I think you did a good job of emulating Michea. What do you think, Cid?${prompt}
  14007: Hmmm... A goldsmith, huh? I think maybe I should order my special someone a new ring...${prompt}
  14008: Dalzakk, if only you were here to see this... But I guess ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]'s just a contestant, not the real thing.${prompt}
  14009: Michea currently works as a goldsmith here in Bastok, but she originally hails from San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14010: Oh, maybe that's why I can't quite place the outfit.${prompt}
  14011: No, I think it's because the entire getup is all wrong.${prompt}
  14012: And finally, a few words from Michea herself!${prompt}
  14013: Of all the people you could have chosen, I'm humbled and honored that you chose me.${prompt}
  14014: This entire event has been such a joy, and it helped me to reaffirm that fashion is an important part of everyone's lives.${prompt}
  14015: But there is one thing that I don't understand.${prompt}
  14016: Why aren't you giving out points for accessories!? I'm a goldsmith, and I can say with confidence that accessories are the glue that holds an outfit together!${prompt}
  14017: The next time you hold this event, be sure to give them their proper due! I'll be happy to lend my expertise to the panel.${prompt}
  14018: Thank you, Michea, for that absolutely riveting--if rather out of place--tirade! We would expect nothing less from a Bastokan merchant!${prompt}
  14019: A big round of applause for Michea and our competitor!${prompt}
  14020: I'm quite impressed at how you've made Nbu Latteh really come to life!${prompt}
  14021: Yes, it's astounding. Perhaps it's because you share a bond as adventurers?${prompt}
  14022: Nbu Latteh is an adventurer? Really?${prompt}
  14023: In the flesh. She's as fast as a famished chocobo and never lets prey elude her.${prompt}
  14024: That's odd. I heard stories from the guards that...you know what? Forget I said anything.${prompt}
  14025: Hmmm. I certainly have seen worse...but I've also seen better.${prompt}
  14026: Yes, although we do appreciate the efforts you've put into replicating her one-of-a-kind charms.${prompt}
  14027: I'm not sure “charms” are what's lacking here...${prompt}
  14028: I'll tell you what's lacking--ale! I need more ale!${prompt}
  14029: Nbu Latteh is an adventurer who is often spotted in Bastok Mines. Ah, yes, doesn't she have a lovely daughter...?${prompt}
  14030: Not that we see her too much these days. I wonder what she's up to.${prompt}
  14031: Well, she is an adventurer. But I don't recall ever seeing her dressed in...that.${prompt}
  14032: Thank you for your assessment, judges. Normally we'd ask Nbu Latteh to come say a few words herself, but she's a bit tied up at the moment.${prompt}
  14033: So instead, we've got her fan club here to comment on her behalf!${prompt}
  14034: Ah, hello! I'm Roh Latteh, here on behalf of my mother.${prompt}
  14035: Oh, aren't you just the cutest thing! I could gobble you right up! Maybe I should trade my brother for you.${prompt}
  14036: '...That wouldn''t be so bad.${prompt}'
  14037: If I do a really good job, she said she'll give me some candy, so...I'll try my hardest!${prompt}
  14038: Oh, how precious and well-behaved you are! We might just have some cookies for you too!${prompt}
