  6968: |-
    Exactly!
    You'd better have something interesting to say.
    Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt}
  6969: Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  6970: Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt}
  6971: |-
    Yes.
    Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt}
  6972: Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt}
  6973: Excenmille was furious.${prompt}
  6974: Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt}
  6975: According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt}
  6976: However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt}
  6977: That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt}
  6978: Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt}

    You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt}
  6986: That is what I propose.${prompt}
  6987: |-
    Conflict...
    An interesting idea...${prompt}
  6988: There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt}
  6989: However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt}
  6990: If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt}

  7010: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  7011: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  7012: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7013: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  7014: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  7015: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  7016: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  7017: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  7018: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  7019: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  7020: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7021: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  7022: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  7023: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7024: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  7025: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  7026: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  7027: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  7028: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  7029: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  7030: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  7031: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  7032: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  7033: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  7034: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  7035: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  7036: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  7037: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  7038: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  7039: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  7041: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  7042: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  7043: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  7044: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  7045: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  7046: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  7047: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  7048: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'
  7049: |-
    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  7050: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  7051: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  7052: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  7053: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'
  7054: |-
    In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:
    Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt}
  7055: |-
    Level 40 matches: 31～40
    Level 50 matches: 41～50
    Level 60 matches: 51～60
    Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt}
  7056: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt}
  7057: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt}
  7058: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt}

  7127: Remember, soldier, as long as I'm alive, the schedule I am about to tell you is set in stone! Try to find room in your puny head to fit it in!${prompt}
  7128: I understand this schedule may seem confusing, but it is really quite simple. Perhaps you should try writing the information down?${prompt}
  7129: Ah yes, I almost forgot to mention that once you have participated in a match, you must wait a short period until you can make your next entry. Take this into consideration when planning which matches you will attend.${prompt}

    Hmmm... I don't know...
    Your rank is awfully low. How am I supposed to trrrust someone who hasn't prrroved themselves to the nation?${prompt}

    Your air...
    Your attire...
    An adventurer, I assume.
    Have you come looking to register for Conflict?${prompt}
  7145: Let me introduce myself. I am Excenmille M Aurchiat, acting Conflict Commander of the San d'Orian forces.${prompt}
  7146: I have heard good things about you, ${name-player}. Your loyalty to the crown is well-renowned throughout the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7147: I believe that you would make a fine addition to our ranks, and I welcome you.${prompt}
  7148: You have come to register for Conflict, have you not?${prompt}
  7149: Well, before you make a hasty decision, let me explain the finer details of what has transpired in recent months.${prompt}
  7150: It all began at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly held in conjunction with the International Commerce Convention. His Majesty, Prince Trion, made the following proposal...${prompt}
  7151: |-
    Do you understand?
    I was whom the prince was speaking of. And it is I who believe that your unmatched loyalty, bravery, and ability are necessary for the Kingdom's victory.${prompt}
  7152: If you are truly a servant of the crown, you shall not object to raising your sword in the name of the royaulais.${prompt}
  7153: |-
    I see...
    I realize that you adventurers have other matters that keep you busy.
    However, do not forget the debt you owe to the Kingdom that provides for you.${prompt}
  7154: Wait a minute, don't tell me... You'rrre one of the Federation's adventurers, right? And you want to sign up for Conflict?${prompt}
  7155: |-
    Hmmm...
    Your rank seems high enough... OK! You'rrre in.
    I could use a veteran like you to whip some of my younger mercenaries into shape.${prompt}
  7156: My name's Mhabi Molkot. Up until a few days ago, I was Captain of the Terrible Tigresses, the most fearrred group of Mithra Mercenaries in all of Windurst!${prompt}
  7157: And then all of a sudden, they make me Conflict Commander...${prompt}
  7158: |-
    Anyway, I said you'rrre in, so you'rrre in already!
    What? Don't tell me you're having second thoughts!${prompt}
  7159: Let me tell you a little about what's been going on in the past few months. It all starrrted at some stuffy conference to talk about the conquest...${prompt}
  7160: And there you have it. The bigwigs up in the ministries probably hearrrd that I was a professional Conflict player back in my homeland, and entrrrusted me with the reins of this runaway horse.${prompt}
  7161: Maybe it's my instincts talking, but you look like the type who's dying for a chance at the hunt. What do you say?${prompt}
  7162: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[Hmph. Well, you've got guts. You're the first man who's ever turned this cat down./You're turrrning me down?]

  7163: |-
    What!?
    You think you're ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] enough to join our nation's Conflict forces!?${prompt}

  7165: Well, soldier, I've scraped bigger things than you off the bottom of my boot!${prompt}
  7166: |-
    Listen up!
    My name is Invincible Shield, Legatus of the third division of the Republican Legion.${prompt}
  7167: The president himself has made me Conflict Commander and put the Bastokan forces under my control. If you join, you will serve under me and under me only!${prompt}
  7168: |-
    What!? You have questions about Conflict!?
    I don't remember anyone giving you permission to ask questions, soldier!${prompt}
  7169: |-
    I will let it slide this time, but it better not happen again!
    Now, listen up!${prompt}
  7170: |-
    Did you understand what I just told you!?
    It is an honor and a privilege to participate in Conflict!${prompt}
  7171: |-
    You want to be a hero!? Well, here's your chance, soldier!
    Sign this application form and you can be on your way!${prompt}
  7172: |-
    More time!?
    And I thought you were more than just a whining sissy!
    The Republic doesn't need any more wimps like you!
    You are dismissed!${prompt}
  7173: So, you have finally realized your debt to the Kingdom and decided to repay that debt through service in Conflict?${prompt}
  7174: Well, look who's back. I knew you couldn't rrresist the excitement of Conflict. You're ready to sign up, right?${prompt}
  7175: |-
    I see that you have finally come to your senses, soldier!
    Now sign this application and you can be on your way!${prompt}
  7176: |-
    Excellent.
    However, there is one last task I must ask you to perform before approving your application.${prompt}
  7177: Travel to Bastok and Windurst and meet with their leaders. You need not worry with the details. They already know you will be coming.${prompt}
  7178: I also wish you to deliver these letters to the two nations' Conflict Commanders.${prompt}
  7179: A lofty Galka, Ginu...Invincible Shield, will be waiting for you in Bastok.${prompt}
  7180: And I recall the Commander of Windurst's forces was a Mithra named Mhabi...something-or-other. I have such trouble remembering foreign names.${prompt}
  7181: |-
    That is all. You may set off immediately.
    I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7182: |-
    Wonderful!
    I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.${prompt}
  7183: To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.${prompt}
  7184: And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.${prompt}
  7185: I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.${prompt}
  7186: Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!${prompt}
  7187: |-
    Heh heh heh...
    When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!${prompt}
  7188: |-
    You've made the right choice, soldier!
    From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!${prompt}
  7189: |-
    Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once!
    You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!${prompt}
  7190: |-
    What!?
    Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!?
    The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!${prompt}
  7191: |-
    After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations!
    Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!${prompt}
  7192: |-
    Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst!
    Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!${prompt}
  7193: |-
    You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7194: Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt}
  7195: Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.${prompt}
  7196: What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7197: Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.${prompt}
  7198: Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!${prompt}
  7199: |-
    Now listen up, soldier!
    After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot!
    And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7200: |-
    Welcome back from your journey.
    ......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.${prompt}
  7201: |-
    Well done, ${name-player}.
    Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.${prompt}
  7202: |-
    Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost!
    ...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, ${name-player}. You've just made my day.${prompt}
  7203: Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.${prompt}
  7204: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!${prompt}
  7205: |-
    If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives!
    Don't you forget that, soldier!${prompt}
  7206: |-
    Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform!
    Get moving!${prompt}
  7207: 'I commend you, ${name-player}. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7208: This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.${prompt}
  7209: As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.${prompt}
  7210: |-
    Ah, I almost forgot.
    Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.${prompt}
  7211: |-
    Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them.
    That is all.${prompt}
  7212: 'OK! You''rrre done. Here''s your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  7213: With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.${prompt}
  7214: And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7215: |-
    Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
    Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.${prompt}
  7216: They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!${prompt}
  7217: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  7218: The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.${prompt}
  7219: We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!${prompt}
  7220: In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!${prompt}
  7221: |-
    While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7222: I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...${prompt}
  7223: |-
    All right, soldier, listen up!
    Repeat after me the following rules!${prompt}
  7224: Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...${prompt}
  7225: An exquisite display of force, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7226: It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!${prompt}
  7227: Great job out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7228: The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!${prompt}
  7229: |-
    Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory!
    But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!${prompt}
  7230: |-
    Now get back out there, soldier!
    Do you want to live forever!?${prompt}
  7231: |-
    Unthinkable...
    A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.${prompt}
  7232: If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7233: |-
    I cannot believe what I am hearing...
    A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...${prompt}
  7234: Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7235: You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...${prompt}
  7236: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}! You'rrre making me look bad!${prompt}
  7237: |-
    Hissssss!
    You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...${prompt}
  7238: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!${prompt}
  7239: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!${prompt}
  7240: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Do not make me repeat these words, ${name-player}! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7241: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched!
    But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!${prompt}
  7242: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7243: I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...${prompt}
  7244: Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!${prompt}
  7245: |-
    A draw!
    A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!${prompt}
  7246: |-
    You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  7247: So close, yet so farrr...${prompt}
  7248: Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?${prompt}
  7249: 'You wish to know about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.${prompt}'
  7250: While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.${prompt}
  7251: You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7252: |-
    You want to see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Here, take a look.
    These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.${prompt}
  7253: When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.${prompt}
  7254: He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7255: |-
    Listen up, soldier!
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will not guarantee you victory, but it can make the difference in a close battle!${prompt}
  7256: In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!${prompt}
  7257: And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!${prompt}
  7258: |-
    Ask for an earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7259: A wise decision, ${name-player}. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.${prompt}
  7260: |-
    Here, let me put it on for you.
    Hmmm...
    You look great!
    Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!${prompt}
  7261: |-
    Smart move, soldier!
    Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!${prompt}
  7262: I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.${prompt}
  7263: Well, if you think that you don't need one...${prompt}
  7264: If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!${prompt}
  7265: 'What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  7266: 'How''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} worrrking? Or maybe you don''t need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.${prompt}'
  7267: 'Is there something wrong with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt}'
  7268: |-
    Return the earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  7269: Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.${prompt}
  7270: Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.${prompt}
  7271: |-
    Well, it's about time!
    I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7272: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?${prompt}
  7273: |-
    ???
    If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.${prompt}
  7274: |-
    Does this look like Windurst, maggot!?
    If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force!
    Move! Move! Move!${prompt}
  7275: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!${prompt}
  7276: |-
    Are you talking to me?
    Are you talking to me?
    Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.${prompt}
  7277: |-
    What is that smell!?
    Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer!
    If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!${prompt}
  7278: |-
    Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license...
    I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.${prompt}
  7279: Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...${prompt}
  7280: |-
    Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation!
    What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!${prompt}
  7281: Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?${prompt}
  7282: |-
    You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers.
    However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.${prompt}
  7283: |-
    Wait, don't tell me...
    You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!?
    (Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)${prompt}
  7284: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?
    Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7285: |-
    So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?
    It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt}
  7286: I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt}
  7287: What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7288: |-
    .........
    How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt}
  7289: |-
    You!
    Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!${prompt}
  7290: A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...${prompt}
  7291: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt}
  7292: Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt}
  7293: What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?${prompt}
  7294: |-
    .........
    If he thinks that I...${prompt}
  7295: |-
    You!
    You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7296: A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7297: |-
    .........
    I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!${prompt}
  7298: |-
    You!
    Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!${prompt}
  7299: A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!${prompt}
  7300: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt}
  7301: |-
    You!
    You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!${prompt}
  7302: |-
    What is that you have there, maggot!?
    A shopping list from your mommy!?${prompt}

    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7305: |-
    Excellent show, ${name-player}!
    I have just received word that ${choice: 0}[you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].${prompt}
  7306: I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!${prompt}
  7307: I just received the news, ${name-player}! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.${prompt}
  7308: I applaud you on your skill! Maybe it's time I challenged you to a little one-on-one...${prompt}
  7309: 'Well, if it isn''t the pond scum I found floating on my toilet this morning... What is this? You mean to tell me that you ${choice: 0}[were awarded some fancy chevron!?/were the top scorer at the last Ballista match!?] I... I...${prompt}'
  7310: |-
    What are you looking at, soldier!? Haven't you seen anyone with dust in their eye!?
    Just because by some fluke you had a fine day on the Ballista field doesn't mean squat!
    Now get back out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7311: |-
    Welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research.
    I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.${prompt}
  7312: |-
    And you... You must be another young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] drawn here by the pungent but oh-so-sweet smell of science.
    An aspiring synergist! Am I right?${prompt}
  7313: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not now.
    Of course!${prompt}
  7314: |-
    Excellent! Your intellectual curiosity will serve you well as you embark on the path of science.
    Ours is a young discipline, with its greatest discoveries and breakthroughs yet to come, but I shall share with you the fruits of our research thus far.${prompt}
  7315: |-
    I see. I suppose the path of science is not for everyone.
    Should you ever find your curiosity piqued, the doors of our laboratory are always open.${prompt}
  7316: |-
    Let us start from square one. What is synergy?
    Why, synergy is synthesis taken to the nth degree!
    Synergists wield the powers of multiple elements, bringing them together in perfect balance to realize heretofore unimagined possibilities!${prompt}
  7317: |-
    And this is what makes synergy possible: the synergy furnace!
    Isn't she a beauty?${prompt}
  7318: Just pop open the top, toss in your materials along with your fewell--that's what we call the stuff that powers the thing--spin some wheels and pull some levers, and...voila! Prepare to be amazed by what comes out!${prompt}
  7319: |-
    ...In theory, at least.
    Our research is still in the early stages, and the recipes that we've managed to confirm are, as yet, few and far between.${prompt}
  7320: |-
    There are other complicating factors as well.
    Ingenious invention though it may be, the synergy furnace is yet but a prototype, and remains--how shall I say it--a bit unstable.${prompt}
  7321: |-
    As such, it is imperative that the operator exercise utmost caution to maintain the proper elemental balance at all times.
    In other words, fewell must be added in proper proportions, but with the contents of the furnace in a constant state of flux, this is no small task.${prompt}
  7322: |-
    Failure to maintain equilibrium may result in explosions, implosions, spontaneous combustions, or other unexpected and unpleasant results.
    Make no mistake: synergy is not a science for the faint of heart.${prompt}
  7323: |-
    Fortunately, there is good news.
    The synergy furnace, you see, is designed to allow for manipulation by multiple operators at once.${prompt}
  7324: Combine your knowledge and skill with that of your colleagues, master the process of maintaining equilibrium, and there is simply no limit to the wonders you may materialize. Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts!${prompt}
  7325: |-
    So what do you say?
    Think you're ready to give the synergy furnace a spin for yourself?${prompt}
  7326: |-
    Become a synergist?
    ${selection-lines}
    Maybe another time.
    Sign me up!${prompt}
  7327: |-
    Oh, it's you again.
    Don't tell me--your curiosity has gotten the better of you, hasn't it?${prompt}
  7328: |-
    Wonderful! Another test subj--er, budding synergist!
    First, we'll be needing to set you up with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7329: |-
    A what, you say?
    Put simply, it's a receptacle to hold your materials and fewell, designed to be used in conjunction with the communal synergy furnaces stationed about town.${prompt}
  7330: |-
    I would be happy to put one together for you, provided you furnish me with the components necessary for its construction.
    Let me see here...${prompt}
  7331: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and...
    Yes, yes...${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. That should be all we need.${prompt}
  7332: |-
    The ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the ${item-singular: 1[2]} can be acquired in abundance from the worms that inhabit Gustaberg.
    For the ${item-singular: 2[2]}, an expedition to the Palborough Mines might be in order.${prompt}
  7333: |-
    If you're acquainted with a good goldsmith, the ${item-singular: 3[2]} shouldn't be a problem.
    If not, there's always the auction house.${prompt}
  7334: All you need to do is trade these components to me, and prepare to enter the exciting world of synergy!${prompt}
  7335: |-
    What? You've forgotten which materials you need?
    Tsk tsk. Ah well, you wouldn't be the first absent-minded synergist.
    Now listen carefully this time...${prompt}
  7336: |-
    Stupendous! Can hardly wait to kick-start your career as a synergist, I see.
    Well, who am I to keep you waiting any longer?${prompt}
  7337: |-
    And there you have it! Your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, designed to be compatible with any synergy furnace.
    And as an added bonus to commemorate the birth of a new synergist, your first fill-up of fewell is on the house!${prompt}
  7338: |-
    My only regret is that I haven't the time to personally educate a promising young synergist like you on all the intricacies of our field.
    You should seek out the synergy engineers stationed throughout town. They're always eager to share their knowledge with new colleagues.${prompt}
  7339: |-
    Ah, yes. After you've honed your skills a bit, you should stop by the Alchemists' Guild.
    I haven't had the time to look into it myself, but word has it that their new invention has the synergistic community abuzz.${prompt}
  7340: |-
    Now, if you'll forgive me, my research calls.
    May your career in synergy be a fruitful one!${prompt}
  7341: |-
    Would that I had the time to discuss my latest discoveries with a fellow synergist!
    Sadly, I cannot afford even a second away from my experiments...${prompt}
  7342: ${prompt}
  7343: |-
    Well, well...if it isn't my prize pupil!
    That sparkle in your eyes tells me that you are well on your way down the path toward scientific enlightenment.${prompt}
  7344: |-
    Should you ever find your fewell stores running low, remember that it is a painless enough process to synthesize yourself some more.
    You need only prepare the corresponding crystal and rock, together with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  7345: '...The catch being that the procedure demands a certain degree of alchemical aptitude.${prompt}'
  7346: If you are in immediate need of fewell, I could provide you with a supply from my stock.${prompt}
  7347: |-
    Don't mention it, friend!
    After all, cooperation among synergists will only serve to further the advancement of our fair science.${prompt}
  7348: |-
    Obtain fewell?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 2[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 3[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 4[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 5[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 6[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Perhaps another time.${prompt}
  7349: |-
    You require more time to ponder your decision, yes?
    A common plight of the prudent synergist, as I know all too well.${prompt}
  7350: 'It is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you seek, yes?${prompt}'
  7351: |-
    Accept fewell?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7352: |-
    It is my pleasure to provide you with ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.
    May ${choice-plurality: 1}[it/they] serve you well!${prompt}
  7353: |-
    Greetings, and welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research!
    I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.${prompt}
  7354: |-
    While I would like nothing more than to expound on the wonders of synergy, I fear my experiments demand my undivided attention.
    I would encourage you to speak with one of our engineers stationed throughout town should you wish to learn more about our science.${prompt}
  7355: |-
    Ah, always a pleasure to encounter a fellow synergist!
    I see you've been keeping your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in fine fettle.${prompt}
  7356: Do you perchance find your fewell tanks running low after synergizing up a storm?${prompt}
  7357: In my capacity as a pedagogue of the synergistic arts, it is my firm belief that my pupils learn best from solving their problems by their own devices.${prompt}
  7358: |-
    That said, I would sooner see you in front of a furnace than fretting endlessly over a depleted fewell supply.
    Hence my offer.${prompt}
  7359: |-
    Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.
    What say you to my offer?${prompt}
  7360: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    By all means!
    Not today.${prompt}
  7361: |-
    So your fewell stock is sufficiently full?
    All the better, then.${prompt}
  7362: |-
    Then, if you will excuse me, I must return to my research.
    May your synergistic pursuits lead you to knowledge and enlightenment!${prompt}
  7363: |-
    Welcome back, my pupil.
    Do you find yourself in need of fewell today?${prompt}
  7364: |-
    Very well.
    Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.${prompt}
  7365: 'Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.${prompt}'
  7366: 'Yes, this is certainly ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. There can be no mistaking it.${prompt}'
  7367: |-
    As promised, I shall synthesize for you the fewell you desire.
    What shall it be?${prompt}
  7368: |-
    Very well! Now step back and gaze upon Professor Hildolf's Synthesis 101.
    This will be on the test, so you may want to take notes.${prompt}
  7369: '${color-alt: 121}Hildolf synthesized ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!'
  7370: |-
    Now that's some smooth synthesizing, if I do say so myself!
    And since my laboratory is already overflowing with fewell, why don't you take it all?${prompt}
  7371: Hm? Running low on fewell again, you say?${prompt}
  7372: |-
    I sympathize, but as my research affords me no time to help you today.
    Remember, the true synergist is ever resourceful. I leave you to your own devices.${prompt}
  7373: Of course I'm Cid. Who's asking? You certainly don't look like one of the adventurers I sent out on a mission...${prompt}
  7374: Oh? A memo for me?${prompt}
  7375: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7376: It's from...Midras. Of course, Junior!${prompt}
  7377: Let me get a look at that.${prompt}
  7378: What's that fool prattling on about now? Always a bit big for his britches.${prompt}
  7379: Hey, Raibaht! Bring me some of that 28-4.${prompt}
  7380: Idiot. Lucky for him we have the waypoints now, or he'd be completely up the creek.${prompt}
  7381: It was explosive powder you needed, yes? Sorry that my son made you come do his dirty work for him.${prompt}
  7382: Speaking of which, if he sent you here that means you came all the way from Adoulin.${prompt}
  7383: At least you didn't have to travel by boat. Those waypoints are innovation I can get behind. It's almost fearsome how much more advanced Adoulin is.${prompt}
  7384: <Sigh> I've got a lot left to learn.${prompt}
  7385: Raibaht, I've told you a thousand times--if you brought the thing, don't just stand there, say something!${prompt}
  7386: You never change, do you? <Sigh> Anyway, back to Junior.${prompt}
  7387: Here. This is what he's looking for.${prompt}
  7388: Oh, before I forget--how is the boy, anyway? He say anything?${prompt}
  7389: Chief, if you are concerned for the boy's well-being, you should just say so.${prompt}
  7390: Quiet, you! Stop butting in and get back to work!${prompt}
  7391: Yes, sir.${prompt}
  7392: You say he's keeping himself busy helping Amchuchu with her crop research, eh?${prompt}
  7393: That's good to hear! Energy and persistence conquer all things.${prompt}
  7394: Huh? Do I have any message for him?${prompt}
  7395: Hmm...he seems to be doing well enough for himself. Words of encouragement from his old man would probably just embarrass him.${prompt}
  7396: Come to think of it, if you run across Amchuchu, tell her thanks for looking after my boy.${prompt}
  7397: Well, don't let me keep you any longer. Junior's waiting.${prompt}
  7398: Cid, please, calm down.${prompt}
  7399: Who is it now!?${prompt}
  7400: ${name-player}! I'm in no mood for lollygagging, so out with it!
  7401: A letter from Amchuchu?${prompt}
  7402: I don't even have to open the damn thing to know what it's about. I've heard all about my good-for-nothing son!${prompt}
  7403: He's dead to me now!${prompt}
  7404: I've expelled him from my tutelage!${prompt}
  7405: Tell your precious Amchuchu that there's no need to look after that fool any longer.${prompt}
  7406: Chew on that!${prompt}
  7407: Now get the hell outta here!${prompt}
  7408: Before you arrived, someone from the Tenshodo paid us a visit, asking for Cid. He's been like that ever since.${prompt}
  7409: I don't know all the details, but I'll hang on to that letter just in case.${prompt}
  7410: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7411: Let's talk outside.${prompt}
  7412: Hmmm... What made Midras want to become an engineer?${prompt}
  7413: The only person who can answer that properly is Midras himself. Ah, but wait.${prompt}
  7414: I remember now. Back when he was still a boy, no older than ten. He got in a fight with one of the other children.${prompt}
  7415: The other child had a father who was seriously injured in the mining accident, and he took it all out on Midras. “If it weren't for your father's rotten powder, that explosion never would have happened!” or something like that.${prompt}
  7416: Midras was dumbfounded, and came to me for the truth. Sadly, it's not easy to lie to a child.${prompt}
  7417: He didn't say anything after that, but now that I think of it, that might have been the day.${prompt}
  7418: Ever since then, he would always be reading the explosives manual Cid gave him and would sometimes come to me with questions on mixtures and component ratios.${prompt}
  7419: That's about all I can remember, though. Hard to say if that's really what made him take up the hammer.${prompt}
  7420: What? You want to know where the accident happened?${prompt}
  7421: Listen, it's been over twenty years now. I don't go there anymore--none of us do, but I won't stop you if you're serious.${prompt}
  7422: It was in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor. The explosion happened down the unfinished shaft around G-8. I'll never forget that shaft.${prompt}
  7423: It's been ages, though. I wouldn't get your hopes up of finding anything down there.${prompt}
  7424: The accident happened in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor and head to the unfinished shaft around G-8.${prompt}
  7425: You're back. Not so loud.${prompt}
  7426: Hrmmm... You know who knows the right explosive mixtures for the bedrock in Palborough better than anyone?${prompt}
  7427: That's right. Midras.${prompt}
  7428: I don't know if he'd be willing to help, but he's the one you need to talk to.${prompt}
  7429: That kid would always be hanging around the port docks when something was on his mind. If they have docks over in Adoulin, I'm guessing that's where he'd be.${prompt}
  7430: I've got to get back to work now.
  7431: Talk to Midras. He'll know which explosives you need.${prompt}
  7432: Wh-what!? You say you...saw them?${prompt}
  7433: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.'
  7434: This...${prompt}
  7435: This was Sirius's ring.${prompt}
  7436: Sirius...founder of the Steaming Sheep, husband to Hilda...and a good friend.${prompt}
  7437: And this... This is Almid's locket.${prompt}
  7438: Almid, father of Midras. His real father.${prompt}
  7439: Gah...Gahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  7440: Pathetic! And here I was all this time feeling useless, while they were waiting for me the whole time in there!${prompt}
  7441: If only I could have done something...anything. At the time of the accident, we all felt that way, but there was nothing to be done but clear the rubble and bury the bodies.${prompt}
  7442: Hey, Raibaht! Come in here and give me a hand!${prompt}
  7443: At times like this, you're better off laughing!${prompt}
  7444: Yeesh! What's with that racket? If you don't quit that, I might just start calling you “Loud Mountain” or something!${prompt}
  7445: Of course, Chief. You may call me whatever you wish!${prompt}
  7446: Hey, listen. Don't tell Cid about any of this. It's better if he doesn't know.${prompt}
  7447: Hurry and take that locket to Midras. He should have it.${prompt}
  7448: Hopefully it will help him understand his real father.${prompt}
  7449: I will take the ring to Hilda. It's hers now.${prompt}
  7450: Hey, Raibaht! You got ears on your head!?${prompt}
  7451: Yes, Chief. I have ears.
  7452: 'Well, then. I think I''ll finish early today and go out for a big plate...of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.'
  7453: 'Obtained key item: ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7454: What can I do for you?${prompt}
  7455: |-
    C'est la Guilde des Forgerons de Bastok.
    La nôtre est la vraie - celle de San d'Oria n'a même pas la moitié de ce que nous avons !${prompt}
  7456: |-
    C'est la Salle de la Poudre à Canon.
    Tout ici est le produit du dur labeur du chef.${prompt}
  7457: La Salle de la Poudre à Canon devait aussi devenir une guilde, mais l'accident a tout changé...${prompt}
  7458: Avons-nous l'air d'avoir le temps de papoter avec chaque aventurier qui entre ici ?${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Bonne chance pour votre mission.
    Les Bastokers aiment faire les choses correctement, alors évitez les ennuis et suivez leurs règles.${prompt}
  7460: |-
    Vous avez terminé votre mission avec succès.
    Félicitations, et continuez ainsi.${prompt}
  7461: Présentez votre lettre de présentation si vous avez des affaires avec le consulat. Si vous n'en avez pas, veuillez quitter les lieux.${prompt}
  7462: |-
    Vous avez une lettre de présentation ?
    Bien. Allez parler au consul.${prompt}
  7463: Bonne chance. Je prie pour le dénouement réussi de votre mission.${prompt}
  7464: Il doit y avoir encore beaucoup de missions à accomplir à San d'Oria. Je prie également pour votre succès sur celles-ci.${prompt}
  7465: |-
    Les Bastokers n'ont aucun sens du style !
    Je ne comprends pas comment quelqu'un pourrait vivre dans un endroit aussi morne.
    Oh, comme je souhaite être de retour à San d'Oria !${prompt}
  7466: |-
    Oh, vous avez une lettre de présentation.
    Alors retournez là-bas et parlez au consul.${prompt}
  7467: |-
    On vous a donné un travail à faire, j'entends.
    Pourquoi ont-ils besoin de vous dans ces contrées reculées, je me demande ?${prompt}
  7468: |-
    Oh, vous êtes de retour.
    Je vous envie. Vous n'êtes pas coincé ici comme moi... vous pouvez toujours retourner à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7469: Les nations sans histoire, comme Bastok, manquent de tradition et d'élégance. Notre belle San d'Oria, en revanche, est le parfait exemple de style ordonné.${prompt}
  7470: |-
    Ah, vous avez une lettre d'introduction !
    Vite, vous devez aller parler au consul, au fond.${prompt}
  7471: |-
    Adieu, aventurier.
    Ce serait dommage de perdre quelqu'un comme vous dans un endroit comme celui-ci, si loin de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7472: C'est bon de vous voir en sécurité. Vous ne devriez pas vous attarder dans un endroit comme celui-ci. San d'Oria vous attend, mon ami. Allez-y tant que vous le pouvez !${prompt}
  7473: |-
    Oui, je suis le consul de Windurst--mais ce n'est qu'un sinécure.
    Personne ne voulait de ce poste, et je ne les blâme pas.${prompt}
  7474: |-
    Bonne chance pour votre mission !
    Les gens ici respectent les règles, alors vous devriez faire de même, sinon il y aura des ennuis-ennuis pour nous !${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Bon travail !
    Oh, et dites aux gens de Windurst et aux autres consuls que je leur dis "bonjour" quand vous y retournerez.${prompt}
  7476: |-
    Oui, c'est le consulat de Windurst.
    Windurst...ah, belle Windurst, comme tu me manques-wee...${prompt}
  7477: |-
    Une lettre d'introduction ?
    Vous venez de Windurst ! Dites-moi, comment vont les choses là-bas !?${prompt}
  7478: |-
    Oh, vous voulez des missions...
    Alors, parlez s'il vous plaît avec le Consul Patt-Pott...
    Ah, Windurst, comme tu me manques-wee...${prompt}
  7479: |-
    Vous allez là où il y a tous ces monstres, n'est-ce pas ?
    J'aimerais être de retour à Windurst...c'était si paisible là-bas.${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Vous êtes de retour.
    Alors vous retournez à Windurst ? Oh, comme je vous envie...${prompt}
  7481: |-
    Oh, bonjour ! Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst.
    Ah, mais nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous si vous n'avez pas de lettre d'introduction...${prompt}
  7482: |-
    Oh ! Vous avez une lettre d'introduction !
    Le consul voudra vous voir.
    Il est à l'arrière--allez-y directement.${prompt}
  7483: |-
    Oh ! Vous allez combattre et tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?
    Soyez prudent !${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Oh ! Content de vous revoir !
    Vous retournez à Windurst maintenant ?
    Dites à tout le monde là-bas que nous allons bien !${prompt}
  7485: |-
    Bonjour...?
    Oui, c'est le Consulat de Windurst.${prompt}
  7486: |-
    Une lettre d'introduction...?
    Allez parler au consul, là-bas.${prompt}
  7487: |-
    Vous allez combattre...?
    Bonne chance.${prompt}
  7488: |-
    Votre mission est terminée...?
    Faites le chemin jusqu'à Windurst en toute sécurité.${prompt}
  7489: |-
    Un aventurier, au Consulat de Jeuno ?
    Vous n'avez rien à faire ici.${prompt}
  7490: |-
    Vous êtes au Consulat de Jeuno.
    Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous à moins que vous ne soyez citoyen de Jeuno.${prompt}
  7491: |-
    Ici, c'est le Consulat de Jeuno.
    Il n'y a rien que nous puissions faire pour vous à moins que vous ne soyez Jeunois.${prompt}
  7492: |-
    C'est le Consulat de Jeuno.
    Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous à moins que vous ne possédiez la citoyenneté Jeunoise.${prompt}
  7493: |-
    Je suis désolé, mais je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
    Pourriez-vous revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
  7494: |-
    Vous êtes au Bureau de l'Assistant Présidentiel.
    Sir Lucius est très occupé pour le moment--essayez de ne pas le déranger, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7495: |-
    Oui, que voulez-vous avec le Département de l'Industrie ?
    Nous sommes très occupés, vous savez. Mais nous ne le serions pas si le grand patron n'était pas un amateur ignorant.${prompt}
  7496: |-
    Vous êtes au Département de l'Industrie.
    L'industrie est le moteur de notre nation, donc notre département gère essentiellement tout à Bastok.${prompt}
  7497: Les bons sénateurs comme moi prennent le temps d'écouter les requêtes des masses, contrairement à notre jeune et incompétent président.${prompt}
  7498: Heh-heh-heh. Vous êtes très aimable, votre seigneurie. Vous nous avez tant donné... Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7499: |-
    Je dois augmenter la production des Fonderies avant la fin de mon mandat ici.
    Je devrais commencer par augmenter le quota journalier de tout le monde...${prompt}
  7500: Ces managers qu'ils nous envoient sont tous les mêmes. Ils nous font faire tout le travail, et ils en prennent tout le crédit.${prompt}
  7501: |-
    Avez-vous vu les grandes roues à eau à l'étage !?
    Elles sont incroyables ! Elles envoient de l'énergie à tout l'atelier, vous savez ?${prompt}
  7502: |-
    Tsk, tsk !
    Les ingénieurs de nos jours dépendent trop des machines !
    Eh bien, à mon époque...${prompt}
  7503: |-
    Ka-chink ! Ka-chink !
    J'adore le son des marteaux frappant le métal !
    Je pense que c'est encore mieux que les chansons que jouent les bardes !${prompt}
  7504: Avez-vous déjà rencontré une fille fougueuse portant une grande écharpe ? C'est la fille du président, vous savez. Non, je ne plaisante pas ! On dit aussi qu'ils s'entendaient bien avant qu'il n'accède à son poste actuel.${prompt}
  7505: Mec, j'ai besoin d'une pause...${prompt}
  7506: J'ai faim...non, je veux dire, je suis affamé.${prompt}
  7507: La nourriture ici n'est pas mauvaise, mais un peu plus de variété ne ferait pas de mal, vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?${prompt}
  7508: |-
    Mon ami, Offa, m'a dit que les ${item-plural: 7[2]} sont exquis !
    J'aimerais en avoir un jour.${prompt}
  7509: Il m'a dit qu'il y avait une manière facile mais dangereuse de les fabriquer, mais--hé, en parlant d'Offa, il n'est pas venu travailler récemment...${prompt}
  7510: Hmm, il traîne probablement chez lui dans le quartier des marchés encore une fois.${prompt}
  7511: |-
    Hé ! Est-ce que c'est ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ?
    Laisse-moi l'avoir ! Tiens, je te donne ça !${prompt}
  7512: |-
    Que ce soit la mine, la forge ou l'aventure, c'est toujours pareil.
    Nous, les Galka, faisons tout le sale boulot pendant que les Humes restent assis à regarder.${prompt}
  7513: C'est le bureau du président.${prompt}
  7514: Vous n'avez pas de missions à accomplir ? Si ce n'est pas le cas, allez en chercher une et arrêtez de me déranger.${prompt}
  7515: |-
    Je suis désolé, mon gars, je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
    Reviens plus tard, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7516: |-
    Ah, c'est toi.
    Tu te souviens de ce que je t'ai demandé de faire, non ?${prompt}
  7517: |-
    Ne dérangez pas le chef.
    Chaque seconde qu'il passe loin de ses recherches est une perte pour les Ateliers de Métal.${prompt}
  7518: |-
    C'est le bureau du président.
    N'entrez pas si vous n'avez pas d'affaires officielles.${prompt}
  7519: |-
    Comment vas-tu, aventurier ?
    N'oublie pas, l'expérience est le meilleur enseignant.${prompt}
  7520: Ces canons ne sont plus que des symboles maintenant, et c'est ainsi que cela devrait être.${prompt}
  7521: |-
    Ces portes mènent au bureau du président.
    Seuls ceux qui sont en mission spéciale et les aventuriers de haut rang de Bastok peuvent entrer.${prompt}
  7522: |-
    C'est la Canonnière du Sud.
    Nous pouvons contrôler tous les canons de Bastok à partir d'ici.
    Espérons que nous n'en aurons pas besoin de sitôt.${prompt}
  7523: |-
    Hé, tu n'es pas un gamin. Pourquoi es-tu à la chasse aux tampons ?
    Non, ne me le dis pas, je ne veux pas le savoir. Tiens.${prompt}
  7524: Vous avez reçu un tampon !${prompt}
  7525: |-
    Cette alcôve est notre Temple de la Déesse.
    Peu de gens viennent ici - les habitants de Bastok ne sont pas réputés pour leur piété.${prompt}
  7526: La chasse aux tampons ? Je prends exception à ce que les gens viennent piétiner ce lieu sacré, mais... bon, en fin de compte, en voilà un.${prompt}
  7527: |-
    Cette zone est interdite aux... oh, vous avez apporté le rapport des Mines de Zeruhn.
    Je vais prendre ça.${prompt}
  7528: |-
    C'était votre première mission, n'est-ce pas ? Bon travail.
    Normalement, nous...${prompt}
  7529: Monsieur Lucius ! Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  7530: Naji... vous avez mentionné un rapport ?${prompt}
  7531: |-
    Oui, monsieur ! Cet aventurier vient juste d'apporter le dernier.
    Je comptais tous les apporter plus tard, monsieur.${prompt}
  7532: Montre-le moi.${prompt}
  7533: Alors... de plus en plus de Galka commencent à croire au retour de leur Gardien des Contes.${prompt}
  7534: |-
    Le Gardien des Contes, monsieur ?
    Mais je pensais que c'était juste un mythe Galka, monsieur.${prompt}
  7535: Si seulement c'était vrai... J'ai reçu des rapports selon lesquels le Gardien des Contes est déjà de retour parmi eux.${prompt}
  7536: |-
    Ces rapports... continuez à me les apporter, Naji.
    Nous ne voudrions pas déranger le président avec de telles trivialités.${prompt}
  7537: Oui, monsieur !${prompt}
  7538: Quant à vous, je sais que vous n'êtes pas à Bastok depuis longtemps, alors je vais vous donner un conseil.${prompt}
  7539: |-
    Il n'est ni coutumier ni poli d'ouvrir des documents scellés avant leur livraison.
    Rappelez-vous-en si vous souhaitez rester à Bastok.${prompt}
  7540: |-
    Quant à vous, aventurier, vous avez bien fait.
    Bastok a besoin de plus de gens comme vous.${prompt}
  7541: Waouh ! Peu de gens ont l'occasion de parler à Monsieur Lucius après leur première mission. Il doit voir quelque chose en vous. Continuez ainsi !${prompt}
  7542: |-
    Ouais, que veux-tu ?
    Je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.${prompt}
  7543: |-
    Hein ? Ouais, je suis Cid.
    Oh, tu es ici pour la mission !
    D'accord, je t'attendais.${prompt}
  7544: Hé, Raibaht ! Apporte le bidule par ici.${prompt}
  7545: |-
    Ce n'est que ta deuxième mission, hein ?
    La plupart des jeunes de Bastok n'ont pas le cran de partir à l'aventure, alors je compte sur toi. Fais de ton mieux, tu m'entends ?${prompt}
  7546: |-
    Eh bien, cette mission n'est pas si difficile.
    Tu dois juste sortir...${prompt}
  7547: '... Raibaht, mon vieux, si tu as apporté le truc, ne reste pas là sans rien dire !${prompt}'
  7548: '... J’ai apporté le truc.${prompt}'
  7549: |-
    Gah !
    Si tu ne t'arrêtes pas, je vais commencer à t'appeler "Montagne Silencieuse" ou quelque chose comme ça !${prompt}
  7550: |-
    Tu ne le ferais pas, Chef. Tu n'es pas comme les autres.
    C'est pourquoi je travaille pour toi.${prompt}
  7551: |-
    Pff...
    J'aime bien ce gars – il bosse dur, il est méticuleux dans ses recherches et tout – mais s'il pouvait juste parler un peu plus, tu vois ?${prompt}
  7552: 'Quoi qu’il en soit, voici ce que je veux que tu fasses. Prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} au Wadi Dangruf près de Gustaberg sud.${prompt}'
  7553: |-
    Essaye de trouver un endroit dans le Wadi où ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} change de couleur.
    C'est tout.${prompt}
  7554: À quoi ça sert ? Eh bien, pour que tu comprennes, je devrais te donner des leçons sur les modèles d'accumulation de sédiments dans le Wadi et la formation de poches de gaz dans le sol...${prompt}
  7555: |-
    ...Tu as l'air perdu. Je sais, je sais, tu n'es pas devenu aventurier pour étudier la géologie, pas vrai ?
    Ne t'en fais pas, ce n'est rien de dangereux, alors en avant !${prompt}
  7556: |-
    Ah, te voilà de retour !
    Voyons voir ça. Hmm... rouge, comme je le pensais.
    Et une réaction très forte, en plus.${prompt}
  7557: Alors nous devrions pouvoir l'utiliser... mais nous devons nous assurer de minimiser les répercussions écologiques d'un tel travail...${prompt}
  7558: Toujours aussi occupé, Chef ?${prompt}
  7559: |-
    Volker, le vieux renard !
    Depuis quand es-tu de retour ?${prompt}
  7560: Tout récemment, monsieur. J'avais des affaires dans la Fonderie aujourd'hui, alors je me suis dit que je passerais.${prompt}
  7561: |-
    Tu dois avoir de super histoires à raconter !
    Allez, dis-nous tout !${prompt}
  7562: Chef, est-ce que vous ne parlais pas à cette personne avant que je n'interrompe ?${prompt}
  7563: |-
    Oh, c'est vrai ! Désolé.
    Cela fait longtemps que lui et moi n'avons pas eu l'occasion de parler.${prompt}
  7564: |-
    Permettez-moi de me présenter.
    Je suis Volker, capitaine des Mousquetaires de Mythril.${prompt}
  7565: |-
    Tu dois être un aventurier... et nouveau à Bastok aussi, n'est-ce pas ?
    J'espère que tu te débrouilles bien. Bastok a besoin de bonnes personnes.${prompt}
  7566: |-
    Oui, pour ta deuxième mission, tu t'es très bien débrouillé.
    Je parlerai moi-même au garde de la guérite.${prompt}
  7567: |-
    Bon, je vais y aller.
    Je repasserai plus tard, Chef.${prompt}
  7568: Je dois encore prêter une oreille aux plaintes du président.${prompt}
  7569: |-
    Allons, il a besoin de soutien, surtout de ta part.
    Ça ne se voit peut-être pas, mais je suis sûr qu'il fait de son mieux.${prompt}
  7570: |-
    Désolé de t'avoir retenu aussi longtemps. Merci encore, et bon travail.
    Oh, et j'aurai peut-être besoin de ton aide à nouveau bientôt, alors reste en contact !${prompt}
  7571: 'Ah, on t''a confié l’enquête sur les ${item-plural: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7572: Il y a de nombreux phénomènes étranges associés à cet endroit, comme tu l'as entendu.${prompt}
  7573: J'ai balayé cette zone et j'ai découvert qu'il y a une forte résonance cristalline sur une ligne droite entre cette structure et Jeuno.${prompt}
  7574: Pour l'instant, je l'appelle la "Ligne Cristalline"...${prompt}
  7575: Peu importe, tu as encore cette expression vide sur ton visage. Je vais passer les détails.${prompt}
  7576: |-
    Il y a trois endroits près de la structure où tu peux obtenir ${item-plural: 7[2]}.
    Ce sont des plates-formes surélevées et brillantes appelées "Télépoints".${prompt}
  7577: |-
    Place un cristal sur un Télépoint, et le cristal sera vidé de son énergie.
    Fais cela, et ramène-moi le cristal éteint.${prompt}
  7578: |-
    Oh, une dernière chose.
    Pour placer le cristal sur un Télépoint, utilise "Échanger".${prompt}
  7579: |-
    Bien, tu as ramené ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Comme je le pensais, son motif de détérioration est presque identique à celui trouvé à Beadeaux...${prompt}
  7580: |-
    <Soupir>
    Je ne sais tout simplement pas quoi penser de tous les phénomènes étranges qui se produisent ces derniers temps...${prompt}
  7581: Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés que nous avons découverts récemment...${prompt}
  7582: Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés...${prompt}
  7583: |-
    Hm ? Oh, désolé. Je parlais tout seul.
    Bon boulot. Tu peux... attends, est-ce que je peux te demander de faire quelque chose d'autre pour moi ?${prompt}
  7584: Do you remember Volker? He came here when you were reporting the results of your first mission to me.${prompt}
  7585: It would be best if you could deliver this to him personally, but he's a busy man and hard to find.${prompt}
  7586: Give it to one of his Mythril Musketeers instead. Ayame and Naji should be on guard near the President's Office. Either one will do.${prompt}
  7587: |-
    A letter from the Chief?
    What is it about?${prompt}
  7588: |-
    It's addressed to our captain.
    Let's see... Hmm? Huh? I can't make heads or tails out of this...${prompt}
  7589: |-
    I'm sorry, but could you give it to Ayame instead? She should be on guard at the rear of this building.
    This kind of technical stuff's more her specialty. It's all mumbo-jumbo to me.${prompt}
  7590: Oh, but do me a favor... Don't tell her I asked you to, or she's gonna make fun of me again.${prompt}
  7591: |-
    You have a letter from the Chief Engineer?
    May I see it?${prompt}
  7592: |-
    This is a report on the investigation of the Crystal Line.
    It is addressed to our captain... This might mean our company is moving out soon.${prompt}
  7593: |-
    Thank you for bringing this to me.
    Your presence is very much appreciated. The Chief is a little busy these days to do such chores himself.${prompt}
  7594: |-
    I must ask you one thing, though.
    Why did you bring this to me, and not Naji?
    He is also a Mythril Musketeer, and posted closer to the entrance.${prompt}
  7595: |-
    Why did you bring the letter to Ayame?
    ${selection-lines}
    Naji didn't look smart enough.
    Ayame looked more reliable.
    Because I felt like it.${prompt}
  7596: |-
    Hah hah hah.
    Well, he is always saying, “I'm a fighter, not a thinker!”
    The latter, I may have to agree with.${prompt}
  7597: Thank you for the compliment. Mythril Musketeers are supposed to be reliable, but I wasn't sure if I could fit the role. Well, at least I do a little bit more than Naji.${prompt}
  7598: |-
    You're very perceptive; I like that in an adventurer.
    I guess I'll be seeing you around a lot more.${prompt}
  7599: |-
    Oh. Well, no matter.
    Good work.${prompt}
  7600: |-
    Oooh! You've brought me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
    I just love these cooked--${prompt}
  7601: |-
    Uh...I mean, this is very important to the safety of Bastok, yes!
    It's imperative that you do not tell anyone you've brought this to me!${prompt}
  7602: |-
    You have proven yourself to be a great patriot!
    I will be following your career with great interest.${prompt}
  7603: Senator, sir...you still haven't handed in your orders regarding--${prompt}
  7604: |-
    Iron Eater! Wh-what are you doing here!?
    I am in the middle of a very important--${prompt}
  7605: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} again, sir?${prompt}'
  7606: |-
    How did you know? Uh...I mean, get out!
    It's going to spoil if I don't cook it--${prompt}
  7607: |-
    <Sigh> Bon appetit, sir.
    Just hand in the papers to one of the Musketeers as soon as you're done.${prompt}
  7608: Tell me...do you not sometimes wonder if these missions are truly worth your time?${prompt}
  7609: |-
    Do you think missions are a waste of time?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I do.
    No, I don't.${prompt}
  7610: |-
    Hah hah hah.
    You are an honest one. But it is not something you should say to a Mythril Musketeer, especially when you are near the President's Office.${prompt}
  7611: |-
    I see.
    I must apologize. It is unbecoming of a Mythril Musketeer to ask such questions.${prompt}
  7612: Either way, there is no question that you have done a great deal for the prosperity of Bastok, and that you will in the future as well.${prompt}
  7613: I must try to do the same...${prompt}
  7614: |-
    Good to see you again.
    I hear you're going overseas.${prompt}
  7615: Usually, I would be giving you your orders, but this time, the president's aide wants to meet with you in person.${prompt}
  7616: I don't know if the missions you've been on so far were tough for you...${prompt}
  7617: But this time, I'm sure it's going to be a real challenge.${prompt}
  7618: I mean, you're going to have to go to both San d'Oria and Windurst...${prompt}
  7619: |-
    It's not like going somewhere nearby, like Gustaberg or the Konschtat Highlands.
    You'll have to travel by sea, too.${prompt}
  7620: |-
    This is the President's Room.
    Remember to be polite.${prompt}
  7621: (Oh, and make sure you don't say anything that might offend him... He's really touchy.) ${prompt}
  7622: |-
    Ah, we have been expecting you.
    I remember meeting you after your first mission.
    Let me introduce you. This is Sir Karst--${prompt}
  7623: President Karst. That is how you will address me.${prompt}
  7624: Lucius, what was that about a first mission?${prompt}
  7625: |-
    The report from the Zeruhn Mines, sir.
    About the Talekeeper--${prompt}
  7626: |-
    Hmph. Those Galka again.
    I was not informed you had met with the messenger, Lucius.${prompt}
  7627: I did not feel it was necessary to bother you with such trivial matters, sir.${prompt}
  7628: “President,” Lucius.${prompt}
  7629: My apologies. I am sorry for not having informed you about the Galka, Mister President.${prompt}
  7630: |-
    No matter.
    Here are your orders.${prompt}
  7631: |-
    As you know, there are three other nations aside from our own in Vana'diel.
    The Kingdom of San d'Oria, the Federation of Windurst, and the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.${prompt}
  7632: Jeuno is still professing neutrality, so I want you to go to San d'Oria and Windurst.${prompt}
  7633: It does not matter which you go to first, as long as you go to both. I will give you a letter of introduction, which you will present to the consuls in both nations. Any questions?${prompt}
  7634: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    What do I do once I get there?
    Why am I being sent?
    How do I get to San d'Oria?
    How do I get to Windurst?
    Where are the consulates?
    Why did you call me here?
    No questions.${prompt}
  7635: "The consuls in each country will tell you.\nDon't worry, we are not asking you to spy--the jobs you will be given will benefit those countries as much as ours.${prompt} "
  7636: |-
    Why? Officially, to promote friendship between our nations.
    In reality, to investigate the internal state of those countries, and also to train you.${prompt}
  7637: San d'Oria is in Northern Quon, the same continent as Bastok. You can get there by land.${prompt}
  7638: Go to the port town of Selbina to the northwest. Once there, you can take a ship to Mhaura, a small town that is a stone's throw away from Windurst.${prompt}
  7639: |-
    Ask someone else if you want details.
    I'm the president, not a travel agent.${prompt}
  7640: |-
    And you call yourself an adventurer!?
    Just ask the guards of the country you're in!${prompt}
  7641: |-
    I do not trust my subordinates, so I prefer to give the most important orders myself.
    That is all you need to know.${prompt}
  7642: Any other questions?${prompt}
  7643: |-
    Good.
    Lucius, the letter.${prompt}
  7644: |-
    This is your letter of introduction.
    Present it to the consuls and they will give you further instructions.${prompt}
  7645: |-
    Those are your orders. Depart quickly.
    You are dismissed.${prompt}
  7646: |-
    So, how did it go?
    Did the president nag at you?${prompt}
  7647: I still can't believe that Chief Cid actually backed that guy during the elections...${prompt}
  7648: |-
    Oops. You didn't hear me say that, okay?
    I gotta go. Good luck on your mission!${prompt}
  7649: |-
    Wow! You've been to San d'Oria and Windurst already?
    Let me escort you to the President's Office.${prompt}
  7650: |-
    So, how was it?
    Did the Orcs in Ghelsba or the Yagudo in Giddeus give you any trouble?${prompt}
  7651: Man, I envy you. I'm a Mythril Musketeer, but all they make me do is stand guard at that door.${prompt}
  7652: Captain Volker and Iron Eater get all the good missions, and Ayame always puts me down...${prompt}
  7653: |-
    I'm a Mythril Musketeer, the cream of the crop!
    Why do I have to do guard duty? It's just not fair...${prompt}
  7654: Then perhaps I should order you to sweep the Quadav from Palborough...single-handedly.${prompt}
  7655: M-Mister President!${prompt}
  7656: |-
    Go back to your post, Naji.
    That is an order.${prompt}
  7657: Report. What have you learned of Windurst and San d'Oria?${prompt}
  7658: |-
    What do you report?
    ${selection-lines}
    The details of your trip.
    The internal state of San d'Oria.
    The internal state of Windurst.
    The state of the Kindred.${prompt}
  7659: |-
    Oh, did you have a pleasant trip, then?
    Bah! Do you mock me, adventurer? Tell me of the other nations, now!${prompt}
  7660: |-
    Hmph. So they are still trapped in their foolish traditions.
    They are no better than the Orcs they fight with.${prompt}
  7661: Hmph. Then it would be foolish to expect any help from those cowards in fighting the beastmen...${prompt}
  7662: You mean that someone is leading the beastman hordes, then?${prompt}
  7663: |-
    Lucius. Speak with Volker about this, and come back when you have a plan to deal with this situation.
    And do not forget to watch the Quadav.${prompt}
  7664: Do you have anything else to report?${prompt}
  7665: |-
    I have spared you all the time I can.
    Lucius, stay and see what sense you can make of this--and do spare me all the trivial details when you report to me.${prompt}
  7666: Tell me more of what you have learned about the beastmen, please.${prompt}
  7667: |-
    I see... It does seem like there is someone controlling their movements.
    But who could be powerful enough to unite those unruly hordes...?${prompt}
  7668: |-
    Good work.
    We will probably ask you to undertake another important mission in a few days.${prompt}
  7669: Le président, malgré ses paroles dures, vous estime beaucoup et s'attend à ce que vous réussissiez. Tout comme moi.${prompt}
  7670: |-
    Ah, vous êtes ici pour une mission, n'est-ce pas ?
    Nous vous attendions.
    C'est bon de vous voir arriver ici sain et sauf.${prompt}
  7671: Riault, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7672: |-
    Oui, madame.
    Tout d'abord, laissez-moi vous parler de l'état actuel de Bastok.${prompt}
  7673: |-
    Bastok a déjà perdu plusieurs atouts majeurs face aux Quadavs.
    Les mines de Palborough ont été la perte la plus importante.${prompt}
  7674: |-
    Leur situation récente est similaire à la nôtre dans notre lutte contre les Orcs.
    Seule l'époque précédant la Grande Guerre a vu un tel changement de pouvoir.${prompt}
  7675: |-
    J'ai entendu une rumeur selon laquelle ils se rallieraient derrière un nouveau leader !
    Pouvez-vous le croire ? Des bêtes organisées !?${prompt}
  7676: |-
    Cela présage mal, je vous le dis.
    Et ce qui est pire, c'est que nous sommes coincés ici dans cette ville de voyous incultes !${prompt}
  7677: |-
    Chantain ! Cela suffit.
    Riault, veuillez continuer.${prompt}
  7678: Votre mission est d'aller aux mines de Palborough, actuellement sous le contrôle des Quadavs, et de prendre un échantillon de la ressource décroissante appelée mythril.${prompt}
  7679: 'Pour être précis, nous avons besoin que vous rameniez ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7680: Grâce à notre accord de coopération mutuelle, Bastok nous permet de vous envoyer dans les mines. Votre véritable objectif est de recueillir autant d'informations que possible sur la technologie avancée de Bastok.${prompt}
  7681: Nous devons découvrir qui ou quoi rassemble les bêtes, tout en donnant l'impression que nous coopérons avec Bastok.${prompt}
  7682: C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin que vous alliez enquêter sur les mines de Palborough. Elles étaient autrefois la propriété de Bastok... mais de nos jours, aucun Bastokien sensé ne s'approcherait à moins d'un malm de là, s'il avait le choix.${prompt}
  7683: Si cela dépendait de nous, nous voudrions que vous alliez aux mines immédiatement, mais les autorités de Bastok nous ont dit que vous deviez d'abord vous rendre auprès d'eux pour obtenir une autorisation.${prompt}
  7684: Je sais que vous préféreriez vous passer de toute cette paperasserie, mais supportez-nous et rendez-vous auprès du responsable de Bastok nommé Pius. Vous le trouverez dans le bureau du président.${prompt}
  7685: Je dois vous avertir que nous pensions que les Humes étaient un peuple raisonnable avant de venir ici... mais nous avons découvert que ce n'est pas toujours le cas.${prompt}
  7686: |-
    Leur talent pour faire des profits est incomparable, mais leur sens du devoir laisse quelque peu à désirer.
    En fait, même leurs fonctionnaires peuvent poser problème. Pour le succès de votre mission, essayez d'être patient.${prompt}
  7687: |-
    Ah, vous avez apporté le ${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Bon travail.${prompt}
  7688: |-
    Je vais demander à Riault de rédiger un résumé des informations que nous avons pu rassembler sur la technologie bastokienne.
    Riault, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7689: |-
    Ah, vous êtes revenu. Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
    Hmm... je vois. Je suis content que vous soyez revenu sain et sauf.${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Riault prendra note des détails de votre enquête.
    Veuillez lui dire ce que vous avez vu.${prompt}
  7691: |-
    <Soupire>
    Quand pourrons-nous revenir à San d'Oria, je me demande.${prompt}
  7692: |-
    J'en ai assez de ces Humes grossiers et de ces Galka sauvages.
    Je veux partir !${prompt}
  7693: |-
    Je comprends ce que tu veux dire.
    Même leurs techniques architecturales sont rudimentaires. C'est un miracle que ces bâtiments tiennent encore debout !${prompt}
  7694: Ne devrais-je pas vous rappeler que cette nation "grossière et sauvage" rivalise avec San d'Oria pour le pouvoir sur ce continent ?${prompt}
  7695: San d'Oria ne peut guère se permettre de se reposer sur ses gloires passées. Notre complaisance et notre arrogance seront notre perte.${prompt}
  7696: N'était-ce pas ce genre de discours qui vous a envoyé ici en premier lieu, peu importe que vous soyez de noble lignée ?${prompt}
  7697: Oui, vous devriez faire attention. Comme disait mon grand-père, "Si tu n'as rien de gentil à dire, ne dis rien du tout."${prompt}
  7698: |-
    Oh, tu devrais parler, Chantain.
    Riault, n'est-il pas temps que tu aies fini ?${prompt}
  7699: |-
    Tout est terminé, madame.
    Cela conclut la partie concernant Bastok de cette mission.${prompt}
  7700: |-
    Vous vous rendez ensuite à Windurst, n'est-ce pas ?
    Faites comme vous avez fait ici. Rendez-vous au consulat, et ils s'occuperont de vous.${prompt}
  7701: Gloire à San d'Oria, et que vous marchiez avec honneur.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Votre mission est presque terminée.
    Il vous suffit de retourner à San d'Oria avec votre rapport.${prompt}
  7703: Oh, vous êtes l'aventurier avec la lettre d'introduction, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7704: |-
    C'est bien de votre part d'être venu.
    Ça a dû être un long voyage, monter sur un bateau pour un endroit lointain comme celui-ci.${prompt}
  7705: J'ai étudié dur pour devenir consul, espérant être servi par des secrétaires mignonnes, mais mon destin a été d'être délégué dans ce coin perdu...${prompt}
  7706: |-
    Oh ! Je suis désolé !
    Ne dites à personne que j'ai dit ça, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
  7707: Je veux dire, vous ne pouvez pas me blâmer - je suis entouré de Humes musclés et de Galkas effrayants au lieu de mignon... vous savez.${prompt}
  7708: |-
    Oh, Mih Ketto ?
    Nous avons un invité ici. Ne devrais-tu pas servir du thé ?${prompt}
  7709: Quel thé ? Nous sommes à court de thé depuis des mois !${prompt}
  7710: |-
    Alors pourquoi n'avez-vous pas rempli notre stock ?
    Combien de fois je vous l'ai dit...${prompt}
  7711: |-
    Uh... monsieur ?
    Voulez-vous que j'aille en acheter ?${prompt}
  7712: |-
    Hmm, eh bien...
    Maintenant que vous en parlez, je ne me rappelle pas avoir vu quelqu'un vendre du thé ici...${prompt}
  7713: Hmm ? Vous vous moquez du thé, dites-vous ? Vous voulez entendre parler de la mission ? Oh, zut...${prompt}
  7714: Je suis désolé, faire plaisir aux gens... Je veux dire, essayer de rendre les gens heureux, est devenu une habitude. Cela fait partie du travail.${prompt}
  7715: |-
    Anyway, here's what you have to do...
    Uh... That is... Let's see...${prompt}
  7716: Topuru-Kuperu! What was it we were supposed to ask?${prompt}
  7717: |-
    Huh? What?
    Did you call me, sir?${prompt}
  7718: |-
    Oh! There you are!
    You were making yourself so small I didn't see you!${prompt}
  7719: |-
    The mission, man, the mission!
    You know, for the adventurer from Windurst!${prompt}
  7720: I know how homesick you are, but I expect you to do your share while you're here!${prompt}
  7721: Uh...I think it had...something to do with going to the Palborough Mines, sir...${prompt}
  7722: |-
    Oh...I remember now.
    We need some refined ore.${prompt}
  7723: |-
    What? Is that really something we should be asking a great adventurer from Windurst to do?
    And the Palborough Mines are infested with Quadav, too!${prompt}
  7724: Beg your pardon, sir, but...I think it's our pretext for studying Bastokan technology, sir...${prompt}
  7725: Oh, I remember now. The Quadav are acting strangely, so the adventurer is to go to the Palborough Mines to investigate.${prompt}
  7726: |-
    That's very-wary vague... And aren't the Palborough Mines overrun by the Quadav?
    Isn't that dangerous?${prompt}
  7727: Well, reports from Windurst say that beastmen of different types all seem to be exhibiting the same type of organized behavior... That is what we need to investigate, sir.${prompt}
  7728: But first, the adventurer is to meet with Sir Pius in the President's Office...${prompt}
  7729: Ah, yes! Pius--Sir Pius. I think we've had dinner once...or perhaps it was brunch?${prompt}
  7730: |-
    No matter. To work, then!
    Good luck! Come back when you're done!${prompt}
  7731: |-
    Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
    Good job! Good job!
    Tell Topuru-Kuperu what you've seen.${prompt}
  7732: 'We''ll return this ${item-singular: 7[2]} to the government of Bastok after we''ve studied it.${prompt}'
  7733: |-
    So you were able to enter a beastman-infested area, perform your mission, and still manage to come back in one piece. Extaruordinary!
    Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt}
  7734: |-
    Ah, welcome back!
    I see you're still in one piece!${prompt}
  7735: |-
    Topuru-Kuperu will write down your report.
    Tell him what you've seen!${prompt}
  7736: |-
    Oh, my! Is that true!?
    Oh, my! Oh, my!${prompt}
  7737: |-
    It's simply amazing that you could run into such a monster, and not be pounded into adventurer soup!
    Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt}
  7738: |-
    What?
    Oh, right. I guess so, sir.${prompt}
  7739: |-
    Oh, let me guess--you were thinking about Windurst again, weren't you?
    Snap out of it, man! You have work to do!${prompt}
  7740: <Sigh> Windurst...${prompt}
  7741: |-
    Well, you can't say I didn't try.
    Ah--but you will report that all of us are working exceptionally hard here, yes?${prompt}
  7742: |-
    You're off to San d'Oria now, aren't you?
    Have a safe and pleasant trip!${prompt}
  7743: |-
    Since you've visited both San d'Oria and Bastok, you may now make your triumphant return to Windurst!
    Oh, and tell everyone we said hi!${prompt}
  7744: |-
    Oui, que puis-je faire pour vous ?
    Ah, vous êtes l'envoyé de ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst].${prompt}
  7745: |-
    Allez parler à un Galka nommé Grohm - il faisait partie de l'expédition qui a tenté de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav par le passé.
    Il devrait être dans le Craftsmen's Eatery dans le Metalworks.${prompt}
  7746: |-
    Pourquoi êtes-vous toujours là ?
    Les Mousquetaires sont généralement chargés de donner des missions, et franchement, je trouve ce genre de travail fastidieux...${prompt}
  7747: |-
    Mais étant donné que vous êtes un envoyé, vous êtes sous ma juridiction.
    Néanmoins, je ne peux m'empêcher de me demander quels sont les véritables motivations des ${choice: 0}[San d'Oriens/Windurstiens]...${prompt}
  7748: Puis encore, vous vous rendez volontairement dans cet endroit infesté de Quadav, alors je ne peux pas me plaindre, même si vous vous avérez être un espion.${prompt}
  7749: |-
    Quoi qu'il en soit... Vous voulez parler à Grohm, dans le Craftsmen's Eatery du Metalworks.
    Bonne chance.${prompt}
  7750: |-
    Oh, et lorsque vous aurez terminé votre enquête, rapportez directement à votre consulat.
    C'est notre protocole. Je serais plutôt contrarié si vous reveniez ici.${prompt}
  7751: |-
    Hm ? Que voulez-vous ?
    Hé, vous n'êtes pas de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7752: 'Quoi !? Vous êtes ${choice: 0}[San d’Orien/Windurstien], et vous avez écouté ce qu’un officiel de Bastok vous a dit de faire ?${prompt}'
  7753: Hah ! Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce Hume vous a envoyé ici... ou pourquoi votre consulat vous a envoyé chez lui en premier lieu.${prompt}
  7754: Vous feriez mieux d'écouter attentivement. Beaucoup d'entre nous sont morts en essayant de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav...${prompt}
  7755: Cela pourrait ne pas importuner un étranger comme vous, mais ils nous envoient toujours, nous les Galka, faire le sale boulot !${prompt}
  7756: |-
    Ce qui m'agace le plus, c'est qu'ils n'y réfléchissent même pas à deux fois !
    Même si vous n'êtes pas ici depuis longtemps, vous avez dû voir comment ils nous traitent.${prompt}
  7757: |-
    Peu importe. Vous crier dessus ne changera rien.
    Vous vouliez savoir comment raffiner le minerai, n'est-ce pas ? C'est simple, mais vous devez vous souvenir des étapes.${prompt}
  7758: |-
    Voici comment faire :
    1. Obtenez ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.
    2. Mettez-le dans la partie supérieure du raffineur.
    3. Retirez ${article} ${item-singular: 7[2]} de la partie inférieure du raffineur.${prompt}
  7759: 'Vous pouvez soit acheter ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} à quelqu’un, soit en obtenir en utilisant ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} sur une veine de mythril à l’intérieur de Palborough.${prompt}'
  7760: |-
    La machine de raffinage est si grande que ses parties supérieure et inférieure se trouvent à différents étages.
    Mettez ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} dedans au troisième étage, et elle produira ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} au deuxième étage.${prompt}
  7761: Je sais que ça a l'air simple, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Vous avez les Quadav à gérer, et ils sont partout.${prompt}
  7762: |-
    Tiens, prends ces ${item-plural: 5[2]}.
    Bonne chance. Vous en aurez besoin.${prompt}
  7763: Hé, vous êtes un aventurier, non ? D'un autre pays ?${prompt}
  7764: |-
    Désolé, je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher d'écouter aux portes.
    Je vais aussi aux Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
  7765: |-
    Ne t'inquiète pas, je ne vais pas te gêner.
    Je ne pense pas que nous recherchons la même chose de toute façon.${prompt}
  7766: Du moins, pour l'instant.${prompt}
  7767: Mais tu ne devrais pas penser que ta mission se résume à une simple étude de mine.${prompt}
  7768: Les bêtes semblent avoir trouvé un nouveau leader, et les Quadav deviennent plus puissants de jour en jour. Il pourrait y avoir une autre guerre...${prompt}
  7769: Oh, il y a une chose que tu devrais savoir. Sais-tu pourquoi les Quadav ont pris les Mines de Palborough ?${prompt}
  7770: Les Humes prétendent que les Quadav leur ont volé les mines, mais en réalité, les mines sont le foyer des Quadav... non, leur terre sainte.${prompt}
  7771: Les Quadav préféreraient mourir plutôt que de la perdre. Mais les Humes de Bastok ne le savent pas, et ils ne veulent pas  le savoir.${prompt}
  7772: Eh bien, il est temps pour moi d'y aller. Oh, et mon nom est Lion. Je suis un aventurier, comme toi. On se reverra.${prompt}
  7773: |-
    Peu importe, te crier dessus ne changera rien.
    Tu voulais en savoir plus sur les bêtes, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7774: J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles ces Quadav stupides agissent de manière organisée.${prompt}
  7775: On dit même qu'ils ont un chef maintenant, comme pendant la Grande Guerre...${prompt}
  7776: Oh, et il y a un étrange cercle magique au fond des Mines de Palborough. On dit que quiconque le franchit ne revient jamais.${prompt}
  7777: |-
    Ça sonne vraiment suspect, n'est-ce pas ?
    Je suis sûr que tu trouveras tes réponses là-bas.${prompt}
  7778: |-
    Moi ? Oh non. Je n'y retournerai jamais.
    Bonne chance. Tu en auras besoin !${prompt}
  7779: Ah, tu dois être l'aventurier qui va nous rejoindre pour notre mission. J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.${prompt}
  7780: Nous aimerions tenir un briefing bientôt. Vous aurez le temps de vous préparer pour la mission par la suite, mais le briefing pourrait prendre un peu de temps. Êtes-vous prêt maintenant ?${prompt}
  7781: |-
    Quand souhaitez-vous être informé ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tout de suite.
    Plus tard.${prompt}
  7782: Bien. Suivez-moi.${prompt}
  7783: |-
    Attendez, Milady !
    Où allez-vous ?${prompt}
  7784: |-
    Oh, salut !
    Ne faites pas attention à moi, je vais juste au district des mines !${prompt}
  7785: Encore ? Nous, les Mousquetaires du Mythril, ne pouvons pas vous escorter à chaque fois que vous décidez de partir en excursion...${prompt}
  7786: |-
    Je sais, c'est pourquoi j'y vais seule ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, je serai bien !
    Au revoir !${prompt}
  7787: |-
    Non, attends --
    Zut !${prompt}
  7788: Hé, où va-t-elle ?${prompt}
  7789: |-
    "Où va-t-elle" !?
    Vous, Monsieur, étiez chargé de l'arrêter !${prompt}
  7790: Mais... mais...${prompt}
  7791: Pas de réplique aux Mousquetaires seniors, Naji -- ou devrais-je vous appeler "Numéro Cinq" ?${prompt}
  7792: Urgh...${prompt}
  7793: Allez, montez !${prompt}
  7794: |-
    Merci à tous d'être venus si rapidement.
    Voici votre mission : Vous devez monter une attaque sur le bastion Quadav à Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7795: |-
    Soyez prévenus que cela ne sera qu'une frappe limitée.
    Vos principaux objectifs sont de coordonner les tactiques avec des aventuriers expérimentés et de vous familiariser avec le terrain local.${prompt}
  7796: Comme vous pouvez le constater, certains de nos bons amis aventuriers ont accepté de se joindre aux Mousquetaires pour cette opération.${prompt}
  7797: Le Numéro Quatre, Ayame, a planifié cette opération, elle sera donc en charge.${prompt}
  7798: |-
    Le Numéro Cinq, Naji, l'assistera.
    Vous devez tous suivre leurs ordres pendant l'opération.
    Ayame, je vous prie ?${prompt}
  7799: |-
    Tout d'abord, nous devons nous retrouver à Beadeaux, près de l'entrée du bastion Quadav.
    Vos cibles sont les Quadav de cuivre en charge de la défense périmétrique.${prompt}
  7800: |-
    Chacun de vous doit vaincre vingt Quadav de cuivre.
    Une fois cet objectif accompli, vous devez vous disperser et battre en retraite, puis vous regrouper à nouveau à l'entrée.${prompt}
  7801: |-
    N'oubliez pas, le point de rendez-vous est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux !
    Personne ne se perdra, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7802: Tu ferais mieux de te taire. Tu te perdrais même dans ta propre Maison Mog.${prompt} 
  7803: |-
    Dès que vous êtes prêts, ne perdez pas de temps pour vous rendre au point de rendez-vous.
    Renvoyés.${prompt}
  7804: Le chemin vers le point de rendez-vous passe par les marais de Pashhow. Il est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7805: |-
    Traversez les marais de Pashhow pour atteindre le point de rendez-vous.
    C'est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux. Assurez-vous d'avoir tout ce dont vous avez besoin !${prompt}
  7806: |-
    Le point de rendez-vous est à travers les marais de Pashhow, et juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.
    Soyez prêts à tout.${prompt}
  7807: Ah, vous êtes là. Bien.${prompt}
  7808: Vous avez sûrement déjà entendu cela, mais nous avons besoin de quelqu'un de fiable pour prendre en charge les missions centrées autour de notre ambassade à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7809: J'ai parlé tant au président qu'au Capitaine Volker, et c'est notre avis unanime que vous êtes la seule personne adéquate pour la tâche.${prompt}
  7810: Nous vous remettrons une lettre d'introduction, que vous présenterez à notre ambassade à Jeuno pour recevoir de plus amples instructions.${prompt}
  7811: Hans, la lettre.${prompt}
  7812: Oui, monsieur. La voici.${prompt}
  7813: |-
    Bonne chance.
    Je compte sur vous.${prompt}
  7814: |-
    You're back from Jeuno.
    No time to chat. Come with me.${prompt}
  7815: You say someone snuck a familiar into the President's Office, but you were not warned of its presence?${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Yes, sir. We were taken by surprise.
    I did not think anything like this was possible...${prompt}
  7817: Sir Lucius did send me a report stating that our magical defenses were inadequate, but I didn't think that they would be so easy to break...${prompt}
  7818: '...${prompt}'
  7819: Father!?${prompt}
  7820: Cornelia...${prompt}
  7821: |-
    Uncle Cid!
    Where's Father?${prompt}
  7822: |-
    Calm down, Cornelia.
    We have the situation under control.${prompt}
  7823: |-
    Is Father...?
    Please, tell me it's not true...!${prompt}
  7824: |-
    Hmph.
    Don't make a scene. I'm not dead yet.${prompt}
  7825: Father!${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Cornelia, this does not concern you.
    Go to your room.${prompt}
  7827: Lucius, explain what happened.${prompt}
  7828: The familiar used magic to infiltrate the building...then it proceeded to cross the office straight toward the president's private chambers.${prompt}
  7829: Fortunately, the president was awake at the time, and was not injured...${prompt}
  7830: But they took the talisman.${prompt}
  7831: |-
    The talisman!?
    The key to the Shadow Lord's seal!?${prompt}
  7832: Twenty years ago, our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord in the Northlands and sealed him away from our world. Chief Cid and Captain Volker were there, I believe.${prompt}
  7833: |-
    The three parts of the key to the seal, the talismans, were given to each nation's leader for safekeeping.
    But now, at least one of them is gone...${prompt}
  7834: Who would do such a thing?${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Have you not found the culprit yet?
    Granted, there are many who bear ill feelings towards me...${prompt}
  7836: But then again, those fools in the Senate are too busy squabbling with each other, and the Galka rebels are too savage to possess any magic skills...${prompt}
  7837: '...${prompt}'
  7838: Father! Don't talk about the Galka that way!${prompt}
  7839: |-
    Why are you still here?
    Did I not tell you to go to your room?${prompt}
  7840: '...${prompt}'
  7841: From the reports we have received from the other nations, we must assume that the Kindred are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.${prompt}
  7842: Then we must go to the Northlands to investigate!${prompt}
  7843: The Senate would have to approve before I can let the Mythril Musketeers go so far away from the city.${prompt}
  7844: |-
    It would take too much time, and time is a luxury we cannot afford.
    Besides, the Senate has no sense of crisis--they would just reject my proposal.${prompt}
  7845: Then...${prompt}
  7846: We have to find someone with no legal constraints.${prompt}
  7847: I am assigning you a mission, adventurer, and putting you under the Musketeers' jurisdiction.${prompt}
  7848: You do not have to answer right away, but do you accept?${prompt}
  7849: |-
    Accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    I need some time.${prompt}
  7850: |-
    Then let us talk in private.
    Volker, come with us.${prompt}
  7851: |-
    Very well.
    Talk to the guard in charge of missions when you feel you are ready.${prompt}
  7852: |-
    I hear you accepted the mission.
    Come with me.${prompt}
  7853: |-
    First, let me tell you about your destination.
    You are to journey to the cursed Northlands, to the ruins of Fei'Yin. You will find the ruins at the northeastern corner of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt}
  7854: The city of Fei'Yin was built in ancient times by a civilization far more advanced than ours.${prompt}
  7855: |-
    We believe they called themselves the Zilart.
    There are many other ruins in Vana'diel thought to be of their making.${prompt}
  7856: |-
    Considering how long ago they were built, their state of preservation is astounding.
    It is as if they are protected by some unseen force that defies time itself.${prompt}
  7857: Thirty years ago, a multinational team was sent to the Northlands to try to uncover the secrets of the Zilart's power.${prompt}
  7858: Ulrich, Volker's uncle--and the captain of the Mythril Musketeers at the time--led the Bastokan contingent of that expedition.${prompt}
  7859: Unfortunately, they came back empty-handed.${prompt}
  7860: '...${prompt}'
  7861: |-
    Captain Volker will tell you the way to your destination.
    He undertook the same journey twenty years ago, near the end of the Great War.${prompt}
  7862: Even before the war, Fei'Yin was overrun with fiends. We captured it from the Shadow Lord at the cost of many lives.${prompt}
  7863: |-
    After the war, we set seals on both sides of the border to keep the Shadow Lord's minions at bay.
    One seal in the ruined coliseum on the inside, and another in Fei'Yin on the outside.${prompt}
  7864: That was twenty years ago. In those days, we could reach the Beaucedine Glacier from East Ronfaure through Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  7865: |-
    That is still the only way there, but I believe San d'Oria is guarding that road now.
    You will have to find some way through.${prompt}
  7866: |-
    Your objective is to ascertain that the seal in Fei'Yin is still intact.
    If it is not, replace it with the one we will be providing you.${prompt}
  7867: You do have an airship pass, do you not?${prompt}
  7868: |-
    Head to Jeuno, and take the flight to San d'Oria as soon as possible.
    You are dismissed.${prompt}
  7869: |-
    Whoa! You made it back from Fei'Yin in one piece!
    Come with me, quick!${prompt}
  7870: So...the seal in Fei'Yin was also broken.${prompt}
  7871: |-
    Where were the San d'Orians!?
    It was their duty to protect it!${prompt}
  7872: |-
    Mister President?
    Should we ask the Senate about an incursion to Zvahl?${prompt}
  7873: |-
    We seem to have no other choice.
    But until they come to a decision, our hands are tied.${prompt}
  7874: |-
    We would like you to stand by for further orders.
    We have preparations to make.${prompt}
  7875: |-
    I heard you mention meeting a Galka dressed all in black in Fei'Yin.
    Tell me more about him.${prompt}
  7876: |-
    As I thought...it is Zeid.
    Then he has been tracking the Kindred ever since he disappeared twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7877: |-
    He was the Number Two Mythril Musketeer--the Galka named “War Cloud.”
    Ah...but he never liked being called by his Hume-given name.${prompt}
  7878: He is the one who defeated the Shadow Lord... He should have been Captain, not I.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    Still, why has he been hiding from us?
    What is there in the Northlands that would change Zeid, and even my uncle, so much?${prompt}
  7880: Ah, I apologize. It is not my place to ask these questions. I am but a Musketeer, a humble soldier of Bastok.${prompt}
  7881: |-
    Huh? No, this isn't the Blacksmiths' Guild.
    That's to the northwest.${prompt}
  7882: |-
    Hey, you're an adventurer, right?
    I need ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} for one of my experiments.${prompt}
  7883: |-
    Can you get me some?
    I've heard they appear during dust storms...${prompt}
  7884: Go ask Drangord the Galka. He said he found some during his adventuring years.${prompt}
  7885: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}! Thanks, this will help me with my experiments!
    But I can always use more if you happen to come upon additional quantities.${prompt}
  7886: Hmm...this machine's been acting up lately. I wonder if the oil's gone bad...${prompt}
  7887: |-
    This machine needs oiling, but we're all out of machine oil.
    What could I use as a substitute, I wonder?${prompt}
  7888: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
    Thank you. Here, take this as payment.${prompt}
  7889: |-
    My job's not that bad, really.
    Working with machines beats working in the mines any day.${prompt}
  7890: Designing new products isn't easy. I don't know how Chief Cid does it, coming up with new inventions almost every week.${prompt}
  7891: To be honest, it's not always easy working with Humes, but you get used to it. You have to.${prompt}
  7892: |-
    You've got to be flexible, you know? You gotta keep up with the times.
    Otherwise you'll end up in the mines with the rest of the old, hard-headed Galka.${prompt}
  7893: |-
    This is the Darksteel Forge.
    You must've heard of darksteel before.${prompt}
  7894: |-
    Darksteel is an alloy harder yet more flexible than regular steel. What's more, it neither stains nor rusts.
    The only drawback is that it's a little heavy.${prompt}
  7895: Its formula was a Galkan secret for a long time, but lately we've decided to teach Humes how to make it, too.${prompt}
  7896: Knowing Humes, though, they would've figured it out eventually, and come up with something better.${prompt}
  7897: |-
    Can I help you? This is the Cermet Refinery.
    Normally, only factory workers are allowed in, but...${prompt}
  7898: |-
    Well, I guess you're okay.
    Do you know what cermet is? It's an alloy that's harder and lighter than steel, doesn't rust, and can withstand extreme heat. Amazing, isn't it?${prompt}
  7899: |-
    It's the byproduct of recent breakthroughs in alchemy.
    Thanks to cermet, Chief Cid's engine designs are now years ahead of their time!${prompt}
  7900: |-
    In fact, cermet...ah, no, I can't tell you any more.
    Just that...if we manage to find a way to cut down its production cost, we can put those Galka smiths on the spot!${prompt}
  7901: |-
    This is the Cermet Refinery.
    The factory is off-limits to unauthorized personnel.${prompt}
  7902: Then again, even if those anachronistic San d'Orians did manage to get in, they probably wouldn't be able to make heads or tails out of our instruments!${prompt}
  7903: The younger Galka who work here answer to their Hume-given names, like pets to their master! Have they no shame!?${prompt}
  7904: |-
    It is all because of the loss of our Talekeeper.
    If only Sir Raogrimm were here...${prompt}
  7905: |-
    I've heard good things about you. It seems you're quite the adventurer now.
    I have a job for you.${prompt}
  7906: It's...well, it's not a mission, or anything official. Just a personal favor.${prompt}
  7907: |-
    There's a tavern in the Port District called the Steaming Sheep Restaurant.
    I want you to go see if the matron there needs any help.${prompt}
  7908: |-
    And if she does, could you try to help her?
    Of course, I will reward you for your services.${prompt}
  7909: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]}, huh?
    I think a certain crawler in the Crawlers' Nest drops them. Of course, you'll have to lure it out and defeat it first.${prompt}
  7910: 'And to lure it out, you''ll need to use ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.${prompt}'
  7911: A letter?${prompt}
  7912: '...${prompt}'
  7913: |-
    I-I see. Ms. Hilda said that, huh?
    But I didn't mean to--no, never mind.
    You've done what I asked. I'll give you a reward.${prompt}
  7914: |-
    But please, don't tell anyone about this.
    Especially not Raibaht.${prompt}
  7915: Did you say something, Chief?${prompt}
  7916: Gah! Don't waste time talking! Get back to work!${prompt}
  7917: |-
    An invitation from the Steaming Sheep? Hmm... Please do not mention this to the Chief.
    But tell the proprietor I will go visit her establishment as soon as I can.${prompt}
  7918: |-
    Good of you to come.
    The reason why I didn't have Naji or Iron Eater bring you here is because the secrecy of this mission is paramount.${prompt}
  7919: |-
    Volker will soon join us.
    Let us talk in my private chambers.
    Come.${prompt}
  7920: Galina, tell Volker to come to my private chambers when he arrives.${prompt}
  7921: |-
    We could not get the Senate's approval. The Musketeers won't be allowed to leave the city gates.
    Those fools think that Bastok should not get itself involved...${prompt}
  7922: “Let San d'Oria deal with the Northlands,” they said! What do they think the Musketeers are for!? Surely they don't intend to use them in another war with San d'Oria!${prompt}
  7923: I admit that Bastok would do anything for its own gain. That is how we have come so far--myself as well.${prompt}
  7924: Bastok's success is a result of aggression and initiative. But with the Senate dawdling so, we may pay dearly for our lack of action.${prompt}
  7925: |-
    Remember one thing: you are an adventurer, not a hero.
    You have no duty to the majority--especially one that chooses to stay idle at a time like this.${prompt}
  7926: |-
    Go on this mission for your own gain. That is the Bastokan way.
    Do not concern yourself with responsibility--let a certain president and a Musketeer captain worry about that.${prompt}
  7927: |-
    Volker.
    Come.${prompt}
  7928: |-
    Tell the adventurer what you know of Castle Zvahl.
    We do not have much time. Be brief.${prompt}
  7929: Cross the Beaucedine Glacier to the northernmost corner of Quon, the frozen land of Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7930: |-
    There you will find Castle Zvahl, the Kindred's stronghold.
    That is where our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord twenty years ago.${prompt}
  7931: |-
    But now, someone is trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.
    We must stop them, no matter what the cost.${prompt}
  7932: If you are too late, and they succeed...you and your friends must try to defeat the Shadow Lord yourselves, as Cid, Zeid, and I once did.${prompt}
  7933: |-
    You adventurers hold the future of Vana'diel in your hands.
    We cannot accompany you, but our hopes and hearts go with you.${prompt}
  7934: |-
    Go finish your preparations and leave as soon as possible.
    You are dismissed.${prompt}
  7935: Wait... If you see Zeid, tell him that he has yet to best me in a fight...and that he should come back and challenge me.${prompt}
  7936: |-
    You've done it!
    You stopped them from bringing back the Shadow Lord!?${prompt}
  7937: |-
    What are you talking about, Volker?
    They probably defeated him and sent him back where he belongs!
    Am I right?${prompt}
  7938: Quoi ? Le vaincre ? Mais c'est...${prompt}
  7939: Impossible ? Vous trouvez difficile de croire qu'un aventurier pourrait vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres, Capitaine ? N'avez-vous pas entendu ce que disent les habitants ?${prompt}
  7940: Ils disent que l'Âge des Aventuriers est arrivé !${prompt}
  7941: Hmph. Seuls les historiens, avec le recul, ont le privilège de dire de telles choses.${prompt}
  7942: Et il n'importe pas s'ils ont seulement empêché le retour du Seigneur des Ombres, ou s'ils l'ont réellement vaincu.${prompt}
  7943: |-
    L'important, c'est qu'ils ont empêché les Kindred de gagner en puissance.
    Et cela, je crois, mérite une récompense.${prompt}
  7944: |-
    Bon travail. Je vous augmente en grade.
    Et voici votre récompense bien méritée.${prompt}
  7945: |-
    Le Seigneur des Ombres a peut-être été vaincu à nouveau, mais les Kindred sont loin d'être battus.
    J'ai reçu des rapports d'événements étranges dans les forteresses des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  7946: Vous avez probablement entendu cela trop de fois, mais...nous comptons sur vous.${prompt}
  7947: |-
    Alors c'était qui le Seigneur des Ombres...
    Zeid devait le savoir, et c'est probablement pourquoi il est parti seul.${prompt}
  7948: Ne dites rien de cela à Volker. Le sort d'Ulrich doit également lui être caché. Il ne pourrait peut-être pas l'accepter encore.${prompt}
  7949: Il admirait beaucoup son grand-père...c'est pourquoi cela lui faisait mal d'entendre dire que Volker lui-même n'était devenu Capitaine que parce que Raogrimm n'était plus là.${prompt}
  7950: Je sais que lui cacher la vérité n'est pas une bonne chose, mais la plupart d'entre nous ne sont pas aussi forts que vous. Nous avons besoin de temps pour guérir.${prompt}
  7951: Désolé de vous interrompre. De quoi parlez-vous tous les deux ?${prompt}
  7952: Euh...juste de dire que Karst n'a vraiment pas changé, même après tout cela.${prompt}
  7953: |-
    Oui, mais je pense que je le comprends mieux maintenant.
    Je l'ai peut-être jugé trop sévèrement.${prompt}
  7954: En parlant de cela...vous ne nous avez toujours pas dit pourquoi vous avez soutenu le Président Karst lors des dernières élections, Chef.${prompt}
  7955: Oh, ça. Eh bien... Il y a quinze ans, même après ma démission de mon poste de chef de la Salle de la Poudre, le Sénat était toujours en chaos, essayant de trouver plus de personnes à blâmer pour l'accident à Palborough.${prompt}
  7956: Mais il y avait un jeune sénateur qui a proposé d'abandonner Palborough et de rouvrir les Mines de Zeruhn. Ce jeune sénateur était Karst.${prompt}
  7957: |-
    Les mineurs risquaient de perdre beaucoup, mais à l'époque, sa proposition était le meilleur pari pour Bastok.
    Je suis un ingénieur, donc je respecte la compétence. Et j'ai senti que les compétences politiques de Karst pouvaient être dignes de confiance.${prompt}
  7958: |-
    Et c'est un vrai Bastoker aussi--très ambitieux et facile à comprendre.
    Je me souviens encore du regard enthousiaste qu'il avait lorsqu'il a annoncé sa proposition au Sénat !${prompt}
  7959: Hah hah hah!${prompt}
  7960: |-
    Lady Cornelia n'est pas ici en ce moment.
    J'espère qu'elle ne rentrera pas trop tard...${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Lady Cornelia est dans sa chambre en train d'étudier.
    Revenez une autre fois--${prompt}
  7962: J'en ai assez d'étudier. Je sors !${prompt}
  7963: |-
    Milady, ne--
    Oh, encore une fois !${prompt}
  7964: |-
    Pourquoi doit-elle être comme ça ?
    Si la Première Dame était encore en vie, elle n'aurait jamais toléré ce genre de comportement !${prompt}
  7965: |-
    Lady Cornelia est dans sa chambre en train d'étudier.
    Pour une fois, elle ne--${prompt}
  7966: Non, Milady ! Pas cette fois ! Le président m'a donné des ordres stricts de ne pas vous laisser sortir de votre--${prompt}
  7967: |-
    Bonjour.
    Entrez.${prompt}
  7968: |-
    Oh, vous attendiez un invité !
    Je suis désolé, je pensais que vous essayiez de vous échapper--${prompt}
  7969: |-
    Attendez, Milady, non ! Vous ne devriez pas laisser entrer un aventurier dans votre chambre !
    Vous savez quels endroits ils fréquentent ! Et ce ne serait pas convenable !${prompt}
  7970: |-
    Oh, la la... Pouvez-vous la croire ?
    C'est ce que je dois endurer chaque jour.
    Mais je parviens généralement à sortir en douce.${prompt}
  7971: Je voulais vous demander--avez-vous déjà entendu l'histoire de Cornelia la Mousquetaire ?${prompt}
  7972: |-
    Avez-vous déjà entendu parler d'une Mousquetaire nommée Cornelia ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, je l'ai entendu.
    Qui ?${prompt}
  7973: |-
    Cornelia, la moine devenue Mythril Mousquetaire, est assez célèbre.
    Elle aidait tous ceux dans le besoin, qu'ils soient Galka ou Hume, riches ou pauvres.${prompt}
  7974: Tu n'as jamais entendu parler d'elle ? C'était une moine devenue Mousquetaire de Mythril. Elle aidait tous ceux qui étaient dans le besoin, Galka et Humains, riches et pauvres.${prompt}
  7975: On disait qu'elle et Talekeeper Raogrimm – le seul Galka destiné à devenir Capitaine des Mousquetaires s'il était encore en vie – partageaient un amour interdit...${prompt}
  7976: Mais personne ne sait si c'est vrai, car aucun des deux n'est revenu de leur expédition à Xarcabard il y a trente ans.${prompt}
  7977: Ma mère m'a nommée d'après elle. Elle m'a dit qu'elle voulait que je grandisse pour être comme elle – quelqu'un qui traite tout le monde de manière égale, et aimée de tous.${prompt}
  7978: C'est peut-être pour ça que j'essaie tellement d'aider les Galka... bien que même si je ne m'appelais pas Cornelia, je ne resterais pas sans rien faire en les voyant être traités comme ça.${prompt}
  7979: Mais ce n'est pas bon. Tu l'as vu toi-même. Je n'arrive tout simplement pas à faire les choses correctement. J'aimerais être aussi forte et intelligente que Lady Cornelia...${prompt}
  7980: Un enfant Galka m'a dit l'autre jour, “Pourquoi tu te donnes tant de mal ? Qu'est-ce que tu peux faire, tu n'es qu'une fille !”${prompt}
  7981: Peut-être qu'il a raison. Peut-être que je ne peux rien changer...${prompt}
  7982: |-
    Non ! Je dois essayer plus fort !
    Je vais montrer à ce prétentieux de Gumbah ce que je peux faire !${prompt}
  7983: Je suis désolée de te laisser comme ça, mais je dois y aller !${prompt}
  7984: Ces portes mènent au Bureau du Président.${prompt}
  7985: |-
    Entrer dans le Bureau du Président ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7986: |-
    Sortir du Bureau du Président ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7987: Je compile des données sur les effets des projets miniers et industriels de Bastok sur l'environnement.${prompt}
  7988: Ces roues sont suffisantes pour alimenter Bastok maintenant, mais que feront-ils quand les besoins de la ville dépasseront la quantité d'énergie qu'elles peuvent produire ?${prompt}
  7989: J'ai entendu des aventuriers dire que le déversement de déchets industriels par les Quadav a pollué Beadeaux et ses environs.${prompt}
  7990: |-
    J'aimerais examiner un peu de ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.
    J'ai entendu dire que tu peux en trouver près de leurs forges, et que c'est plus facile à repérer les jours de pluie.${prompt}
  7991: |-
    Ah, tu m'as apporté un peu du ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} de Beadeaux que je t'avais demandé !

  8128: Maitre Oggbi! Il n'était pas nécessaire que vous veniez jusqu'ici. Nous serions venus à vous.${prompt}
  8129: Non, quand j'ai entendu parler de sa résurrection, mon sang s'est mis à bouillonner.${prompt}
  8130: Nous pensons qu'il pourrait s'agir d'une descendance de la nouvelle génération de Yagudo. Nous pensons également que la montée en puissance des Kindreds pourrait également contribuer à son retour.${prompt}
  8131: Actuellement, les Mythril Musketeers sont uniquement composés de guerriers, de samouraïs et d'un chevalier noir disparu. Aucun moine compétent n'existe.${prompt}
  8132: "San d'Oria est plus que probablement dans la même situation. Le monastère n'est plus en mesure de produire les moines de qualité d'autrefois. \nEt Windurst... ces Tarutaru et leur magie ne sont bons à rien.${prompt}"

  8141: Maître ! Permettez-moi de vous accompagner ! Je suis plus que prêt !${prompt}
  8142: Non, non, non ! Vous avez peut-être assez de puissance pour attirer ce Yagudo hors de sa cachette, mais vous manquez encore d'expérience pour le vaincre.${prompt}
  8143: Mais Maître, la raison pour laquelle je suis devenu votre élève était pour acquérir assez de compétences pour le vaincre... Pour pouvoir venger la mort de mon frère...${prompt}
  8144: |-
    Penses-tu que je ne le savais pas ?
    Ton frère était un moine talentueux qui a connu une mort tragique.

    C'est... Alors vous avez réussi à vaincre les Yagudo ?
    Je ne savais pas qu'il existait encore des moines aussi puissants...${prompt}
  8155: Autrefois, Maître Oggbi travaillait dur pour promouvoir la fusion des arts martiaux et des techniques de combat san d'oréennes. Une telle collaboration a évidemment produit de nombreux combattants exceptionnels.${prompt}
  8156: Même un samouraï comme moi est admiratif de votre capacité extraordinaire. Veuillez accepter ceci en paiement de votre service.${prompt}

  8165: Je vois...${prompt}
  8166: Rien ne vient de la vengeance. Elle ne fait que nous faire perdre ce qui nous anime.${prompt}
  8167: Toi...${prompt}
  8168: On dit que ceux qui n'ont rien à perdre sont souvent les plus forts.${prompt}
  8169: |-
    Il est fort probable que tu aies ressenti la même chose, Cornelia.

    La véritable force vient à ceux qui ont quelque chose, ou quelqu'un, à protéger.${prompt}
  8171: Et vous... avez-vous quelque chose qui vaut la peine d'être protégé ?${prompt}
  8172: Je porte avec moi plus de deux cents ans de souvenirs. Parfois, ils peuvent être un fardeau, mais c'est mon devoir de les protéger.${prompt}
  8173: Pour protéger les sourires des personnes dans ces souvenirs, je peux supporter le traitement que je reçois de ces politiciens mesquins du Bureau du Président.${prompt} 
  8174: Trouverai-je jamais quelque chose... quelque chose qui vaut la peine d'être protégé ?${prompt}

  8186: |-
    Bon retour, Sir Raogrimm !
    Vous avez battu des orcs cette fois-ci ?${prompt}
  8187: Pagdako. Ma mission cette fois était une simple expédition. Il n'y avait pas de "bastonnade" d'orcs.${prompt}
  8188: Ouais, mais ça ne change rien pour un mercenaire comme moi. Je me suis bien amusé, et j'ai trouvé de bon matériel pour faire une nouvelle épée en prime !${prompt}
  8189: Nous sommes tombés sur un autre groupe aussi... Ouais, un vieux moine voyageant avec une jeune fille mignonne et pleine de tempérament.${prompt}
  8190: Je n'ai aucun intérêt pour les méthodes que vous utilisez pour "trouver" du bon matériel, mais je sais que vous êtes un sacré combattant. C'est dommage que vous gaspilliez votre talent en aventures.${prompt}
  8191: Oh, s'il vous plaît. Quelles aventures m'attendent avec le titre de Mousquetaire ? La garde ? Hé, je ne suis pas un portier !${prompt}
  8192: |-
    Vous êtes un drôle de personnage, Yasin.
    Le matériel que vous avez ramené - j'aurai un de mes compagnons forgerons le transformer en épée pour vous. Ce sera votre paiement pour vos devoirs cette fois. D'accord ?${prompt}
  8193: Ça me va, Mousquetaire.${prompt}

    Points de conquête.
    Les effets de la prise de contrôle des régions.
    Régions contrôlées par d'autres nations.
    Régions sous le contrôle des bêtes.${prompt}
  8227: Les trois nations s'efforcent quotidiennement de mettre sous leur contrôle un maximum de régions. C'est ce que nous appelons les "conquêtes". Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en vainquant des ennemis lorsque le Sceau est activé sur vous.${prompt}
  8228: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui élimine le plus de monstres dans ces zones prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  8229: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  8230: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}
  8231: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des avant-postes au sein des régions sous notre contrôle.
    Ils sont là pour lancer le Sceau sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8232: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez obtenir des cristaux des ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
  8233: De plus, vous recevrez des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  8234: |-
    Comme vous le voyez... les conquêtes bénéficient aux nations et aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
  8235: |-
    Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant "Info Région" dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}
  8236: |-
    Les boutiques de notre ville vendront des articles différents en fonction de notre classement en conquête.
    La Troupe Valeriano visitera également la nation qui termine première et apportera un peu de joie à ses citoyens.${prompt}
  8237: |-
    Vous pouvez donner des cristaux à votre nation une fois que vous atteignez le rang 2.
    Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}

    Nous aimerions que vous donniez des cristaux à votre nation à partir de maintenant.
    Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}
  8239: |-
    Vous pouvez obtenir des cristaux en vainquant des ennemis lorsque le Sceau de votre nation est activé sur vous.
    Avoir le Sceau de votre nation activé sur vous est également le seul moyen de participer aux conquêtes.${prompt}
  8240: Des points de rang vous seront attribués pour chaque cristal que vous donnez, et vous pourriez vous voir proposer de nouvelles missions à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}
  8241: |-
    Vous recevez également des points de rang pour avoir terminé des missions.
    Terminez des missions et participez aux conquêtes pour augmenter votre rang et servir votre pays.${prompt}

    Vous recevez des points de conquête lorsque vous vainquez des monstres tout en participant aux conquêtes.
    Sélectionnez "Info Région" dans le menu pour vérifier votre nombre actuel de points de conquête.${prompt}
  8243: Vous pouvez acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi avec vos points de conquête, mais sachez que le nombre de points que vous dépensez sera déduit de votre total actuel.${prompt}
  8244: Lorsque les résultats de la conquête sont annoncés, on vous dira quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les bêtes peuvent prendre le contrôle des régions.${prompt}
  8245: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes frontaliers seront placés dans ses avant-postes pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8246: Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
  8247: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base derrière les conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et amène notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
  8248: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les résultats de la conquête suivante ne soient annoncés.${prompt}
  8249: En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  8250: Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation classée en tête.${prompt}
  8251: |-
    Notre principale préoccupation réside dans le fait que les bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
  8252: Si cela se produit, non seulement c'est un grand coup pour notre fierté, mais vous serez également incapable d'acquérir des cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  8253: Les bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
  8254: Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des fournitures aux gardes de frontière des avant-postes qui sont placés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
  8255: Il y a un avant-poste dans chaque région. Sélectionnez "Infos Région" dans le menu, et recherchez les zones avec un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là qu'ils se trouvent.${prompt}
  8256: |-
    Voici les fournitures. Il suffit de les donner au garde à l'avant-poste et votre mission sera accomplie.

  8554: The Galka methods of darksteel-working are recently being looked on in a different light. This, coupled with the recent rise in adventurers bringing in darksteel ore, has resulted in an increase in the production of darksteel goods.${prompt}

    They say that in the olden days, all dark knight equipment was forged from darksteel.
    I would be willing to repay you handsomely if you could retrieve that book for me.${prompt}
  8558: |-
    What?
    You say Raibaht is searching for the book ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?${prompt}
  8559: I see he's finally come to his senses. I've been trying to get him to ask Chief Cid to pour more money into the darksteel program.${prompt}
  8560: 'Well, knowing Raibaht, he probably had to think and re-think it, but he still hasn''t made up his mind. Hopefully, seeing ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} will help to push him in the right direction.${prompt}'
  8561: 'The problem is, ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} was donated to a library somewhere before I was appointed to this position.${prompt}'
  8562: And on top of that, there's no record of the donation anywhere. I guess I can't complain. That was back in the day when mythril was the material of choice, cermet was getting all the funding, and darksteel...well, darksteel was about as popular as rusty buckets...${prompt}
  8563: '...and worth about the same, too.${prompt}'
  8564: I will write a letter to the library holding the document. You will need to take this letter and show it to the proprietor of the library.${prompt}
  8565: 'Excellent! You''ve retrieved our copy of ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}! Quickly, take it to Raibaht.${prompt}'
  8566: Yes, this is the book I was in search of. Please accept this for your troubles. It is a sample product forged by our head smith--and I assure you, it is of the highest quality.${prompt}
  8567: Now I can continue my research on the forging of darksteel...and make a decision on whether or not to ask Chief Cid for more funding.${prompt}
  8568: You were going to ask me what, now?${prompt}

    I used to collect those for good luck.${prompt}
  8589: I don't think that's something I would be boasting about, Naji.${prompt}
  8590: S-Sir Lucius!${prompt}
  8591: Some theorize that the Palborough Mines were once holy lands for the Quadav, and that Bastok forced the beastmen from their land.${prompt}
  8592: And those “dolls” that you collect are actually idols representing their ancestral hero.${prompt}
  8593: Of course, this has nothing to do with your mission. Those pieces you have brought back are nothing more than proof of your success.${prompt}
  8594: But remember this, Naji. Things in the world often look different depending on where you stand. Even though we are not obligated to search for knowledge, truth is only found by those who have the will...${prompt}

  8599: Oh? This is a surprise. It's not every day that you ask me a favor.${prompt}
  8600: It is said that the Gusgen Mines are a haven for paranormal activity. Priests from the San d'Oria Cathedral have even performed certain rituals of consecration there. As far as magic research is concerned, it's certainly a significant location.${prompt}
  8601: I have the feeling that I'm about to get a lecture on why the presidential aide shouldn't be dabbling in magic.${prompt}
  8602: Don't get me wrong, Lucius. I don't know squat about magic, but I've never questioned its power.${prompt}
  8603: I know darn well that you've spent your career trying to get the people of Bastok to see the benefits of magic.${prompt}
  8604: You managed to get San d'Oria to cooperate with us in the creation of new magic spells by making good use of the results of my Crystal Line research. Those new spells have helped bring many mage adventurers to Bastok.${prompt}

    So never doubt your cause.

    And let me tell you one more thing.
    You don't go and overwork yourself, hear? You're one of the few people in this city who Karst needs.
    You go down, and he goes down.${prompt}
  8608: There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.${prompt}
  8609: It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.${prompt}
  8610: Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.${prompt}
  8611: I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.${prompt}
  8612: Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.${prompt}
  8613: That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.${prompt}
  8614: Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.${prompt}
  8615: Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.${prompt}
  8616: We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.${prompt}
  8617: The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.${prompt}
  8618: 'You''ve been ordered by the president to deliver that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.${prompt}'
  8619: It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.${prompt}
  8620: Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.${prompt}
  8621: As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  8622: You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.${prompt}
  8623: Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.${prompt}
  8624: It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...${prompt}
  8625: I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.${prompt}
  8626: Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.${prompt}
  8627: According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.${prompt}
  8628: The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.${prompt}
  8629: You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.${prompt}
  8630: Ah, ${name-player}. It looks like you're ready for your next mission. I've heard that you're traveling to Norg this time.${prompt}
  8631: What? I'm supposed to be giving you the details? That's funny. I don't remember being assigned to this mission...${prompt}
  8632: It looks as if the guard mixed the two of us up--as if that could happen. I'm the one who will be relaying the adventurer's orders.${prompt}
  8633: As if that could happen!?${prompt}
  8634: Your mission to Norg is that of a trade emissary.${prompt}
  8635: Norg is constantly attempting to strengthen its ties with adventurers. They often rely on them to do certain jobs involving trade.${prompt}
  8636: Compared to Windurst and San d'Oria, Bastok's relations with Norg run much deeper. That is why, for the sake of our republic's commerce, we are sending adventurers to such a remote location.${prompt}
  8637: I was to accompany you on this mission, but first I must complete another small task.${prompt}
  8638: Travel to Norg and meet with their leader, Gilgamesh. He will give you further information on what you are to do. I will rendezvous with you in Norg when I have finished my current assignment.${prompt}
  8639: |-
    And that's the gist of it...
    Wait. Before you go, could you come over here for a second?${prompt}
  8640: The reason I called you over here is that I want you to try to finish this mission ASAP...preferably, before Ayame arrives.${prompt}
  8641: I know this must sound strange, but you've got to help me out here. Recently Ayame has been acting...well, strange. It's like she's missing that, that “something.”${prompt}
  8642: The other day, she was defeated by an enemy that, well, even you could take out.${prompt}
  8643: And now she's using that as an excuse to restart her samurai training.${prompt}
  8644: You can probably tell by looking at me, but we Mythril Musketeers don't spend much time out there on the front lines.${prompt}
  8645: That makes it hard for us to keep our battle skills brushed up. I think that's what's bothering Ayame. She wants to get back what she thinks she has lost.${prompt}
  8646: And now she wants to travel to Norg. That will just make things worse!${prompt}
  8647: As much as I want to be number four, I don't want it because she leaves. That's why she's got to remain a Musketeer.${prompt}
  8648: |-
    You know what you've got to do!
    And keep quiet about this to Ayame...${prompt}
  8649: |-
    You're finally back from Norg.
    So, did you see Ayame?${prompt}
  8650: You mean, she said all of that?${prompt}
  8651: I guess she went to Norg to reconfirm what she already knew deep down in her heart.${prompt}
  8652: Hey, don't you go off telling her that I was worried about her, now!${prompt}
  8653: It's just that, well, Ayame gets all the good missions while I get zilch. I wish I got to go to Norg...${prompt}
  8654: I don't think Norg needs any more doorboys.${prompt}
  8655: Yeah, you're probably right...${prompt}
  8656: Wait a minute! What do you mean, “doorboy”!?${prompt}
  8657: You move one inch from your post and I'll have you on latrine duty!${prompt}
  8658: |-
    Yes, ma'am.
    All clear on the northern front...${prompt}
  8659: Ah, it's nice to see you again. But enough with the greetings; let me tell you about your next mission.${prompt}
  8660: You've heard of the ancient civilization of the Zilart, haven't you? Well, there are archeological remains of this civilization scattered about Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8661: The Zilart used a material called cermet to construct many of these structures. This cermet is more advanced than anything found in Bastok.${prompt}
  8662: Researching and reproducing this material would do wonders for Bastok's industry. Ancient cermet technology is the building block of the future, so to speak.${prompt}
  8663: 'Deep within the Sanctuary of Zi''Tah you will find the entrance to Ro''Maeve. I want you to bring me some ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} from there.${prompt}'
  8664: I'll be waiting for you here.${prompt}
  8665: 'Ha ha! You got your hands on ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}! Now I can continue my cermet research.${prompt}'
  8666: Chief Cid...${prompt}
  8667: Don't you go getting your feathers ruffled, Raibaht. I'm not going to be making any cuts in darksteel research.${prompt}
  8668: Chief, we have a visitor.${prompt}
  8669: Thank you.${prompt}
  8670: What's wrong, Cornelia? Did you have a fight with your father again?${prompt}
  8671: It's not anything like that...but it does have to do with my father.${prompt}
  8672: Just a few minutes ago, I met with this young Galka.${prompt}
  8673: Oh! There you are, Cornelia!${prompt}
  8674: Gumbah! Why did you follow me?${prompt}
  8675: I had something I wanted to ask you, and I was worried about what I was going to do if I couldn't find you.${prompt}
  8676: Hey, wait. You aren't going to send me on one of your weird quests, are you? I can't trust you after the last time.${prompt}
  8677: I never made you do anything that weird! Anyway, this time is different. I want you to search for Werei for me.${prompt}
  8678: You mean the same Werei that you lived with a while back? The same Werei that disappeared...${prompt}
  8679: He hasn't disappeared... He's set out on his journey of rebirth. I don't expect to ever see him in the form of Werei again.${prompt}
  8680: But, leaving without saying anything... It just doesn't make any sense. There must be some reason.${prompt}
  8681: And so I thought that if I asked you, you might be able to do something. The situation in the Mines District is not getting any better, and any information would help.${prompt}
  8682: But, I don't know if I could be of any help...${prompt}
  8683: What do you mean? Your dad's the president. Couldn't you just ask him to help you out?${prompt}
  8684: How did you know that...!?${prompt}
  8685: You think I didn't already know? Everybody knows. Are you still in the dark?${prompt}
  8686: Well...even if I am the president's daughter, I can't use my position like that. It wouldn't be right.${prompt}
  8687: What do you mean? You're always saying that you want to help the Galka!${prompt}
  8688: You weren't lying, were you? Or was that just your way of showing pity for us poor Galka?${prompt}
  8689: Gumbah! How could you say that? Of course I want to help you, it's just that...${prompt}
  8690: You're just saying that to make your ego feel better. Whether you like it or not, you are in a position of power.${prompt}
  8691: Why don't you use that power? Stop trying to run from...it...${prompt}
  8692: |-
    What!?
    If you have something to say to me, say it!${prompt}
  8693: |-
    I'm sorry, Cornelia. I didn't mean that...
    Forget what I said. I'll try searching for Werei on my own.${prompt}
  8694: That Gumbah! I can't believe him sometimes!${prompt}
  8695: So, did you talk to your father?${prompt}
  8696: |-
    No...
    I couldn't ask him for help.${prompt}
  8697: Cornelia. I'm just a simple engineer. I don't know what the best choice is here.${prompt}
  8698: But I do know one thing...${prompt}
  8699: Back in the days when Bastok was filled with old wooden houses, there was a big fire that wiped out most of the homes.${prompt}
  8700: However, at that time Bastok was a poor country, and very few funds could be used for the rebuilding of the houses.${prompt}
  8701: Two propositions were offered to the government. One was to collect donations.${prompt}
  8702: The other was to give priority to the merchants of that area in exchange for contributions to the rebuilding. That was the plan proposed by your young father.${prompt}
  8703: Which do you think is right, Cornelia?${prompt}
  8704: Asking...for the donations of people?${prompt}
  8705: I guess that is one way of solving the problem. That's what the president at that time chose, and it helped get him votes.${prompt}
  8706: However, six months went by, and the rebuilding of the district was not even close to being finished. There were still people living out on the streets with no place to go.${prompt}
  8707: Your father's plan was finally put into effect, and slowly but surely, the district began to take shape once again.${prompt}
  8708: Maybe it's just the engineer in me talking, but I think that when you're too busy choosing the parts, you sometimes lose sight of what you're really trying to make.${prompt}
  8709: Don't you go and forget what you're trying to make now, Cornelia. You have to decide what you're going to do.${prompt}
  8710: Oh, ${name-player}. I'm sorry you had to hear all that. You can go now. I'll make the report.${prompt}
  8711: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} you brought me... This will help me get closer to what I''m really trying to make.${prompt}'
  8712: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}. Currently, we are investigating the whereabouts of a certain Galka named Werei. You have heard of him, have you not?${prompt}
  8713: It sounds like another aging Galka has just set off on his journey of rebirth, but the residents of the Mining District are not taking this very well.${prompt}
  8714: There is so much bigotry when it comes to these racial problems, it is hard to act on anything.${prompt}
  8715: However, there is one thing that interests me. There is a rumor that a certain adventurer has received a letter from this Werei.${prompt}
  8716: I would like you to find this adventurer and find out what he knows. However...${prompt}
  8717: Come, follow me.${prompt}
  8718: Milady. An adventurer would like to speak with you.${prompt}
  8719: Does this mean my father has finally agreed to start an investigation!?${prompt}
  8720: Father! What is the meaning of this!?${prompt}
  8721: Don't get me wrong, Cornelia. If you want to lock yourself up in this room, I won't stop you.${prompt}
  8722: I have received a report from Iron Eater stating that finding the whereabouts of Werei may help calm down some of the Galka in the Mines District.${prompt}
  8723: I am only here to gather information on the subject from those who may know something--namely you. I have no time for your petty games.${prompt}
  8724: But, when I tried talking to you before, you wouldn't...${prompt}
  8725: Do you have any information for me? If not, I will assign this adventurer to another mission, and that will be the end of things.${prompt}
  8726: |-
    Wait...
    I did hear something at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant. An adventurer named Hani...${prompt}
  8727: This adventurer said he met Werei while traveling through the Korroloka Tunnel, and received a letter from him.${prompt}
  8728: However, since then, no one has seen him.${prompt}
  8729: The proprietor of the Steaming Sheep, Hilda, may know more...${prompt}
  8730: Understood. ${name-player} will take the investigation from here.${prompt}
  8731: Wait, Father.${prompt}
  8732: Am...am I foolish to think I can make a difference, or am I just a hypocrite?${prompt}
  8733: Cornelia...${prompt}
  8734: I once heard a Far Eastern legend that stated hypocrisy is born from the acts of good that one performs.${prompt}
  8735: Whereas the word used to symbolize a simple act of human nature, over the years, the meaning of the word became warped to the negative tone that it holds today.${prompt}
  8736: Whenever anyone tries to do anything, there will always be someone there to judge them. I have experienced that my whole life, but it has never stopped me from pursuing my goals.${prompt}
  8737: I won't let anyone stand in my way.${prompt}
  8738: You've got a good ten years before you can start complaining about what is right and what is wrong. Don't forget that.${prompt}
  8739: Father...${prompt}
  8740: ${name-player}. You have your orders. Speak with Hilda at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant and find out more on this Hani character.${prompt}
  8741: Lady Cornelia has locked herself in her room and will not come out...${prompt}
  8742: What is this you say? The Hani in question got himself caught by the Quadav? By the sounds of it, you adventurers have quite a carefree lifestyle.${prompt}
  8743: Well, no matter. We can now be certain that Werei set out on his journey of his own free will. Let me reward you for your service and raise your rank.${prompt}
  8744: The letter you carry--deliver it to the proper recipient. I am not going to let this problem escalate by meddling with it. Let the Galka see the truth with their own eyes.${prompt}
  8745: I see that you already delivered the letter to its proper recipient. I am not going to let this problem escalate by meddling with it. Let the Galka see the truth with their own eyes.${prompt}
  8746: We've been expecting you. Captain Volker is awaiting your arrival in the Conference Room.${prompt}
  8747: Ah, ${name-player}. For your next mission, I would like you to travel to the Altepa Desert to investigate the Quicksand Caves. These caves are an important location amongst the ruins of the Galkan civilization.${prompt}
  8748: Why, you ask, are we starting an investigation into the Galkan ruins?${prompt}
  8749: It all started with a letter addressed to Iron Eater.${prompt}
  8750: “The time has come to unlock the past and step forth into the future. I await the adventurer near the statue of the Talekeeper in the Quicksand Caves.”${prompt}
  8751: There is no name on the letter, but I know who wrote it... Zeid.${prompt}
  8752: If I could, I would like to go myself. However, if I did, Zeid would most certainly not show up.${prompt}
  8753: You met with Zeid when you defeated the Shadow Lord. If he would talk with anyone, it would be you.${prompt}
  8754: Your mission is to seek out this “statue of the Talekeeper” and find out what Zeid meant about “unlocking the past.”${prompt}
  8755: The Quicksand Caves are shrouded in mystery. There is not much we know of the area. You may face many hardships during your investigation, but we are counting on your success.${prompt}
  8756: I welcome you back from your journey. What did you find in the Quicksand Caves?${prompt}
  8757: I see... The history of the Galka...${prompt}
  8758: Zeid must feel the same as I do--that this is a turning point in our history.${prompt}
  8759: However, his mention of the Talekeeper... Does he really believe that a new one is among us?${prompt}
  8760: "And why would Zeid suddenly want to see Volker? What shall I tell the \ncaptain...?${prompt}"
  8761: |-
    Ah, excuse me.
    Excellent work on your mission. I will handle things from here. However, I feel that we may require your future services for an investigation of Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  8762: |-
    I never thought that Gumbah...
    And to think that we could have been putting extra pressure on him without even knowing it.${prompt}
  8763: It is time to call forth an end to the era of one Galka holding on to ancient history.${prompt}
  8764: It is time that we start working towards carving a new history here, in Bastok.${prompt}

  8827: If you have enough gil in the budget to fund such a foolish mission, why not use some of that money to improve the output of the mills in Konschtat?${prompt}
  8828: Calm down, Iron Eater.${prompt}
  8829: |-
    Gumbah?
    Why are you here?${prompt}
  8830: Oh, I just came to thank a friend.${prompt}
  8831: What is a dirty little Galka doing in the President's Office?${prompt}
  8832: |-
    Dirty little Galka!?
    You don't know anything about what happened in the Mines District?${prompt}
  8833: |-
    That is of no matter, Iron Eater.
    Senator Alois, this salt you are talking of--if I am not mistaken, it is called ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. I have heard many things of this seasoning.${prompt}
  8834: Such as, it can slow the hands of aging on the clock of life.${prompt}
  8835: |-
    Exactly.
    At this age, I have to think of my health...${prompt}
  8836: I knew you were only thinking of yourself...${prompt}
  8837: |-
    Ahem.
    I have heard that the area it is found in is extremely dangerous. Therefore, rather than risking the lives of less experienced adventurers, I thought it would be in our best interest to send one more competent. Say, the one who defeated the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  8838: I cannot even believe what I am hearing...${prompt}
  8839: |-
    Hmmm...
    That sounds like an excellent idea.${prompt}
  8840: What...?${prompt}
  8841: (Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.)${prompt}
  8842: Anyway, it does not matter whether you like it or not. The mission has already been approved by the Senate, and this fine adventurer has already accepted it.${prompt}
  8843: ${name-player}, you are to travel to Rabao and obtain further details on your task from Dancing Wolf. He has already been sent to investigate the location of the salt.${prompt}
  8844: Iron Eater, I have a favor to ask of you. Come and see me later.${prompt}
  8845: |-
    Understood...
    I will trust the judgment of our Talekeeper.${prompt}
  8846: Talekeeper? That sounds so formal...${prompt}
  8847: So, ${name-player}, can I count on your help, too? Don't worry. I won't let this end up as a mere grocery run for our fine senator.${prompt}
  8848: 'Did you have this salt inspected by Dancing Wolf before bringing it to me? How am I supposed to know that this is truly ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} if you haven''t had it checked? Back to Rabao with you!${prompt}'
  8849: Ah, I've already read the report from the guard in Rabao. I assume you're carrying the salt with you.${prompt}
  8850: Yes... This salt will add another five years to my--I mean, our citizens' lives.${prompt}
  8851: That sounds wonderful, Alois.${prompt}
  8852: Well, if it isn't the president's little pet. What business do you have here?${prompt}
  8853: 'I am pleased to know that you will be working hard to make sure that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} is used to better improve the lives and welfare of the citizens of Bastok.${prompt}'
  8854: If I find that you have not, I will be sending a bill, covering all expenses, to your company.${prompt}
  8855: Hm? I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
  8856: I have learned that the funds received for this mission and the further research of the salt have been deposited into one of your companies' accounts.${prompt}
  8857: If the results of your research are beneficial to the Bastokan Republic, I am sure no one will have any problem with this minute detail. However, if it is learned that nothing has come of this mission, you will be ordered to promptly return all the gil you have received...plus interest.${prompt}
  8858: But you should already know all this. It was announced at last month's senate meeting... Oh wait, if I recall, you were asleep for half of the session.${prompt}
  8859: How...how dare you!${prompt}
  8860: And if you are considering putting pressure on the investigators of this case, you may want to reconsider. I shall personally be heading up the team.${prompt}
  8861: 'Finally, a piece of advice for you, senator. If you really want to live longer, you should cut down on the ${item-plural: 6[2]}.${prompt}'
  8862: Why, I...I...${prompt}
  8863: |-
    And I guess that is that.
    But how did Gumbah know what the senator was really up to...?${prompt}
  8864: |-
    Well, I guess that is of no concern to us.
    I commend you on the completion of this mission. You will be informed when your services are again required.${prompt}
  8865: However, we may require your services sooner than you expect.${prompt}
  8866: It seems as if one of our adventurers was attacked while on an investigation in the Northlands...${prompt}
  8867: The young politicians these days have no respect for their elders! Why, in my day...${prompt}
  8868: |-
    Milady!
    I will not allow you to sneak out of your chambers again, and I will definitely not allow any adventurers in here.${prompt}
  8869: Oh, ${name-player}. My father sent you, right?${prompt}
  8870: |-
    The president!
    I...I apologize. Please proceed...${prompt}
  8871: |-
    Wait...
    Milady! I have not heard of any meetings with any adventurers! You have tricked me!
    Milady!${prompt}
  8872: Franziska means well, but she's got to loosen up, don't you think?${prompt}
  8873: Anyway, you'll never guess who was here just a couple of days ago.${prompt}
  8874: I can't believe that my father would even let him near this place...${prompt}
  8875: Gumbah. Gumbah came here, to my room. He didn't say anything for the first few minutes, but when he opened his mouth, the first words out were “thank you.”${prompt}
  8876: |-
    “Thank you.”
    What did he mean? I haven't done anything worth thanking. I've only caused him pain and trouble.${prompt}
  8877: For someone who has lived more than two hundred years, he's not that good with telling people how he feels. But, you know, I'm kind of happy that he told me what he did...${prompt}
  8878: I've only been on Vana'diel for a tenth of time he has, so I can't really talk about being good at expressing feelings...${prompt}
  8879: Anyway, once the ice was broken, we started talking about all sorts of stuff.${prompt}
  8880: For some reason, he seemed really interested in one of Lucius' new programs. I wonder what that was all about?${prompt}
  8881: |-
    Milady!
    It is time for your studies!${prompt}
  8882: Yes, Franziska! I know!${prompt}
  8883: You know, I think I'm going to start putting a little more effort into my studies. I think I finally know what I want to be when I get older.${prompt}
  8884: What do I want to be? I can't tell you yet. That's still a secret.${prompt}
  8885: Well, you should probably go before Franziska has Iron Eater drag you out. Thanks for coming and listening to me.${prompt}
  8886: Recently, Lady Cornelia has taken up an interest in her studies. However, how long this will last, I do not know...${prompt}
  8887: We've been waiting for you, ${name-player}. Some unbelievable events have taken place recently...${prompt}
  8888: It seems as if the dark knight Zeid attacked one of our adventurers in the Northlands, and forced her to deliver a letter addressed to Captain Volker.${prompt}
  8889: Even more unbelievable is the content of that letter...${prompt}
  8890: But enough talking. We should enter the President's Office now.${prompt}
  8891: What is the meaning of this!?${prompt}
  8892: Give me one good reason why you were compelled to hide the truth about what my uncle did over thirty years ago!${prompt}
  8893: |-
    Volker...
    We weren't trying to hide it from you...${prompt}
  8894: |-
    Wait...
    You knew about this too?${prompt}
  8895: Knew about...? Well...you see...${prompt}
  8896: Oh, and the next thing you'll tell me is that ${name-player} knew all about this as well!${prompt}
  8897: So the only person who didn't know anything about it was the one with the cursed blood running through his veins! Me!${prompt}
  8898: Is that all you've got, Raogrimm!?${prompt}
  8899: Ulrich, why!?${prompt}
  8900: Why? Because I never liked you, that's why!${prompt}
  8901: You will never get away with this, Ulrich!${prompt}
  8902: Watch me!
  8903: '...Cornelia!?${prompt}'
  8904: Wh-what have I done!?${prompt}
  8905: I didn't join the Musketeers because of my uncle, but that didn't stop the rumors--the rumors that it was my uncle's influence that got me my position.${prompt}
  8906: And so I was promoted to Mythril Musketeer, and then to captain...and what was waiting for me when I finally reached the top? The truth about my uncle and its cover-up! Who am I supposed to believe now!?${prompt}
  8907: '...Are you done whining, Captain?${prompt}'
  8908: What...?${prompt}
  8909: The only reason we did not inform you of what happened thirty years ago is because we thought you would react like this.${prompt}
  8910: |-
    And look at yourself... Exactly what we expected.
    Or maybe you want us to sit with you and cry over your cursed destiny?${prompt}
  8911: You want us to comfort you and tell you that what happened thirty years ago has nothing to do with the present? Will that make you feel better?${prompt}
  8912: It seems that I have overestimated your ability as captain, Volker.${prompt}
  8913: Karst! That wasn't necessary!${prompt}
  8914: You are no longer of any worth to Bastok. Iron Eater will take your place until we appoint a new captain. Now leave this office.${prompt}
  8915: President Karst!${prompt}
  8916: And while you're gone, why don't you try finding Zeid and bringing him back to Bastok? He'd be a lot more useful around here than you.${prompt}
  8917: |-
    Understood.
    I will obey your orders.${prompt}
  8918: Captain!${prompt}
  8919: It's all... It's all my fault. I should have told him a long time ago...${prompt}
  8920: Hmph! If he couldn't handle that, then he certainly cannot handle the position of captain.${prompt}
  8921: ${name-player}! You heard what just transpired here. I have a feeling that Zeid's letter was just a ploy to get Volker to meet him.${prompt}
  8922: However, by the looks of him, I'm not positive that Volker is ready to meet Zeid's challenge.${prompt}
  8923: But we cannot wait for Volker to come to terms with the truth that lies before him. That's why I'm asking you to go capture the dark knight and bring him here.${prompt}
  8924: Whether I make him Volker's replacement or throw him in jail is up to me.${prompt}
  8925: President Karst! You cannot do this! Think of what both have done for this country!${prompt}
  8926: That's right, Karst! You're not the type to let your feelings control your actions!${prompt}
  8927: |-
    I've...
    I've given my orders and I'm not repeating myself.${prompt}
  8928: Zeid has much popularity among our soldiers' ranks. And that is why I cannot allow this investigation to be headed up by the Musketeers.${prompt}
  8929: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You were successful in defeating the Shadow Lord. I'm entrusting this next task to you.${prompt}
  8930: Now be off with you. Your destination is Castle Zvahl!${prompt}
  8931: Welcome back from Castle Zvahl. You may enter.${prompt}
  8932: Now that you're all here, I have just one question to ask... Why can't you Mythril Musketeers ever follow orders!?${prompt}
  8933: I thought I told you to bring Zeid back here to Bastok!${prompt}
  8934: And because you couldn't complete a simple task, what am I left to do? Reinstate this failure of a soldier as captain!?${prompt}
  8935: President Karst...${prompt}
  8936: |-
    I've heard enough. Leave my office.
    Find something suitable for the adventurer's reward.${prompt}
  8937: Do you think the president's mad because of us?${prompt}
  8938: You've got it backwards, Naji. I haven't seen him this happy in ages.${prompt}
  8939: Ha ha. That man never could show his true feelings.${prompt}
  8940: I thought that we might be punished more severely...${prompt}
  8941: Oh, do not worry, sir. Knowing the president, I am sure we will be getting a pay cut, or something of the like.${prompt}
  8942: A pay cut!? C'mon! I still have sixteen more payments on my loan...${prompt}
  8943: Don't tell me you bought another sword...${prompt}
  8944: I... I don't know how to thank all of you.${prompt}
  8945: I can never be Zeid. I don't have the strength to carry the burdens that he does.${prompt}
  8946: However, I have come to realize that there are some things that only I can accomplish.${prompt}
  8947: While there are many truths that can be seen while within the boundaries of a nation, there are some things that can only be viewed once one has left their native soil.${prompt}
  8948: That is why adventurers such as yourself are of great importance to our country.${prompt}
  8949: 'This is your reward, ${name-player}. And with it I present to you our nation''s highest honor: rank 10.${prompt}'
  8950: I cannot begin to count the number of times I have thanked you for your services, but...thank you.${prompt}
  8951: Some ${choice-player-gender}[guys/girls] have all the luck... You? You get a reward. Me? I get a pay cut!${prompt}
  8952: Oh yeah, I almost forgot. There's a letter for you.${prompt}
  8953: Here. You'll know who it's from when you read it.${prompt}
  8954: |-
    Dear ${name-player},${wait-36: 1}
    “Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt}
  8955: |-
    I...
    I hated my country.${prompt}
  8956: |-
    A country ruled by gil...
    A country where people don't care about anyone but themselves...${prompt}
  8957: I tried to change it, but with each passing day, I came to think that maybe I really was powerless against the system.${prompt}
  8958: But recently I've met a lot of different people, and I've come to realize that I'm not as powerless as I thought.${prompt}
  8959: And that's why I've decided to listen to the voice of the people and ask them, “Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt}
  8960: As a matter of fact, I've already started asking. Here's what they had to say...${prompt}
  8961: You sure do ask the strangest things, Cornelia.${prompt}
  8962: |-
    Hmmm, well...
    I haven't had the easiest life here in Bastok, but I don't think I could have pursued my dream anywhere else.${prompt}
  8963: It may sound strange, but being in this country gives you the confidence to tell everybody, “I'll show you!”${prompt}
  8964: Of course. I am proud to say that I was born and raised in Bastok.${prompt}
  8965: Even though we are surrounded by malms of desert, I can still get all the ingredients I need for my family's meals.${prompt}
  8966: I think that this can only come from the freedom that this nation is built on.${prompt}
  8967: Some may criticize the money-hungry ways of the merchants and adventurers, but without them, where would Bastok be today?${prompt}
  8968: My only trouble is trying to decide what to make for dinner. I'd say that is a fairly carefree life.${prompt}
  8969: What the hell kind of question is that? How could I like a country where Humes have stepped on us Galka for hundreds of years!?${prompt}
  8970: The bridge between our people cannot be built in a day. But if we do not try, the spirits of our ancestors can never rest.${prompt}
  8971: Everyone knows we must change our ways, but that is often easier said than done.${prompt}
  8972: Love, hate... Does it really matter?${prompt}
  8973: But when people try to live their lives without taking the rules that have been laid down before them, there are bound to be some problems.${prompt}
  8974: I guess that's what you call “responsibility.” You know, that word wasn't used that much by the ancient Galka.${prompt}
  8975: Nobody really questioned the responsibility of the Talekeeper, just as no one really questions the responsibility of the gods.${prompt}
  8976: If you are going to leave everything up to one person, responsibility is obsolete. However, if you try living in a community...${prompt}
  8977: Now, if you, too, would start taking some responsibility...${prompt}
  8978: Hey, you don't have to get that upset...!${prompt}
  8979: If I had no feelings for this country, I would probably still be refining my skills in Norg...${prompt}
  8980: But I feel that it is my duty to protect this nation. It may sound simple, but it is what drives me.${prompt}
  8981: I just wanted a place where I could conduct my experiments...${prompt}
  8982: I never thought they would make me so important. Ha ha.${prompt}
  8983: The only thing I need out of life is the opportunity to give something back to the people...${prompt}
  8984: Sure, I like Bastok. Where else could a guy like me become a Musketeer? This is the land of opportunity!${prompt}
  8985: Now if they would just cut back my hours and give me a raise, I could be the star of hope for all the little children in the nation...${prompt}
  8986: As long as the enemy lurks on the outside, the battle to defend this nation must continue. And as long as the battle continues, the work for officials such as myself will never end.${prompt}
  8987: I do not think that we shall ever see a perfect Bastok, but that does not mean we should stop trying to build one.${prompt}
  8988: The day one can speak their true feelings for one's country is the day ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] realizes ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] true role there.${prompt}
  8989: With Sir Zeid away, I never stopped to think about what my role was...${prompt}
  8990: But now I have finally come to see what I must do, and I feel a step closer to being able to speak my true feelings about Bastok.${prompt}
  8991: Wh-what is that supposed to mean!? Now stop asking foolish questions and get back to your room and study!${prompt}
  8992: I love this country from the bottom of my heart. Sharing the pain, and the joy...${prompt}
  8993: Denying pain and forcing it on another can only cause more pain, and joy will never be achieved.${prompt}
  8994: The pain that I have suffered is the pain of all the citizens of Bastok, and I will continue my struggle until that pain has turned to happiness.${prompt}
  8995: As for me...well, I don't know if I can answer yet, but I do know this--there is a lot more of this country that I want to learn about.${prompt}
  8996: And maybe someday I can become somebody who will represent the people and bring change to Bastok. Maybe I'll even become... Wait. I'll leave that a secret.${prompt}
  8997: Just look at Captain Volker. Compared to his uncle, he's accomplished so much. If he could do it...${prompt}
  8998: I apologize for my rambling. I want to thank you again for all you have done.${prompt}
  8999: Fighting for our nation, defeating the Shadow Lord...your accomplishments have benefited Bastok so much.${prompt}
  9000: However, in addition, you have given us something more important.${prompt}
  9001: You have taught us about what we were lacking. I now know the importance of sharing our joy as well as our pain, and I will work hard to make sure I never forget.${prompt}
  9002: "Until we meet again, ${name-player}...\n \n                     Cornelia${prompt}"
  9003: I have heard the rumors, ${name-player}. People say that there are few who can match your great axe technique.${prompt}
  9004: How would you like to challenge your limits? Here, take this axe and test yourself.${prompt}
  9005: 'When you feel that the weapon can take you no further, bring it and this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} back here to me.${prompt}'
  9006: Is something wrong? Are you giving up so easily?${prompt}
  9007: |-
    What is wrong?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    I've lost the axe.
    I've decided to give up.${prompt}
  9008: |-
    And you call yourself an adventurer. You should learn to take better care of your property!
    Here, take this axe, and be more careful this time.${prompt}
  9009: Give up? After coming this far?${prompt}
  9010: |-
    Do you really want to give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not just yet.${prompt}
  9011: |-
    I see you were not ready for the task I offered you...
    Do what you wish with that axe. I have no need for it.${prompt}
  9012: Your journey is not yet over, ${name-player}. There are still many roads that this axe has to lead you down.${prompt}
  9013: So, the axe has finally recognized your true ability.${prompt}
  9014: However, your journey is not yet over. Take this and travel to the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There a great beast awaits you.${prompt}
  9015: 'Defeat that beast and retrieve from it ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} as proof of your victory.${prompt}'
  9016: Hmph... Your eyes are asking me why you must do something so tedious.${prompt}
  9017: |-
    I remember giving my master the same look when he asked me to perform this task many years ago.
    The answer to your question can only be realized by defeating that beast...${prompt}
  9018: 'I see you have brought back the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  9019: Ten years ago, before I became a Mythril Musketeer, I, too, defeated the beast and brought back that same item as proof of my deed. Just as my master had ordered me...${prompt}
  9020: Master, I do not feel that this axe is suited for me. I wish to continue my training in the way of the great sword.${prompt}
  9021: |-
    Pagdako...
    Rushing into decisions can only hamper your potential.${prompt}
  9022: That axe has shown you your limits, and has led you to reevaluate the paths you have chosen.${prompt}
  9023: |-
    Whether or not you attempt to break those limits is up to you. Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread.
    This is all I can teach you...${prompt}
  9024: Master!${prompt}
  9025: Believe in yourself and your abilities, Pagdako. A new force is growing inside you as we speak...${prompt}
  9026: 'I sensed that you, too, had begun to realize your limits. However, by fighting with that foe, a new force has begun to grow inside of you. These ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} are just a symbol of that force.${prompt}'
  9027: Step forth, and wield your axe with confidence, knowing that the path you have chosen has not ended. There is still much to learn...${prompt}
  9028: You have learned the weapon skill “Steel Cyclone”!${prompt}
  9029: Oh, ${name-player}. You're just the person I wanted to see. I've heard a lot about your skill with firearms.${prompt}
  9030: I want you to try out this new weapon we've invented. It's a mighty fine piece of work, if you ask me.${prompt}
  9031: 'Oh, I almost forgot the owner''s manual. Here it is...the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...? Who on Vana''diel gave it that name? Raibaht?${prompt}'
  9032: |-
    Well, he never did have that much in the way of imagination.
    Anyway, this lady's guaranteed to last until your grandchildren are clubbing Quadav. But if it ever stops shooting straight, bring it back to me. I'll fix her right up.${prompt}
  9033: What's wrong? My weapon didn't backfire on you, did it?${prompt}
  9034: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    No particular reason.
    I've lost the gun...
    I've had enough...${prompt}
  9035: |-
    What do you mean, “lost it”? You know that guns are for shooting, not for throwing, right?
    Oh well. Take this as a replacement, but be more careful next time!${prompt}
  9036: What are you talking about? We were just starting to get somewhere!${prompt}
  9037: |-
    You don't really want to quit, do you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I do.
    No, not really.${prompt}
  9038: |-
    Give up? Hey, it's not like I'm asking you to save the world or anything.
    <Sigh> Well, I can't force you to do anything you don't want to... But you get rid of the gun yourself, all right?${prompt}
  9039: Wait a minute, this baby still has a few more rounds in her. Take her back to the battlefield and do some more damage, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9040: So she's fired her last shot... I guess we'll have to work on improving this test model before we can start manufacturing.${prompt}
  9041: Chief, that weapon is not a test model.${prompt}
  9042: Not a test model? What do you mean, Raibaht? Come on, spill it.${prompt}
  9043: I designed that gun to be used in training exercises.${prompt}
  9044: Oh, you mean this is one of the guns we were asked to develop for... I'm sorry, ${name-player}. I seem to have given you the wrong weapon.${prompt}
  9045: While I say “training exercises,” you must know that I do not refer to the training of novices. In theory, only the top marksmen should be able to handle the power of that rifle. Which means...${prompt}
  9046: Ha ha! This is perfect! We can shoot two birds with one bullet, so to speak.${prompt}
  9047: '${name-player}, I need you to go and find me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  9048: Maybe we can use that to help train our army's soldiers.${prompt}
  9049: I've heard stories about it being hidden somewhere in the Boyahda Tree. You'll go get it for us, right?${prompt}
  9050: 'You''re back with the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}! Here, let me take a look at her...${prompt}'
  9051: Hmmm... So that's what we've been missing...${prompt}
  9052: |-
    When I was young, I used to be quite the marksman myself. However, too many hours in the lab has led me to forget all that I learned back then...
    I want to thank you for helping me to realize that, ${name-player}. The least I can do is teach you the technique described in the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  9053: You have learned the weapon skill “Detonator”!${prompt}
  9054: What're you doing in here?${prompt}
  9055: Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm waiting for someone.${prompt}
  9056: I have come, as per our agreement.${prompt}
  9057: Uh, now is not a good time. Can you come back later?${prompt}
  9058: You were the one who called me here, were you not?${prompt}
  9059: |-
    You're...
    Viresefilant...?${prompt}
  9060: |-
    Ayame?
    Long has it been since our paths last crossed. You are now a Mythril Musketeer, if I'm not mistaken?${prompt}
  9061: I was fortunate, that is all.${prompt}
  9062: There is no need to rub my nose in it, Ayame.${prompt}
  9063: That's not what I--${prompt}
  9064: Out of my way. I have better things to do.${prompt}
  9065: You know that guy?${prompt}
  9066: |-
    Yes...
    We trained together in Norg.${prompt}
  9067: We promised to always lend each other strength when the path became too hard to travel.${prompt}
  9068: I thought he would've been glad to see I had become a Mythril Musketeer...${prompt}
  9069: |-
    Well, people change. Maybe he just forgot about those times.
    You shouldn't beat yourself up over it.${prompt}
  9070: Anyway, what can I do for you? I'm kinda busy over here...${prompt}
  9071: In that case, it can wait. We'll speak later.${prompt}
  9072: Adventurer, I need to have a word with you. Could you come to the Northern Cannonry?${prompt}
  9073: I apologize for all the mystery...${prompt}
  9074: '...but I needed to speak with you in private.${prompt}'
  9075: You see...${prompt}
  9076: I have a request for you from a senator.${prompt}
  9077: He claims to have been receiving threats.${prompt}
  9078: Every day there have been mountains of incoherent, slanderous letters arriving at the President's Office. So many, in fact, the herald delivering these threats, rather than the senator himself, has collapsed from the strain.${prompt}
  9079: Now we have Naji delivering the mail, if you can imagine it.${prompt}
  9080: This interruption to our duties, not to mention Naji's complaining, has become intolerable. So I did some investigating. From the letters, I was able to discover the identity of the writer and negotiate a meeting at the Tenshodo here in Bastok. However...${prompt}
  9081: |-
    There is one small problem.
    The letter writer won't meet with anyone unless they bring a certain diary.${prompt}
  9082: This diary is supposedly hidden somewhere within the Palborough Mines. I have no idea why it would be there.${prompt}
  9083: The Mythril Musketeers are far too busy with more pressing matters to conduct a search of the mines, and we certainly can't expect the senator to go in our stead.${prompt}
  9084: |-
    This is where you come in.
    Would you be willing to take this task upon yourself?${prompt}
  9085: |-
    Will you perform this task?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, the mines are like my second home.
    I also have more pressing matters...${prompt}
  9086: |-
    I cannot entrust this task to anyone else.
    Please let me know if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9087: This is not only about the diary. You will also be required to eliminate the letter writer. I am sure your skills in combat will be tested before this matter has been put to rest.${prompt}
  9088: Show the diary to Kagetora, and he will tell you where the author of these threatening letters can be found. I leave the “negotiations” to your discretion.${prompt}
  9089: |-
    Ah, yes.
    Please do not mention any of this to Romualdo.${prompt}
  9090: Senator Alois has his suspicions.${prompt}
  9091: Apparently Romualdo has been seen in the company of some strange character as of late.${prompt}
  9092: But putting aside these speculations, there is reason to believe that someone has been providing the letter writer with information.${prompt}
  9093: It is unlikely that the writer is in direct contact with an employee of the President's Office, so I assume there must be a messenger of some sort.${prompt}
  9094: I want you to find out the identity of this messenger as well.${prompt}
  9095: |-
    Viresefilant...?
    What is going on here?
    I must speak with Senator Alois...${prompt}
  9096: What business does an adventurer have with me?${prompt}
  9097: |-
    Is that so?
    How strange, I have no memory of making any such request. The next time you see Ayame, you tell her to keep my name out of her affairs.${prompt}
  9098: Senator Alois, forgive this interruption, but there is something I need to spe--${prompt}
  9099: Can't I get any peace around here?${prompt}
  9100: Please explain to me about this new assassin group.${prompt}
  9101: Assassa-whatsits? What in Vana'diel are you babbling about?${prompt}
  9102: Save the act, Senator. Kagetora of the Tenshodo told me everything.${prompt}
  9103: Creating this fictitious “assassin” organization to lure adventurers into doing your dirty work is an abuse of power.${prompt}
  9104: I did no such thing. I just mentioned the rumor that an assassin group might exist. It's not my fault if they took things the wrong way.${prompt}
  9105: |-
    What are you trying to say exactly?
    That I have to take responsibility for other people's misunderstandings now, hmmm?${prompt}
  9106: I am already in a position of responsibility.${prompt}
  9107: I have eliminated the objective as per your orders, Senator.${prompt}
  9108: '...!!!${prompt}'
  9109: |-
    Ah! Good work, good work.
    You have carried out my request to shut up that big-mou...I mean, remove that menace to our nation most admirably.${prompt}
  9110: From now on, please inform me in advance when you intend to make a report.${prompt}
  9111: Does this mean I have been accepted into the assassins?${prompt}
  9112: There must be some sort of mistake.${prompt}
  9113: I don't know anything about any “assassins.”${prompt}
  9114: What makes you think that I would be able to authorize something like that in the first place? I believe you've taken some of my previous comments in entirely the wrong light. In the future, pay a little more attention to the details.${prompt}
  9115: And did you find out who the messenger was? I specifically ordered you to discover who was running the information back and forth.${prompt}
  9116: You expect to receive a reward when you haven't even completed your assignment? I have no patience for this kind of unprofessionalism. Get back out there at once!${prompt}
  9117: If you have any complaints, kindly make them after you have brought me the messenger!${prompt}
  9118: Senator!${prompt}
  9119: |-
    Guards!
    There is an unwelcome guest in the President's Office. Remove him immediately.${prompt}
  9120: '...${prompt}'
  9121: "Honestly, the number of ill-mannered hireswords these days just makes my head ache. \nAre you still here? Be on your way, adventurer.${prompt}"
  9122: |-
    What is the meaning of this, Senator?
    That exchange appeared to be more than just a simple “misunderstanding.”
    You promised him a position as an assassin, didn't you?${prompt}
  9123: Your actions in this matter are reprehensible. You enlisted his services because of his exceptional skill, correct?${prompt}
  9124: That level of ability is not something gained over a weekend training session. Do you have any idea of the sweat and tears one must go through to attain such perfection!?${prompt}
  9125: What is that to me?${prompt}
  9126: |-
    Well, I know exactly what he has gone through.
    The toil and the blisters of constant practice. Swinging a katana until his arm was numb from the strain. Encouraging others to push on, even though he himself was ready to drop.${prompt}
  9127: Even if I don't know everything about him, I know that much. You will apologize for manipulating him and making a mockery of his effort.${prompt}
  9128: '...${prompt}'
  9129: Senator...${prompt}
  9130: Huh...?${prompt}
  9131: I've had about enough of your lecturing. If you're done whining, I'm sure you have other duties to attend to. Now get out!${prompt}
  9132: |-
    If that is the way it must be.
    I'll take my leave.${prompt}
  9133: ${name-player}, would you accompany me, please?${prompt}
  9134: |-
    I suppose you're thinking of crying to the president about this?
    What a pity he's far too busy to make time for the likes of you.${prompt}
  9135: I am a patient woman...${prompt}
  9136: |-
    Guards!
    This adventurer is to be banned from entering the Metalworks, effective immediately!${prompt}
  9137: Your methods lack subtlety.${prompt}
  9138: Who asked for your opinion!? Get out!${prompt}
  9139: Senator Alois, could you spare a moment?${prompt}
  9140: Who is this man?${prompt}
  9141: This is the messenger you've been searching for.${prompt}
  9142: |-
    Please forgive me.
    I was the one who tricked Romualdo into revealing sensitive information about you, sir.${prompt}
  9143: Seems he was ready to sell information to other citizens who hold grudges against you as well. We were lucky this business was restricted to just one malcontent.${prompt}
  9144: |-
    Unbelievable.
    Well then, lad, excellent work. I'll be able to sleep much easier tonight.${prompt}
  9145: That's the kind of efficiency I've come to expect from the Mythril Musketeers.${prompt}
  9146: Actually, it wasn't me who caught him, sir. It was the man you ordered me to remove from the office a little while ago.${prompt}
  9147: Sir, you did mention you would hear what he had to say if he brought you the messenger. You really should listen to him.${prompt}
  9148: The thing is, though, he's already left the Republic. Fed up with the treatment he's received, I'd imagine. So I'll do his talking for him.${prompt}
  9149: There was only one thing he wished to say to you.${prompt}
  9150: “Be ashamed of your actions.”${prompt}
  9151: How dare a simple citizen speak that way to a senator!${prompt}
  9152: |-
    We-ell...
    I suppose it's about time I took this fellow before the president and had him confess to his crimes. You don't mind, do you? After all, it is my duty.${prompt}
  9153: |-
    President Karst is so intimidating...
    I'd just break down and tell him everything.${prompt}
  9154: I...${prompt}
  9155: '...All right. I will never do anything like this again. I swear it.${prompt}'
  9156: Ayame, got a minute?${prompt}
  9157: There was one more message I had to deliver.${prompt}
  9158: From Viresefilant?${prompt}
  9159: |-
    The promise you both made that day...
    He kept that promise to look out for you.${prompt}
  9160: He remembered...${prompt}
  9161: Okay, time for me to go. I'm no good at this sappy stuff.${prompt}
  9162: |-
    I owe my thanks to you as well.
    Please take this with my gratitude.${prompt}
  9163: May fortune smile upon your future endeavors, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9164: |-
    Good day, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].
    I am with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (AMAN) and am now taking applications for new ${color: 5}mentors${color: 1}.${prompt}
  9165: |-
    What is a mentor, you ask?
    Well, in short, a mentor is an experienced adventurer who is willing to offer some of their time to help out their less traveled companions.${prompt}
  9166: If this sounds like the job for you, then feel free to sign up today.${prompt}
  9167: 'To become a mentor, you must have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  9168: 'Accepting ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} requires that you have over 180 hours of play time...${prompt}'
  9169: '...and have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082828080}.${prompt}'
  9170: Please note that registering and serving as a mentor, as well as utilizing the services of the Mentor Program, are to be done at the player's own discretion.${prompt}
  9171: SQUARE ENIX will not be held responsible for the actions and/or comments of any mentors. No benefits of any kind will be provided to those who choose to participate in the Mentor Program.${prompt}
  9172: When you agree to participate in the Mentor Program, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood the above terms.${prompt}
  9173: 'I am sorry, but you do not meet the requirements necessary to accept the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  9174: 'Please speak to me again once you have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}. I will then judge whether or not you meet the requirements.${prompt}'
  9175: 'You have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, yes? Then let me check my materials here...${prompt}'
  9176: Congratulations! You are qualified to be a mentor!${prompt}
  9177: My materials here say that you don't meet the requirements. Keep at it!${prompt}
  9178: |-
    Would you like to serve as a mentor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9179: You are now a registered mentor.${prompt}
  9180: |-
    You can enable "Mentor Status" by using the command ${color: 5}/mentor on${color: 1}.
    You can disable the status by using ${color: 5}/mentor off${color: 1}.${prompt}
  9181: Mentor status can also be switched on and off in the “Config” menu found within the “Help Desk.”${prompt}
  9182: You are already a registered mentor.${prompt}
  9183: '${color-alt: 138}A new objective, ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, has been added to Records of Eminence.'
  9184: |-
    ${name-player}!
    So you, too, have decided to join the Bastokan forces and participate in Conflict!${prompt}
  9185: Ha ha! Do not tell me you are worried about those cowards to the east or those arrogant fools to the north. They will be no match for the strength of our nation. Now let us go and report to the president.${prompt}
  9186: |-
    Sir!
    I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...${prompt}
  9187: What in Altana's name was that Volker thinking!? Agreeing to the reinstatement of Conflict... Why am I forced to work with complete idiots!?${prompt}
  9188: Sir, Captain Volker was only thinking of the Republican Army when he made his decision. Conflict would give our forces a boost in morale, as well as sharpen their skills.${prompt}
  9189: And I'm saying that his way of thinking is flawed and outdated! Why waste our funds on children's games when that gil could be used to develop new weapons!${prompt}
  9190: Sir, are you saying that our country would not profit from Conflict...?${prompt}
  9191: And what would a Mythril Musketeer know about profit!? That profit is what fills your cupboards with brown bread and rocksalt.${prompt}
  9192: Don't you tell me how to run my country!  It is my job to decide what will and will not benefit this nation.${prompt}
  9193: |-
    Listen up, because I'm only going to say this once.
    Conflict is nothing but a series of war games. We are not allowed to even test our new ships or cannons.${prompt}
  9194: No! The exercises must be won with well-planned tactics. In the field of battle tactics, there isn't a nation in all of Vana'diel that can outmatch our generals. There is no reason for us to have to prove that.${prompt}
  9195: |-
    San d'Oria? Hah!
    Let them line up in their little lines and charge with their wooden spears.${prompt}
  9196: Don't forget that it wasn't only our cannons that delivered them defeat during the Battle of Konschtat.${prompt}
  9197: |-
    And Windurst? Hah!
    Those cowards don't even know how to fight! Hiding behind hired mercenaries, muttering spells doesn't win campaigns.${prompt}
  9198: It didn't work in Elshimo and it won't work this time, either! They should all just crawl up in their big tree and hibernate for the winter.${prompt}
  9199: The ages of strength and magic are over.${prompt}
  9200: San d'Oria and Windurst have the tools they need to win, but they don't have the brains to use them! Our citizens do. And that's why we will always be victorious!${prompt}
  9201: Sir, this adventurer...${prompt}
  9202: |-
    You want my approval to fight in Conflict, citizen? You have it!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  9203: I apologize for the president's behavior. While he is vocal in his opposition to Bastok's participation in Conflict, the last thing he wishes is the Republic's defeat.${prompt}
  9204: |-
    Hmmm...
    So, you are here from ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] to receive permission to participate in Conflict?${prompt}
  9205: '...${prompt}'
  9206: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    I apologize if I look shocked, but I expected more from ${choice: 0}[the once mighty lions of San d'Oria/the once mighty magicians of the Federation]...${prompt}
  9207: |-
    Well, no matter.
    Follow me. We must not keep the president waiting.${prompt}
  9208: |-
    Sir!
    I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...${prompt}
  9209: |-
    I have a question for you, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].
    Why did you pledge your allegiance to ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] and not to Bastok?${prompt}
  9210: |-
    You chose ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] because of...
    ${selection-lines}
    ...its people.
    ...its culture.
    ...its city.
    ...its leader.${prompt}
  9211: |-
    Its people?
    The helpless masses whining for a hero to hold their hands when things get tough?
    The petty common folk, blind to their own worthlessness?
    Did you really think that you could be their hero?${prompt}
  9212: |-
    San d'Oria's culture?
    You mean their stubborn pride? Or perhaps the blatant ostentation found in their castles and cathedrals?
    But, tell me. Can a well-decorated chateau feed the hungry masses!?${prompt}
  9213: |-
    Windurst's culture?
    Yes, magic is good for talent shows and birthday parties, but can an incantation feed your nation's starving people!?${prompt}
  9214: |-
    Its city?
    Have you spent even a second to think of what the people of your nation had to give to build that city for its leaders? Years of sweat and blood...and for what? Can a fancy bridge or beautiful fountain feed the hungry masses!?${prompt}
  9215: |-
    San d'Oria's leader?
    You don't mean that decrepit old man who spends his days snoring on the throne, do you? Or maybe you meant those bickering brothers? Yes, all of them make wonderful leaders.${prompt}
  9216: |-
    Windurst's leader?
    Yes, I'd love to be Windurst's leader. All I'd have to do all day is hide up in my treehouse and have my maids take out the garbage.${prompt}
  9217: Oh, but don't let me tell you what is right or just.${prompt}
  9218: 'All you have to remember is that the wheels of change began turning back during the ${choice: 0}[Battle of Konschtat/Elshimo Campaign].${prompt}'
  9219: You have my permission to participate in Conflict, but don't forget that a new age is upon us, and Bastok is at the reigns.${prompt}
  9220: |-
    Of course, there's always the option of naturalization. The officers at the Department of Industry would be more than delighted to take your application.
    You're dismissed!${prompt}
  9221: |-
    What is wrong? Were you offended by what the president had to say?
    Well, I can offer you no apologies. According to my sources, your nation's leaders are just as vocal with their opinions of the Republic.
    If you have any complaints, I suggest you settle them on the battlefield.${prompt}
  9222: There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt}
  9223: You hear a voice from out of nowhere...${prompt}
  9224: 'You obtain ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  9225: |-
    ...
    At last we meet.${prompt}
  9226: I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.${prompt}
  9227: Wait, there is something I must...${prompt}
  9228: This place is...?${prompt}
  9229: |-
    I see...
    You must be the new wielder for these.${prompt}
  9230: 'Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9231: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.${prompt}'
  9232: |-
    They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my...
    Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....${prompt}
  9233: '...${prompt}'
  9234: I hope you don't think this is the end.${prompt}
  9235: |-
    Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning.
    Time to start your training anew!${prompt}
  9236: |-
    ...
    Finally! We finally meet face to face!${prompt}
  9237: |-
    I have a presence in this world again!
    What an exhilarating feeling!${prompt}
  9238: Ah yes, there is one more thing...${prompt}
  9239: Eh? What?${prompt}
  9240: |-
    Oh.
    You must be this one's new owner.${prompt}
  9241: 'With your dagger skills, you''ll make a perfect wielder for the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9242: It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.${prompt}
  9243: Treat her well...${prompt}
  9244: '...${prompt}'
  9245: |-
    Splendid!
    From this day forth, I belong to you.${prompt}
  9246: |-
    So, what kind of games shall we play?
    And where shall we go to play them?
    Who are we going to kill when we get there?
    It's all just too exciting...!${prompt}
  9247: |-
    ...
    Thou hast found me.${prompt}
  9248: I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.${prompt}
  9249: A moment...${prompt}
  9250: |-
    ...
    What has happened to me?${prompt}
  9251: I see, you are the sword's new owner?${prompt}
  9252: |-
    Well, this is most encouraging!
    A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9253: |-
    When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it.
    It is yours...
    Restore order to Vana'diel!${prompt}
  9254: And now I, too, can rest unburdened...${prompt}
  9255: '...${prompt}'
  9256: Thou art blessed this day.${prompt}
  9257: |-
    Henceforth, I shall be thy blade.
    For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...${prompt}
  9258: |-
    ...
    You have found me.${prompt}
  9259: |-
    Allow me to show my respect.
    You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.${prompt}
  9260: But first...${prompt}
  9261: Who are you?${prompt}
  9262: |-
    This must be some sort of joke.
    You are the new wielder of this weapon?${prompt}
  9263: |-
    Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you.
    With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.${prompt}
  9264: However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.${prompt}
  9265: |-
    Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind.
    My regards go with you, stranger...${prompt}
  9266: '...${prompt}'
  9267: Now, my heroic master...${prompt}
  9268: |-
    For what purpose will you wield my power?
    The choices before you are without limit.
    Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...${prompt}
  9269: |-
    ...
    You...me, meet.${prompt}
  9270: |-
    Me...free...
    Thanks to you. Me, your...${prompt}
  9271: Wait...${prompt}
  9272: What the...?${prompt}
  9273: |-
    Ah, now I see.
    The wheel has turned.${prompt}

  9374: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  9375: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  9376: '...${prompt}'
  9377: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}

    I am saved.${prompt}

  9438: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9439: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9440: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9441: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9442: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9443: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9444: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9445: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9446: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9447: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9448: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9449: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9450: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9451: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9452: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9453: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9454: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9455: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9456: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9457: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}

  9465: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  9466: |-
    Well, that was exciting...
    Hm? You're looking for that rude and crude little girl?${prompt}
  9467: |-
    Well, why didn't you say so!?
    We thought she might go causing trouble, so...${prompt}
  9468: So we threw the vagrant into one of our holding cells.${prompt}
  9469: |-
    Lady Cornelia has been keeping the girl company.
    Master Cid, have you sustained any injuries?${prompt}
  9470: |-
    I'm fine. I'm fine.
    But it's our little guest that I'm worried about. She seems pretty confused and upset. I was going to let her rest a while before I tried talking to her.${prompt}
  9471: Oh, don't worry. She hasn't done anything wrong, and there are no plans of punishing her any further.${prompt}
  9472: |-
    She'll be let go once we've sorted a few things out...
    Do you know what she was yelling about earlier?${prompt}
  9473: All this nonsense about airships and Wyrmkings... I couldn't make heads or tails of it...${prompt}
  9474: |-
    What!?
    Armored airships?
    Hooded scientists?${prompt}
  9475: |-
    Well...
    The scientists are probably the ones from Jeuno.
    As for the airships, all I can think is that they might be the ones modified for battle during the Great War. But that project was canceled after the allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord's armies.${prompt}
  9476: I know because I was a member of the project!${prompt}
  9477: Twenty years ago, I get this invitation from the duke himself to work on a secret project for the Duchy. Minus myself and a few other scientists from Windurst, all the rest of the people assigned to the project are these creepy, pale-faced men in dark, hooded robes.${prompt}
  9478: They rarely showed their faces in public, but from what I saw, the knowledge and technology they possessed was far superior to anything I had ever seen anywhere on Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9479: Why, the “crystal propulsion unit” that they had developed was years ahead of its time.${prompt}
  9480: But it required an energy source more powerful than that which the eight elemental crystals found on Vana'diel could provide.${prompt}
  9481: What were the Jeunoan scientists using to power their unit, and where did they discover that power?${prompt}
  9482: I was determined to find out, so I started watching them every chance I got.${prompt}
  9483: 'It wasn''t long before I noticed that they were conducting a lot of strange experiments around the Crag of ${choice: 0}[Holla/Dem/Mea], but I couldn''t put my finger on exactly what they were doing...${prompt}'
  9484: And now they've restarted the project! But why are they sending the airships to Tavnazia...?${prompt}
  9485: To catch Bahamut, that's why!${prompt}
  9486: '!?${prompt}'
  9487: |-
    Cid, this is Prishe. She's feeling much better than she was before.
    I think she's ready to talk.${prompt}
  9488: |-
    Thanks, Cornelia.
    So, Prishe. First, let me apologize for keeping you locked up for so long. No hard feelings, alright?
    But I need you to tell me, who is this Bahamut you keep talking about?${prompt}
  9489: Oh, you mean the Wyrmking. Well, everything was all fine and dandy until one day, all of a sudden, this huge dragon appears over my hometown.${prompt}
  9490: We were going to meet this dragon and try to knock some sense into him when out of nowhere, a huge airship contraption with all these guns and cannons flies up.${prompt}
  9491: We were right in the middle of giving the guys from that ship a sound beating until poof, I'm warped to this hellhole.${prompt}
  9492: |-
    What!?
    You were actually fighting against the Duchy?${prompt}
  9493: Hey, we weren't just going to sit there and let them kill Bahamut! Anyway, it was Jeuno who took the first shots.${prompt}
  9494: If I only had a little more time, I could have found out what the Wyrmking meant when he was talking about the Keeper of the Apocalypse...${prompt}
  9495: |-
    Keeper of the Apocalypse...
    I've heard that name somewhere before...${prompt}
  9496: |-
    Hmmm...
    I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I can sense that something big is going down.${prompt}
  9497: At the same time that the Telepoint at Dem shattered, I heard a report of a giant dragon appearing over the sea north of Jeuno.${prompt}
  9498: If that dragon was actually Bahamut, then we can conclude that the two events are in some way connected.${prompt}
  9499: |-
    Then that's all the more reason to get back to Riverne and try meeting with the Wyrmking one more time!
    C'mon, let's head for Jeuno!${prompt}
  9500: Jeuno? After all that's happened, why would you want to go there?${prompt}
  9501: I've got an old friend who works at the Tenshodo. If I ask him, he'll be more than happy to ready a boat back to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9502: Well, I'll be seeing you guys around! Thanks for all the hospitality!
  9503: |-
    Hey, wait!
    How do you plan on traveling to Jeuno? Do you even know how far it is!?${prompt}
  9504: |-
    Bahamut...
    Tavnazia...${prompt}
  9505: My ears still doubt the conversation I just heard. Could it all be true?${prompt}
  9506: I guess the only way to find out would be to tag along with that Prishe a little while longer. She said she was going to Jeuno to meet a friend... Who do you suppose she knows in the Duchy?${prompt}
  9507: The Multinational Expedition? Yeah, I remember reading about that in grade school, but if you want details, you'll have to ask someone a little bit older.${prompt}
  9508: |-
    Chief Cid's pretty old...
    Uh-oh... You don't go telling him I said that, okay?${prompt}
  9509: You will find there are not many people who are willing to speak of the Multinational Expedition.${prompt}
  9510: Especially among us Galka...${prompt}
  9511: What, you want to hear about the Multinational Expedition?${prompt}
  9512: What is there to know? Everybody that went on that damned mission passed away or was...${prompt}
  9513: I usually don't believe in anything crazy like magic or curses, but after hearing the stories about what happened up there in the Northlands, I don't think there may be any other explanation.${prompt}
  9514: You already heard from the other two nations that the expedition was formed on the suggestion of the Republic, right?${prompt}
  9515: |-
    <Sigh>
    Maybe it's time that I face up to my past crimes...
    I was the one that pressured the government into sending a party to the Northlands.${prompt}
  9516: Thirty years ago, a man brought a strange stone to the Metalworks.${prompt}
  9517: It wasn't any bigger than my fist, but just by standing near it you could feel the power flowing from its facets.${prompt}
  9518: That power was greater than that of any crystal I had ever seen. I was shocked and amazed by what lay before my eyes.${prompt}
  9519: When the man told me that it was a fragment of a crystal that was found in the Northlands, I was convinced that something more was hiding up there.${prompt}
  9520: I thought if I could find that energy source and bring it back to Bastok, the Republic would thrive, ultimately becoming the strongest, most advanced nation in the world.${prompt}
  9521: So I told my discovery to the president at the time, and suggested that he ready an expedition led by a party of musketeers.${prompt}
  9522: It was supposed to be top-secret, but somehow the information leaked to the other two nations, and...${prompt}
  9523: And in the end, the expedition turned up nothing, and we lost more than we could ever have imagined...${prompt}
  9524: Now that I think of it, the energy from that stone might have been enough to power the crystal propulsion unit.${prompt}
  9525: Could Jeuno have already found a new source of energy in the Northlands?${prompt}
  9526: |-
    If I only had that rock...
    Unfortunately, it disappeared thirty years ago...right around the time of the expedition.${prompt}
  9527: The man who sold me the stone--a stone which he called “magicite”--said that he brought it from Tavnazia, and that it was a piece of a larger gem known as the “Star of Tavnazia.”${prompt}
  9528: Maybe that crazy blue-haired girl from the island knows something about that gem.${prompt}
  9529: Do you think you could ask her for me?${prompt}
  9530: So you have a piece of the magicite as well...${prompt}
  9531: It looks similar to the one I saw before, but I don't feel the same kind of power flowing from it.${prompt}
  9532: No, the one I saw was pitch-black and so powerful that you could feel its energy from over twenty yalms away.${prompt}
  9533: The Multinational Expedition held thirty years ago all started when a shard of the fabled “Star of Tavnazia” was brought to the Republic.${prompt}
  9534: It was rumored that the gem was originally found in the Northlands, and that is why the party headed there first.${prompt}
  9535: If you ask one of your Tavnazian friends about the star, you might be able to learn something interesting.${prompt}
  9536: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}.
    What are you doing here?${prompt}
  9537: |-
    I heard that you went back to Tavnazia.
    Did you already meet up with Louverance?${prompt}
  9538: ${name-player}! How did you get off the island!?${prompt}
  9539: Ah! It's Cid!${prompt}
  9540: Prishe? Do you know this man?${prompt}
  9541: '...${prompt}'
  9542: Master Cid. We were able to return earlier than first planned.${prompt}
  9543: I must thank you again for allowing us to borrow such a wonderful bird. The airship has been handed over to the good men at the port.${prompt}

  9548: Ha ha ha! You've got it wrong there, Louverance. You were lucky to meet me when you did.${prompt}

  9551: The first...?${prompt}
  9552: So, did you all find this Cardinal Mildaurion you were looking for in Tavnazia?${prompt}
  9553: Unfortunately, no. The cardinal has not been back to the archipelago...${prompt}
  9554: I was able to retrieve valuable information on her past from these two young ladies, but I am no closer to grasping her whereabouts.${prompt}
  9555: |-
    Hmm... That's not good...
    What about the magicite? Were you able to find out anything for me?${prompt}
  9556: Actually, I did learn something very intriguing. However...this is not a good place...${prompt}
  9557: Did you say magicite?${prompt}
  9558: |-
    You heard me right.
    ${name-player}, you said you were looking for some, too, right?${prompt}
  9559: I was hoping that you could join me when Louverance tells his story about Tavnazia's magicite.${prompt}
  9560: But first, why don't you tell everybody what we know about the energy source in the Northlands?${prompt}
  9561: |-
    Tell them what you know?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9562: ${name-player}! We will not take no for an answer!${prompt}
  9563: |-
    I see...
    So you have been following the advice of Esha'ntarl, traveling to the three nations of San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst to gather information on the Multinational Expedition.${prompt}
  9564: If we can discover where the Tavnazian magicite brought to Bastok originated, then we will discover the final destination of our journey!${prompt}
  9565: True, but after I told ${name-player} what I knew about the dark gem, I did a little more research on my own. When I asked an old friend about the subject, he told me something quite interesting.${prompt}
  9566: My magicite wasn't found lying around in the Northlands, but inside a strange relic that was brought back from the Northlands.${prompt}
  9567: A strange relic?${prompt}
  9568: Yes, some kind of strange box.${prompt}
  9569: According to the priests of Tavnazia, the ancients made the box from some unidentifiable metal--just like the kind used in the Crag of Dem.${prompt}
  9570: That sounds like...the baptismal vessel...${prompt}
  9571: Baptismal vessel? Prishe, do you know something about this box?${prompt}
  9572: Of course. The Tavnazian theologians used that box when performing the baptism ceremony.${prompt}
  9573: It should still be in the Sacrarium's tabernacle. I'd know because I'm the only one who has a key to that place. I've been protecting the key ever since before the Great War--on Miss Mildaurion's orders!${prompt}
  9574: |-
    The baptism ceremony...?
    Then Prishe's accident was...?${prompt}
  9575: |-
    Yes, why didn't I see it before?
    Even though you were deemed the abhorrent one, you still took part in the theologians' baptism!${prompt}
  9576: |-
    Then let me tell you this.
    While in Tavnazia, I attempted to investigate the “baptismal vessel” for Master Cid.${prompt}
  9577: However, I was forced to abandon my investigation before I even began. Just days before I arrived, an officer of the Duchy, Nag'molada, broke into the Sacrarium and stole the relic.${prompt}
  9578: The vessel was stolen!?${prompt}
  9579: |-
    It's those hooded bastards from Jeuno!
    They must have learned that I was searching for the origins of the black magicite, and stole the box so I couldn't get my hands on it!${prompt}
  9580: I was so close! Now I'll never learn its secrets!${prompt}
  9581: |-
    Wait a minute...
    Prishe, you said you knew about the box. What can you tell us? Even the smallest bit of info could help.${prompt}
  9582: The vessel's evil. It changed my life. Dragged me to hell and back...${prompt}
  9583: Prishe?${prompt}
  9584: We have to get the vessel out of Nag'molada's hands! It belongs in Tavnazia!${prompt}
  9585: Prishe! Wait!${prompt}
  9586: Prishe! You cannot keep going off on your own! It is too dangerous!${prompt}
  9587: ${name-player}, you mentioned that you and Tenzen had made arrangements to meet Nag'molada in the northwestern tower of Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  9588: |-
    A great energy in the Northlands...
    While not necessarily relevant to my current mission, I am intrigued...on a personal level...${prompt}
  9589: I will be waiting for you in Beaucedine, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  9590: Well, this doesn't look good now, does it? ${name-player}, you should probably try to catch up with your companions ASAP.${prompt}
  9591: Me? I'll keep trying to find out more on the magicite. I've still got a few cards up my sleeve.${prompt}
  9592: |-
    This “baptismal vessel...”
    Now, if I could get my hands on that, just think of the advancements the Republic could make...${prompt}
  9593: |-
    ${name-player}!
    You need to hurry to the northwestern tower of Pso'Xja.
    I'll stay here and keep trying to find out more on the magicite. I've still got a few cards up my sleeve.${prompt}
  9594: ${name-player}! I was starting to worry about you! Are you all right?${prompt}
  9595: I heard from Louverance that you weren't able to get the box back, but at least you're in one piece. Somebody up there is smiling down on you, that's for sure.${prompt}
  9596: Master Cid... Ah, and ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9597: I commend you adventurers on your efficient methods of transportation.${prompt}
  9598: After our ordeal, Tenzen and Ulmia made it back safe to San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9599: However, there are still no signs of Prishe...${prompt}
  9600: We can only pray that she was as resourceful as ${name-player} here in escaping from the glacier.${prompt}
  9601: |-
    Well, I have some bad news for you...
    A communications has just been sent out to all three nations from Jeuno... Prishe is wanted on criminal charges. The Duchy has issued a warrant for her immediate arrest.${prompt}
  9602: That is preposterous!${prompt}
  9603: When Prishe sang her song, Selh'teus was able to escape... Nag'molada believes that Prishe and the boy are working together!${prompt}
  9604: |-
    Prishe's song...
    The fourth verse of the “Memoria de la S^tona”... But where did she learn it?${prompt}
  9605: |-
    I do not know...
    But one thing is for certain: We must find Prishe before Jeuno does!${prompt}
  9606: We then can ask her of the song and of the Keeper of the Apocalypse...${prompt}
  9607: |-
    Yes, and of Bahamut.
    What was she trying to tell us...?${prompt}
  9608: |-
    How to break the pact with the Wyrmking...?
    How to remonstrate against his actions...?${prompt}
  9609: |-
    The pact...
    When the Keeper of the Apocalypse arrives, Bahamut shall destroy mankind...${prompt}
  9610: |-
    Destroy mankind!?
    You mean to tell me the conqueror of the skies, Bahamut, is planning a mass genocide?${prompt}
  9611: Unfortunately, yes. And as far as we know, the Keeper of the Apocalypse has already arrived...in the form of the boy Selh'teus.${prompt}
  9612: Sent by the ancients from the celestial capital of Al'Taieu, Selh'teus's coming is foretold in mankind's pact with Bahamut--and that is why Bahamut, too, has awoken.${prompt}
  9613: And now the Wyrmking has begun calling upon his slumbering minions--he is forming an army to fulfill the pact.${prompt}
  9614: We traveled to the den of the terrestrial avatar. However, he would not listen to our pleas.${prompt}
  9615: His heart is stained with anger and there is no way to cleanse it.${prompt}
  9616: That is why the only option left before us is to somehow break the pact... But how...?${prompt}
  9617: Break the pact... Hmmm...${prompt}
  9618: |-
    This can't be that hard...
    Let's think about it...
    Keeper comes...Bahamut wipes out mankind...${prompt}
  9619: |-
    Keeper comes...
    Bahamut wipes out mankind...${prompt}
  9620: |-
    Keeper comes...
    Bahamut...${prompt}
  9621: |-
    Wait a minute! That's it!
    What if the Keeper of the Apocalypse never comes?${prompt}
  9622: |-
    ...!
    Then Bahamut would not have to...${prompt}
  9623: I don't know if this is what Prishe was trying to say, but if we can do something about the keeper, Bahamut won't have any pact to fulfill! Vana'diel will be saved!${prompt}
  9624: The problem is finding this keeper...${prompt}
  9625: |-
    But we already know who he is! The Keeper of the Apocalypse is Selh'teus!
    Capturing the boy has been our mission from the start!${prompt}
  9626: It may be a nearly impossible task, but if we had the assistance of Carbuncle, bringer of rainbows...${prompt}
  9627: |-
    Tenzen!
    If it is all right, I would like to try and locate Prishe.${prompt}
  9628: Prishe has the ability to communicate with Selh'teus. Perhaps she knows something that we have yet to realize!${prompt}
  9629: I am going to further investigate the celestial capital of Al'Taieu. If this is where the boy came from, then there must be a path to return there.${prompt}
  9630: Splitting up into three groups to find information on Prishe and the keeper... Why didn't I think of that!?${prompt}
  9631: So what are you going to do, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9632: |-
    I'm going to...
    ${selection-lines}
    Investigate Al'Taieu.
    Find Selh'teus.
    Find Prishe.${prompt}
  9633: Louverance...${prompt}
  9634: I plan on traveling to Tavnazia to further investigate the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  9635: It was the Tavnazian Cathedral that brought this name back from obscurity, and it is more than likely the place that the Cardinal Mildaurion seeks out.${prompt}
  9636: Tenzen...${prompt}
  9637: ${name-player}, I journey to the La Theine Plateau in search of the wisdom of Carbuncle.${prompt}
  9638: With the power and guidance of the bringer of rainbows, I believe we may have a chance at defeating the boy, Selh'teus.${prompt}
  9639: Ulmia...${prompt}
  9640: ${name-player}, I plan to begin my search in San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9641: If Prishe truly did escape from the glaciers on foot, then that would be the closest city. Perhaps someone spotted her passing through.${prompt}
  9642: |-
    True...
    If you happen to find out anything useful, come back here, and we'll see what we can make of it. That goes for all of you.${prompt}
  9643: We're all on this boat for good. We may be in for some rough waters ahead, but you've got nothing to fear with good old Cid at the helm!${prompt}
  9644: |-
    Understood, Master Cid!
    Now let us be off! We have no time to lose!${prompt}
  9645: She said that she was heading for San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9646: He said something about going to ask the assistance of Carbuncle.${prompt}
  9647: He said that he was heading back to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9648: What? You say you're looking for Louverance?${prompt}
  9649: I'm sorry. I haven't seen him around since he left.${prompt}
  9650: |-
    Uncle Cid!
    A pack of angry Goblins attacked the Steaming Sheep Restaurant! Master Oggbi drove them away, but not before they injured some of the guests!${prompt}

    Goblins in Bastok!?

  9652: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  9653: |-
    Come with us right away!
    Jabbos has been taken back to Movalpolos!${prompt}
  9654: |-
    ...!
    Jabbos...!?${prompt}
  9655: Jabbos? Who's that?${prompt}
  9656: A Galka who has been living with the Moblins in Movalpolos.${prompt}
  9657: For the past century he has watched over the creatures...trying to convince them to live in peace with those in the world above their dark caves.${prompt}
  9658: Forget about that man. He has forgotten his roots--thrown away his identity. He is no longer a Galka.${prompt}
  9659: The Moblins attacked him? Hmph. It's probably his own fault.${prompt}
  9660: It may be, but we cannot look the other way. Without the assistance of Jabbos, we may never catch Selh'teus!${prompt}
  9661: Come, ${name-player}. We must hurry back to the underground city!${prompt}
  9662: One hundred years living with the beastmen... That Galka has to be either extremely brave or extremely crazy to attempt a feat like that.${prompt}
  9663: But wait a minute... All that time together with the Moblins would mean that he would know all their secrets... And that's probably why the little guys came to Bastok to take him back to their city!${prompt}
  9664: |-
    ${name-player}.
    You need to hurry back to Movalpolos and help Louverance find Jabbos!${prompt}
  9665: So let me get this straight, the Keeper of the Apocalypse is actually the reincarnation of the Twilight God!?${prompt}
  9666: And we're going to have to fight him!? This is not turning out like I wanted it to...${prompt}
  9667: Does anyone know where the boy, Selh'teus, could have gone off to?${prompt}
  9668: Can't we ask the Moblins? Maybe they know.${prompt}
  9669: |-
    Selh'teus...is gone...
    He left...Movalpolos...
    Moblins...don't know...anything...${prompt}
  9670: The boy...is gone...${prompt}
  9671: |-
    But my friends...
    They believe...he will return...so they continue...to dig...${prompt}
  9672: They will...show him...the way to...the crystal...${prompt}
  9673: '...${prompt}'
  9674: I see... But considering their previous actions, I think it would be a wise idea to keep a watch on them. Who knows what they might try next.${prompt}
  9675: If they were to find a way to the fifth mothercrystal before we do, the consequences could be immeasurable.${prompt}
  9676: I see... But considering their previous actions, I think it would be a wise idea to keep a watch on them. Who knows what they might try next.${prompt}
  9677: We can't just let them lead the keeper straight to the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  9678: |-
    The Moblins...
    My friends...wouldn't...${prompt}
  9679: Master Cid. We have neither the time nor resources to engage the Moblins. Currently we must face the problem before us--Bahamut and his plan to destroy mankind.${prompt}
  9680: If the Moblins are digging this tunnel for the boy, then chances are that he will return when they are finished. And when he does return, that is our perfect opportunity to catch him!${prompt}
  9681: That's true...but think of the implications. A path to the fifth crystal will be opened...${prompt}
  9682: |-
    Alright.
    First we wait for everyone else to get back. There are still quite a few things Prishe needs to clear up. I, myself, am going to need a little more time to finish my work.${prompt}
  9683: Your work? What are you up to, old man?${prompt}
  9684: |-
    Heh heh heh. Would you like to know?
    I'm making my wings.${prompt}
  9685: According to some inside information I just happened to stumble across, Bahamut is hiding out beyond the sea of clouds...higher than any man's ever flown.${prompt}
  9686: 'If I tried to take my baby, ${choice: 4}[/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ]${choice: 1}[/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ]${choice: 2}[/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ]${choice: 3}[C.I.D./Enterprise/Nautilus/Gilgamemnon/Redwing/Blackjack/Falcon/Highwind/Ragnarok/Hilda Garde/Prima Vista/Red Rose/Fahrenheit], up there in her current state, she''d be torn to pieces in the turbulence.${prompt}'
  9687: No, there's a few more things I've got to teach her before we have our date in the heavens.${prompt}
  9688: Excellent! When do you think she will be ready?${prompt}
  9689: Hold your horses there, Louverance. I'm working as fast as I can. I have some of the best craftsmen in Vana'diel on the project.${prompt}
  9690: And until we're done, we need you back in Movalpolos keeping an eye on those Moblins. Do you think you can handle that?${prompt}
  9691: And until we're done, we need you back in Movalpolos keeping an eye on those Moblins. Do you think you can handle that?${prompt}
  9692: You need not worry, Master Cid. Jabbos has provided me with much information on his subterranean companions.${prompt}
  9693: And a few of my...“friends” will also be lending their hands.${prompt}
  9694: |-
    I know...everything about...Movalpolos...
    I know everything...about Moblins...${prompt}
  9695: Alright then. It looks like I've found the right men for the job.${prompt}
  9696: By the way, have you heard anything regarding Lady Prishe?${prompt}
  9697: While searching for information on Al'Taieu, I learned of a group of Mithra known as sin hunters.${prompt}
  9698: I am not sure of the details, but I believe they originally traveled from their Mithran homeland to catch Cardinal Mildaurion and punish her for her past crimes.${prompt}
  9699: However, now that the three believe that the Cardinal is dead, they search for Prishe to have her atone for the sins of Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9700: That's ridiculous! How do they think that they can get away with something so crazy!?${prompt}
  9701: We can only hope that Ulmia finds Prishe in San d'Oria before the Mithran Trackers do...${prompt}
  9702: And then there's Tenzen. No word from him either...${prompt}
  9703: He said he was heading to the La Theine Plateau to ask the terrestrial avatar Carbuncle for help, but...${prompt}
  9704: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Could you try and find out what happened to Ulmia and Tenzen?${prompt}
  9705: They could be in some real trouble. We're counting on you!${prompt}
  9706: |-
    Sin hunters...
    Maybe they, too, are thinking Prishe is the cause of all this...${prompt}
  9707: Master Cid, what are you implying?${prompt}
  9708: |-
    Hm...
    I'll call Tenzen back from Jeuno and have him head for Movalpolos.${prompt}
  9709: The things he told us were unbelievable. You've got to hear them for yourself.${prompt}
  9710: ${name-player}, we have to find Prishe as soon as possible. That's why I want you to head for San d'Oria and help Ulmia in her search.${prompt}
  9711: Good luck, and may Altana be with you.${prompt}
  9712: |-
    Hmmm...
    Ulmia just came by a few days ago with a few of those trackers. They said they had found Prishe, but that she had got away before they could...finish their business.${prompt}
  9713: They also said that when she escaped, she took a large chunk of magicite known as the Star of Tavnazia with her. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?${prompt}
  9714: |-
    The Star of Tavnazia...
    It was said to have been lost twenty years ago during the Great War...
    You say that Lady Prishe possesses it!?${prompt}
  9715: But where could she have run off to...?${prompt}
  9716: And that's exactly why we're stuck like a chocobo in the mud. Ulmia hasn't slept for days, the poor child.${prompt}
  9717: Well, all we can do know is wait for Tenzen to come back and pray that he has found something.${prompt}
  9718: ${name-player}, Tenzen said he was heading for the La Theine Plateau to find Carbuncle. Why don't you try joining him?${prompt}
  9719: |-
    Master Cid!
    Has Lady Ulmia returned!?
    And what of Lady Prishe!?${prompt}
  9720: Whoa, calm down, now. Why don't you tell us what happened...${prompt}
  9721: |-
    Calm down. Calm down. Ulmia arrived back here a few days ago. She's resting in one of our guest residences. Prishe... Well, there are still no signs of her...
    But before we set out to look for her, why don't you tell us what you found out on your journey.${prompt}
  9722: The terrestrial avatars told you that? It's so hard to believe, but...${prompt}
  9723: Some of the things Nag'molada said do make some sense.${prompt}
  9724: For example, the recent strange energy readings from the crags. I've studied those as well.${prompt}
  9725: But I never imagined that the remnants of the ancients were trying to do something as crazy as that--using the lines to converge the energy from all five crystals...${prompt}
  9726: '...and ultimately use that concentrated power to open the Gates of Paradise...${prompt}'
  9727: |-
    Hmmm...
    I'm not positive, but with that much energy, opening the gates may not be as impossible as it sounds.${prompt}
  9728: And with all the technology those hooded scientists in Jeuno have...${prompt}
  9729: But wait a minute. Didn't they already try opening the gates ten thousand years ago...and fail miserably? Just look at their capital! It sunk to the bottom of the sea.${prompt}
  9730: Until we find out what this Paradise place really is, we can't let the Zilart go on doing as they please.${prompt}
  9731: That is true, but we first must face the problem that lies before us--the Keeper of the Apocalypse!${prompt}
  9732: I was certain that Selh'teus was the one we were searching for, but after hearing the testimony of Fenrir...${prompt}
  9733: That the Keeper of the Apocalypse would be born unto Tavnazia...${prompt}
  9734: |-
    Tenzen.
    According to what you've told me, Prishe's treatment in Tavnazia was quite out of the ordinary.${prompt}
  9735: Are you trying to say that this is because...she is the keeper?${prompt}
  9736: |-
    While it pains me to believe so, all the recent events seem to point to that conclusion.
    I have asked Phoenix numerous times for an answer, but she only replies that she, too, does not know...${prompt}
  9737: But if it is true--if Prishe is the Keeper of the Apocalypse...then there is only one thing I can do...${prompt}
  9738: Hold on, Tenzen! We still don't know for sure that she's the one!${prompt}
  9739: Yeah, she's a little rude, and a little crude, and a heck of a lot wilder than I like most of my company. But once you get past that, you realize that she's one of the most honest people you'll ever meet. I couldn't imagine her lying to a soul, let alone be untrue to herself.${prompt}
  9740: Tenzen, you can't truly believe that she's inherited the will of Promathia, can you?${prompt}
  9741: However, I cannot doubt what I saw. I believe that Fenrir showed me what he did for a reason.${prompt}
  9742: It is the sole wish of the terrestrial avatars to keep the Gates of Paradise closed. Anyone who attempts to open the gates will undoubtedly become their enemy.${prompt}
  9743: Perhaps the will of Promathia remains dormant within Lady Prishe. Perhaps she simply has not realized that she carries the seed of twilight.${prompt}
  9744: '...${prompt}'
  9745: Well, there's one way to find out--and that's finding Prishe.${prompt}
  9746: We can decide what to do then...even if that involves...${prompt}
  9747: ${name-player}, I want you to head for San d'Oria and check up on Ulmia.${prompt}
  9748: It also worries me how we haven't heard anything from Louverance as well...${prompt}
  9749: He said he was going to try to gather information on the celestial capital of Al'Taieu, but...${prompt}
  9750: I will travel to Jeuno and investigate the situation there. If the Duchy were to find Prishe before we do...${prompt}
  9751: Farewell, Master Cid.${prompt}
  9752: |-
    Ahem!
    We do have some good news for you, though, Tenzen.
    It sounds like Louverance was able to find Selh'teus.${prompt}
  9753: On top of that, we also may have found a way to get to the fifth mothercrystal under the North Sea.${prompt}
  9754: You have what!?${prompt}
  9755: If you want the details, you should go talk with Louverance yourself.${prompt}
  9756: Raibaht, would you tell Tenzen where he can find his companions?${prompt}
  9757: |-
    Alright.
    But I'm going to have to ask you to refrain from questioning Ulmia until Louverance gets back. We don't want to jump to any conclusions before we've grasped the whole picture.${prompt}
  9758: Tenzen. I understand that you blame yourself for not being able to find Prishe, but think of poor Ulmia and how she would react.${prompt}
  9759: Very well, Master Cid. I promise I will not speak of what I saw to lady Ulmia until the return of Sir Louverance.${prompt}
  9760: If it is not too much to ask, might I inquire as to where she is staying?${prompt}
  9761: Raibaht, show Tenzen to Ulmia's room.${prompt}
  9762: |-
    ${name-player}...
    To tell you the truth, I think we may be in way over our heads here...${prompt}
  9763: |-
    Up until now, whether it be for science or justice, I've never thought too deeply about what I was getting into--I just took the ball and ran with it as fast as I could. But this time... This time a little voice in the back of my head is telling me that I should be careful.
    I don't know. Maybe I'm just getting old.${prompt}
  9764: It's those “ancients” that you keep talking about. If they're rooted firmly in Jeuno, there may not be anything we can do to pull them out.${prompt}
  9765: Fighting wyrms and beastmen is bad enough. I shudder to think what would happen if the Duchy's army was thrown into the mix...${prompt}
  9766: And there's something else that has been bothering me.${prompt}
  9767: This “Far Eastern” country that Tenzen has supposedly traveled from... Even the pirates of Norg know little about it. How do we know if we can really trust him...?${prompt}
  9768: |-
    Who speaks the truth and who peddles lies? It is becoming harder and harder to tell.
    I see a storm brewing on our horizon. If we don't take care, our ship may sink, and everything we have fought for up to now may be lost.${prompt}
  9769: If you really want to save your nation and its people, you have to be strong. See things with your own eyes; make decisions with your own heart. Don't be fooled by those with ulterior motives.${prompt}
  9770: Oh, sorry about that, ${name-player}. I didn't mean to sound like a father scolding his ${choice-player-gender}[son/daughter].${prompt}
  9771: |-
    Hm?
    What's wrong?${prompt}
  9772: Louverance mentioned he was going to begin his search for Al'Taieu in Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9773: If you hurry, you might be able to catch up with him.${prompt}
  9774: And I know I just told you to make decisions with your own heart, but I think that another good thing for you to do right now is find Prishe...${prompt}
  9775: Ulmia said that she was going to San d'Oria to look for her. Why don't you go and see if she found anything?${prompt}
  9776: If Prishe is the abhorrent one like Tenzen says she is, then our only key to saving her will be Ulmia.${prompt}
  9777: Hurry, ${name-player}. I don't think that we have much more time. We have to get to Prishe before...${prompt}
  9778: |-
    Ulmia!?
    Who is that with you? They're not...${prompt}
  9779: Yes, they are the Mithran sin hunters--the trackers who have come to our land to find Prishe.${prompt}
  9780: |-
    Mithran sin hunters!
    Then Prishe has already been...punished!?${prompt}
  9781: |-
    Of course not, Master Cid!
    However, we were able to find her!${prompt}
  9782: But now she is gone again... And she took the magicite with her!${prompt}
  9783: |-
    Ulmia!?
    Hm? And who might these three be?${prompt}
  9784: They are the Mithran Trackers--sin hunters who have come from the Mithran homeland to find...Prishe.${prompt}
  9785: |-
    Sin hunters!
    What did Prishe ever do to the Mithra!?
    Wait, does this mean you found her?${prompt}
  9786: Yes, we were able to locate her.${prompt}
  9787: However, she went off on her own again...with the magicite...${prompt}
  9788: The magicite! Fill me in on the details, Ulmia.${prompt}
  9789: |-
    I see...
    I didn't realize that Tavnazia's magicite was that powerful...or that dangerous.${prompt}
  9790: So, it was the energy from that stone that affected the members of the Multinational Expedition--it invaded their hearts and minds, ultimately driving them to do the unspeakable.${prompt}
  9791: Exactly. Our country's rrrepresentative on that expedition found a shard of magicite and brought it back to our homeland. It was then that we, too, realized its terrifying power.${prompt}
  9792: However, we were never told where that shard came from. Further Mithran expeditions were sent to the Northlands to investigate the stone's origins, but they were unsuccessful.${prompt}
  9793: No, it was a completely different investigation that led us to the answer. While searching for the rrrelic of the dragon stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih, we found what we were looking for.${prompt}
  9794: |-
    You...
    You met with Prishe and Cardinal Mildaurion in the Tavnazian Cathedral?${prompt}
  9795: After a bit of...persuasion, the cardinal showed us what they called the “Star of Tavnazia.” In other words--magicite.${prompt}
  9796: We told her of the terrible power that the magicite contained, and demanded that she dispose of it somewhere it would never be seen again.${prompt}
  9797: However, the cardinal would not listen to rrreason.${prompt}
  9798: She would only say that the stone was necessary to wake the gods from their eternal slumber.${prompt}
  9799: Wake the gods...? But that's...!${prompt}
  9800: I could not bring myself to believe Miss Shikaree's words, either. Not until I heard the same story from the San d'Orian Cathedral...${prompt}
  9801: The hymns the Tavnazian choir would sing... Their words possessed the power to bring the gods back to life.${prompt}
  9802: |-
    A stone...
    A song...${prompt}
  9803: Wait! That song Prishe sang to help Selh'teus escape. Is that the same song?${prompt}
  9804: And so, the whole song has been recited...?${prompt}
  9805: |-
    No.
    There is a fifth verse...and only the sleeping gods know it.${prompt}
  9806: However, if one were to inquire with the god that recently awoke in the Uleguerand Range, it is only a matter of time before the fifth and final verse is sung.${prompt}
  9807: |-
    Or possibly the woman in Sel--
    No, I cannot trust you yet with that information.
    Good day.${prompt}
  9808: Master Cid, I wish to continue my search for Prishe with the three Mithran Trackers.${prompt}
  9809: Whoa, hold on there, Ulmia. The trackers are only looking for Prishe so they can...you know...“punish” her.${prompt}
  9810: To ensure her safety, we have to find Prishe before those frisky felines do.${prompt}
  9811: (This is just between you and me, but I've already talked things over with some of my...“acquaintances” in the Tenshodo and Norg. They're scouring the continent for any information on our blue-haired princess. If they find anything, we'll be the first to know. That's why you need to stick around--so you can be here when that info comes in.)${prompt}
  9812: Thank you, Master Cid...for everything...${prompt}
  9813: And to top that off, we've got a first-class adventurer on our side. Isn't that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9814: ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] going to go find out if Louverance has discovered anything of interest.${prompt}
  9815: I'm still not too sure why Prishe would just run off with that fragment of the “Star of Tavnazia,” but I'll bet my apron that it has something to do with that Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9816: ${name-player}. Louverance said he was looking for the cardinal. Maybe he knows something that could be of use. If you hurry, you might be able to catch up with him.${prompt}
  9817: I'm still not too sure why Prishe would just run off with that fragment of the “Star of Tavnazia,” but I'll bet my apron that it has something to do with that boy, Selh'teus.${prompt}
  9818: If Tenzen returns and we can catch this so-called Keeper of the Apocalypse in Movalpolos, the clouds covering this mystery we're knee-deep in just might clear up.${prompt}
  9819: ${name-player}, Tenzen said he was heading to the La Theine Plateau to find Carbuncle. If you hurry, you might be able to meet up with him.${prompt}
  9820: Raibaht, take Ulmia to Cornelia's quarters and have the president's daughter prepare a room for our guest.${prompt}
  9821: Yes, sir...${prompt}
  9822: ${name-player}, with all she's gone through, I don't think it would be wise to inform Ulmia of what Tenzen discovered just yet.${prompt}
  9823: We can't jump to any conclusions about Prishe being the Keeper of the Apocalypse without hearing what our San d'Orian friend has to say.${prompt}
  9824: |-
    Uncle Cid!
    The Tenshodo just sent a message!
    Prishe has been spotted--in Jeuno!${prompt}
  9825: What!?${prompt}
  9826: Prishe? In Jeuno!?${prompt}
  9827: They told her that there was a warrant out for her capture, but she didn't seem to listen.${prompt}
  9828: What's wrong? Why would she go and risk being captured!?${prompt}
  9829: |-
    Jeuno...
    Perhaps... Perhaps she has gone to meet with...${prompt}
  9830: Ulmia? Is there something we should know?${prompt}
  9831: Master Cid! I must leave for Jeuno immediately!${prompt}
  9832: Ulmia!${prompt}
  9833: |-
    This doesn't look good...
    Raibaht! Find Tenzen${choice: 1}[/ and Louverance] and tell ${choice: 1}[him/them] what has happened. Then hurry to Jeuno.${prompt}
  9834: 'Tell ${choice: 1}[him/them] not to worry about Movalpolos. I''ll have a party of musketeers...no, gold musketeers sent there right away.${prompt}'
  9835: ${name-player}. You had better go to Jeuno as well.${prompt}
  9836: If you can't find Prishe, then we'll all meet in front of the Grand Duke Palace and plan our next move.${prompt}
  9837: If she's already been captured, then I can guarantee you she'll be somewhere in that building.${prompt}
  9838: ${name-player}! Where have you been!?${prompt}
  9839: I heard about what happened, but I still can't believe it...${prompt}
  9840: Learning Prishe was really the Keeper of the Apocalypse knocked me off my chair...${prompt}
  9841: But finding out that the Jeunoan official Esha'ntarl is actually Cardinal Mildaurion, and that she's been alive for the past ten thousand years...that was like having an anvil dropped on my head.${prompt}
  9842: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I want to hear what happened with you, too. Call in all the others.${prompt}
  9843: Hmmm. So that's what happened...${prompt}
  9844: To fulfill the pact that Bahamut and Selh'teus made over ten thousand years ago, Mildaurion has been attempting to revive Divine Promathia...${prompt}
  9845: And the magicite embedded in Prishe's bosom was only a sealed, crystallized form of her inner Emptiness.${prompt}
  9846: We sin hunters have committed a grave sin ourselves in not being able to stay calm and focused in the presence of the magicite.${prompt}
  9847: |-
    Not a single complaint... Not a single cry for help...
    All that time carrying a terrible burden...alone...${prompt}
  9848: And what about Ulmia? She has known Prishe since she was a child. She has watched her silently struggle.${prompt}
  9849: These new truths must be as painful for her as they are for Prishe.${prompt}
  9850: I could not wish such a terrible fate upon even an enemy.${prompt}
  9851: What are we to do now?${prompt}
  9852: Phoenix has told me that we are not to provoke Bahamut any further.${prompt}
  9853: However, the biggest threat to mankind is the Wyrmking's aerial magick.${prompt}
  9854: If we could defeat him, it would better our chances for victory against the wyrm armies.${prompt}
  9855: And so we are left with three choices.${prompt}
  9856: We can let destiny run its course and wait for Bahamut and his minions to destroy us...${prompt}
  9857: We can use my airship to join the Jeuno armada and fight the Wyrmking...${prompt}
  9858: Or we can recite the fifth verse of the “Memoria de la S^tona” and call the Twilight God down onto Prishe...${prompt}
  9859: |-
    Twilight God...
    He cursed...mankind... Made us...fight...${prompt}
  9860: If we...defeat him...the curse...will be broken...${prompt}
  9861: But...do we have...the power...?${prompt}
  9862: Prishe said that ${name-player} had that power.${prompt}
  9863: And we have Phoenix on our side!${prompt}
  9864: But I am not sure that is enough...${prompt}
  9865: Diabolos, ruler of dreams, warned us that no single child of Vana'diel could vanquish the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  9866: And still my blade remains silent...${prompt}
  9867: We are about to walk down a very dangerous path...${prompt}
  9868: But I think it would be wise to wait until Prishe returns before we take any action.${prompt}
  9869: Tenzen, Ms. Sin Hunters, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  9870: Hurry to Tavnazia and wait for Prishe. When she arrives, contact me and I will fly to the archipelago in my airship.${prompt}
  9871: Tavnazia? But why would you travel there?${prompt}
  9872: Help from Gilgamesh should be arriving at the safehold shortly.${prompt}
  9873: Let's just say the parts they'll be transporting are very...“sensitive.”${prompt}
  9874: I'll see you all at the Sealion's Den!${prompt}
  9875: Welcome back, everybody!${prompt}
  9876: I'm glad to see that you're all safe. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to meet you in Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9877: Cid! Can the small talk and get your hunk-o-junk airship's motor runnin'!${prompt}
  9878: Hold on, little lady. You just got back. Don't tell me that you're ready to go back to the clouds.${prompt}
  9879: I thought we were leaving Bahamut to the armada.${prompt}
  9880: |-
    We are!
    Our destination is the Keeper of the Apocalypse and Nag'molada!${prompt}
  9881: Nag'molada...invaded Movalpolos...blocked entrance...to fifth crystal... Hurt friends...${prompt}
  9882: But there is still a way. Phoenix will lead us!${prompt}
  9883: The fifth mothercrystal? Isn't that supposed to be somewhere under Shu'Meyo?${prompt}
  9884: Now that you mention it, I just received a report that a strange red light began shooting up from the north sea.${prompt}
  9885: |-
    A light?
    That's it! Let's go! Come on! Come on!${prompt}
  9886: Hold your horses, Prishe. My bird's still beat up pretty bad, and it will take a little longer to fix her up.${prompt}
  9887: |-
    Huh!?
    But we're so damn close!${prompt}
  9888: By the time the rrrepairs have been made, the armada will have already set off for Bahamut...${prompt}
  9889: |-
    And Cid's is the only ship fast enough and strong enough to make the journey.
    It seems as if our luck has finally trickled away.${prompt}
  9890: No. I cannot believe that Altana has turned her back on us.${prompt}
  9891: I believe the goddess has granted us this time to prepare our hearts and our souls for what may be the final battle.${prompt}
  9892: |-
    Time...
    I will use...this time to...heal my friends...${prompt}
  9893: And I will use this time to help Cid with the airship's repairs!${prompt}
  9894: Hah hah hah! Another hand is always welcome. This is starting to look like it's going to be the biggest repair job in the history of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  9895: And I'm not just talking about the airship! It's time we get out there and save the world!${prompt}
  9896: You took the words right out of my mouth, old man! Vana'diel's not finished yet! At least not if I have anything to say about it!${prompt}
  9897: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Are you ready to go kick some apocalyptic butt!?${prompt}
  9898: |-
    Well?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's give 'em hell!
    Do we have to go now?${prompt}
  9899: Heh heh! You took the words right out of my mouth!${prompt}
  9900: |-
    Huh!?
    You're not slitherin' your way out of this one, ${name-player}! We need you!${prompt}
  9901: Alright, everybody, you heard Ulmia! Go out and do what you have to do. When my baby's ready I'll give you a call!${prompt}
  9902: My bird's repairs are going smoother than I could have ever imagined. With all the confusion in Jeuno, nobody has the time to complain about an unauthorized test run every now and then! Hah hah hah!${prompt}
  9903: Yeah, but to tell you the truth, I'm sure glad I got to meet up with Prishe again. She's one hell of a girl. I wouldn't be surprised if she saved Vana'diel with her own two hands!${prompt}
  9904: Well, that finishes up our maintenance on the cannons.${prompt}
  9905: The old girls have been kept in pretty good shape. They should hold up if the need for them arises.${prompt}
  9906: I just hope nothing that bad ever happens.${prompt}
  9907: I would have to agree.${prompt}
  9908: |-
    But we must stay on our guard.
    That beastman lair appeared overnight, right on our doorstep...${prompt}
  9909: |-
    Greetings, adventurer.
    Have you come looking for employment?${prompt}
  9910: |-
    Looking for work?
    ${selection-lines}
    Now that you mention it...
    Not today...${prompt}
  9911: I have a task perfectly suited for an adventurer.${prompt}
  9912: Have you heard about the Goblin lair that suddenly appeared in North Gustaberg?${prompt}
  9913: According to scholars, the Goblins living in this lair are a separate tribe known as the Moblins.${prompt}
  9914: Goblins ordinarily avoid gathering together and building settlements, but apparently these Moblins have a vastly different social structure.${prompt}
  9915: With several of their number living in Jeuno, it can be said that we are on much friendlier terms with Goblins than the other beastmen races.${prompt}
  9916: However, there is still much we don't know about the Moblins.${prompt}
  9917: In order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, we need to determine whether or not they harbor hostile intentions towards us.${prompt}
  9918: |-
    Preparations for military action are underway.
    But first we wish to ask adventurers like you to conduct a thorough investigation.${prompt}
  9919: Will you undertake this task?${prompt}
  9920: |-
    Will you do it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9921: |-
    Excellent.
    Please report to the scholar at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant for further details.${prompt}
  9922: |-
    I'm sorry to hear that.
    Please be sure to talk to me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9923: |-
    A beastman lair has appeared in North Gustaberg.
    The Goblins living in this lair are a separate tribe known as the Moblins.${prompt}
  9924: Please report to the scholar at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant for further details on your task.${prompt}
  9925: |-
    ...Crystal propulsion unit...
    ......Hooded scientists.........${prompt}
  9926: |-
    ...
    You have to promise me you won't tell anyone else what I'm about to tell you.${prompt}
  9927: |-
    ...
    Remember, you are not to tell anyone that the chief is building a new airship.${prompt}
  9928: Currently, the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in conjunction with the air travel agency, has formed a monopoly on all forms of airship travel.${prompt}
  9929: To compete against Jeuno's empire in the skies, we must reinforce our research in aeronautics development. However, if the Duchy were to learn of our actions, they would not be pleased.${prompt}
  9930: That is why our chief has gone to great lengths to keep his acquisition of an out-of-service airship a secret to all but those who need to know.${prompt}
  9931: And that is why we must not draw any attention to ourselves by collecting large quantities of materials at one time.${prompt}
  9932: 'However, our supply of ${item-plural: 1[2]} has almost run dry. If we don''t have enough of that item, we cannot continue our modifications of the airship.${prompt}'
  9933: 'To help the chief with his airship modification project, we need a large quantity of ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  9934: However, we do not want to draw any unwanted attention to ourselves by importing through Jeuno...${prompt}
  9935: |-
    This is exactly what the chief needs for his project.
    The Republic thanks you for your assistance.${prompt}
  9936: It is not much, but here is a bit of reimbursement.${prompt}
  9937: |-
    ...
    We have a slight problem...
    The chief asked an adventurer to bring him a highly advanced altimeter from Jeuno.${prompt}
  9938: However, while the adventurer was traveling through the Duchy, he was stopped and arrested for attempting to transport the restricted item.${prompt}
  9939: 'While the adventurer was able to hide the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} before he was taken into custody, he has been ordered to defeat an unknown beast in Delkfutt''s Tower before he can return home.${prompt}'
  9940: 'We do not have the time to wait for him, and that is why we need your assistance again. Would you travel to Delkfutt''s Tower, ask the adventurer where he hid the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, then find it and bring it back here?${prompt}'
  9941: 'You may use this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}. If you put the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} in it, the Ducal Guard and the customs officials at the air travel agency should not find the item.${prompt}'
  9942: |-
    Accept the job?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9943: The adventurer we seek has been ordered to defeat a monster known as Orna. Find the monster...and you will find him.${prompt}
  9944: The adventurer we seek has been ordered to travel to Delkfutt's Tower and defeat a monster known as Orna.${prompt}
  9945: 'Find that man and have him tell you where he hid the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9946: With this, the chief will be able to improve on his current theories and further develop new aerodynamic technologies.${prompt}
  9947: Again, it is not much, but please accept this reward for your services.${prompt}
  9948: The chief's theories are flawless. However, there remains one mountain he still must conquer.${prompt}
  9949: I don't know the details, but the chief has been up day and night trying to solve this final problem.${prompt}
  9950: Normally at times like these, I would not bother him...${prompt}
  9951: But I fear that this may be too difficult for the chief to handle on his own. Even Lady Cornelia has begun to worry about her father's long-time friend.${prompt}
  9952: After watching the chief for the past few weeks, I think I came to realize what was troubling him.${prompt}
  9953: Until recently, Chief Cid had been working on what he called a “semiperpetual motion engine.” However, after months of making little or no progress, he finally gave up on the idea.${prompt}
  9954: 'If he were only able to acquire the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that had been used in previous semiperpetual motion experiments...${prompt}'
  9955: It is said that the ancients were able to process the material and harness its hidden power, but since then, no one has succeeded in reproducing those results.${prompt}
  9956: |-
    This...
    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} of legend!
    But it cannot be...${prompt}
  9957: Let us show it to the chief and see what he has to say.${prompt}
  9958: 'Chief Cid. ${name-player} has found what ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] claims is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9959: |-
    What!?
    But I thought that stone no longer remained on Vana'diel!${prompt}
  9960: |-
    Amazing...
    Just as the legends say.
    This heat that the ${item-singular: 1[2]} produces... Where does it come from?${prompt}
  9961: You have done well, ${name-player}. Now the chief can continue his experiments.${prompt}
  9962: 'Chief Cid. With the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, your dream of building a semiperpetual motion engine will finally be realized.${prompt}'
  9963: |-
    Hm? The what?
    Oh, that project? I gave up on that weeks ago.
    But this stone... Just think of all the possibilities!${prompt}
  9964: |-
    Ahem!
    But there are much more important things to be worried about right now.
    There's this one thing that's been troubling me for the past month.${prompt}
  9965: And what would that be, chief?${prompt}
  9966: |-
    What else?
    The name for my new bird!${prompt}
  9967: I thought about simply calling her the “C.I.D.” but where's the fun in that?${prompt}
  9968: Right now I'm simply calling her the “Cid,” but where's the fun in that?${prompt}
  9969: |-
    That's it!
    ${name-player}, you've been helping me prepare my big girl.
    Why don't you make the final call?${prompt}
  9970: I've come up with a few ideas of my own. Choose from these.${prompt}

    Yes. My name is Sanctia.
    I am searching for the bounty hunter Goldmane to ask him something very important.${prompt}

  10037: |-
    Ahahaha.
    What an amusing idea.${prompt}
  10038: The Bastokan navy is not for rent, my dear.${prompt}
  10039: And I don't know anyone who could stand to live on one of our battleships for twenty years!${prompt}
  10040: "But... \nBut the letter had your name...${prompt}"
  10041: |-
    I see.
    That old letter is the cause of all this.${prompt}
  10042: |-
    Let me explain.
    I wrote that letter to Goldmane concerning another bounty hunter.${prompt}
  10043: You mean Goldmane's partner, Ismenios Cutsilver?${prompt}
  10044: |-
    Correct.
    Ismenios was the son of Praefactus Leonnel of the Bastokan navy, and a former student of mine.${prompt}
  10045: Ismenios graduated from the Naval Recruit Training Barracks with the highest honors and the potential to become a talented commander.${prompt}
  10046: Then one day, apparently unfulfilled by naval life, he declared he would leave Praefactus Leonnel's command to become a bounty hunter.${prompt}
  10047: Praefactus Leonnel made no effort to track down his son.${prompt}
  10048: |-
    But I had swung a sword alongside Leonnel in the Great War, and had gotten to know him well.
    I could tell he was hurting inside.${prompt}
  10049: Along with Goldmane's cooperation, I convinced Ismenios that he should return to Bastok.${prompt}
  10050: No matter the situation, parents always worry for their children, kupopo.${prompt}
  10051: '...${prompt}'
  10052: But do you know the whole story, young lady?${prompt}
  10053: Before his journey home, Ismenios Cutsilver lost his life during the capture of Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  10054: The Musketeer investigation of the incident showed that Goldmane was responsible for Ismenios's death.${prompt}
  10055: |-
    Praefactus Leonnel would never stoop to anything so juvenile as revenge.
    But he has never forgiven Goldmane.${prompt}
  10056: So you see, there is no way the man you seek would be under the protection of the Bastokan navy.${prompt}
  10057: Then where on Vana'diel could Goldmane be hiding...?${prompt}
  10058: Well, now that you mention it...${prompt}
  10059: There have been rumors of the remaining thugs of Atarefaunet's Band sniffing around for your elusive bounty hunter.${prompt}
  10060: Whispers in dark corners have them on the trail of the owner of Purgonorgo Isle, one of the islands found in Bibiki Bay.${prompt}

    Here, I want you to have this. We've learned a few things studying the makeup of these contraptions.${prompt}
  10069: While you cannot tell by just looking at them, these tiny stones carry an enormous amount of data--the kind of data that can be found in powerful biotechnological weapons. Unfortunately, that's not a field I am well-versed in.${prompt}
  10070: However, when I was in Jeuno working on the development of the Duchy's airships, I did have the opportunity to witness chip technology at work.${prompt}
  10071: And from what I saw, it's safe to say that the men and women involved in that project were not thinking about peace and prosperity for all mankind.${prompt}
  10072: That's why I've been using these chips to try to develop a way to neutralize the weapons...if it ever should come to that.${prompt}
  10073: This pump is just a prototype, but it might be of some use if you find yourself in a tight situation.${prompt}
  10074: I plan on continuing my research, so if you happen to find any more chips, bring them to my lab and I will keep you informed of my latest findings.${prompt}
  10075: Ah, another set of chips. Thank you, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    I've got Louverance and the Mithra girls out finding me supplies, but...${prompt}
  10080: It's the crystal propulsion unit. The heart of my beautiful bird has been broken.${prompt}
  10081: Tenzen seemed to think that we could find a solution to our problem in Jeuno, but I haven't seen hide nor hair of him since he left.${prompt}
  10082: Hmmm. If I had a less complicated device that showed how the ancients sublimated the power of the crystals, then maybe I could fix the propulsion unit myself...${prompt}
  10083: Well, there's no point in gathering any more supplies at this stage. Would you go and tell Louverance and the ladies to come back to Bastok?${prompt}
  10084: Louverance should be near Carpenters' Landing looking for lumber, and Shikaree Z was off to Bibiki Bay to find some special ores.${prompt}

  10550: S-snares? I don't know what you're talking about!${prompt}
  10551: Anyway, please get rid of them. A man could get seriously injured just walking around!${prompt}

  10563: What?${prompt}
  10564: Yeah, well, um...I'm wearing down at this rate, you see...${prompt}
  10565: I can just pretend we've never done business together, if you like. I have a lot of others I can work with instead.${prompt}
  10566: B-but...all I want is to slow down the pace a little...${prompt}
  10567: I don't know about your worries, but I've got enough on my own plate as is. If you can't comply with my needs...${prompt}

  10602: 'Hey, you were selling ${color: 5}lucky charms${color: 1}, right? Do you have anything I could use to protect me?${prompt}'
  10603: Why yes, of course! You can have the charm for luck in general! That should protect you against anything!${prompt}
  10604: I'll take one, then!${prompt}
  10605: Oh yes, I forgot to mention it, but the general luck charm will only take effect when in possession of the other three charms.${prompt}
  10606: What? Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?${prompt}
  10607: O-of course not! The general luck charm is splenderiffic stuff, created by the casting of countless incantations!${prompt}
  10608: I see. Well, I don't want to be troubled by that stalker again, that's for sure! I'll take them all.${prompt}

  10743: She's seen some hard times and never quite recovered.${prompt}
  10744: You see, Aileen had this childhood friend during the time of the Great War...${prompt}
  10745: But one day, her friend apparently left town without a word to Aileen.${prompt}
  10746: |-
    Aileen spent days waiting under a tree by the river in the Bastok Markets for her friend to appear.
    She wouldn't accept the fact that her companion had simply abandoned her.${prompt}
  10747: As you can guess, Aileen never saw the girl again.${prompt}
  10748: She acts as if the disappearance of her friend doesn't bother her, but it's obvious she was deeply hurt.${prompt}
  10749: Of course, that doesn't excuse her terrible manners towards a customer.${prompt}
  10750: |-
    Up until now I've just closed my eyes to her behavior.
    Perhaps that wasn't the wisest course...${prompt}
  10751: I never knew Miss Aileen had such a sad story behind that temper...${prompt}
  10752: |-
    Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. I'm glad to see you weren't scared away.
    Hm? You want me to give this to Miss Aileen?${prompt}
  10753: |-
    What are you doing, chatting with customers?
    We still have that huge order from the blacksmith's guild to cook up.${prompt}
  10754: |-
    I wasn't chatting, Miss Aileen.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] wanted you to have this...${prompt}
  10755: |-
    Hey, aren't you the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who likes to interfere with my business?
    Is this some sort of peace offering?${prompt}
  10756: What? You say this is from Karla?${prompt}
  10757: How...how did you know about her?${prompt}
  10758: So, she was on her way to Lahnefeld...${prompt}
  10759: '...${prompt}'
  10760: How could I have ever doubted poor Karla...?${prompt}
  10761: |-
    I just took it for granted that she would always be there to play with me.
    I never thanked her...${prompt}
  10762: I'm sure the time you spent with Karla was just as important to her as it was to you.${prompt}
  10763: Why else would she bring you such a pretty gift?${prompt}
  10764: |-
    I-I'm sorry...
    Please mind the counter.${prompt}
  10765: |-
    She'll be off to sit under that tree in the markets, I'd imagine.
    It must be heartbreaking to hear the truth after all these years.${prompt}
  10766: |-
    Oh, I've gone and cried into my rolanberry pies--they'll taste sour now.
    Miss Aileen will be so angry...${prompt}
  10767: |-
    Hello, I'm the new apprentice cook, Leonhardt.
    I look forward to meeting all your dining needs.${prompt}
  10768: |-
    It looks like that apprentice has finally been accepted by the other chefs.
    Now I can eat my meals in peace!${prompt}
  10769: There's not much call for it with the current peace, but they sang songs about my feats of cannonry out in Batallia Downs back in the day.${prompt}
  10770: I wish I had a chance to show you I can do more than just stand around in a big, round room...${prompt}
  10771: Did I ever meet a ghost in the mountains of Grauberg?${prompt}
  10772: What do you know about that?${prompt}
  10773: Well, now that you mention it, I did once meet someone who apparently learned of my father's last words from a ghost.${prompt}
  10774: But it was all just an act by the soldiers in the outpost. And I fell for it--hook, line, and sinker.${prompt}
  10775: I discovered the truth the next time I was deployed to Grauberg and stumbled across a script one of the soldiers must have dropped.${prompt}
  10776: |-
    Was I furious?
    Well, ordinarily I would be, except...${prompt}
  10777: I understood that it was their way of helping out people like me--to help me overcome my loss.${prompt}
  10778: |-
    Oh, and this play even had a title--Message on the Wind.
    I thought I would laugh up my bootlaces.${prompt}
  10779: |-
    The play even had a title--Message on the Wind.
    I thought I would laugh up my bootlaces.${prompt}
  10780: You have business with me?${prompt}
  10781: Did I learn swordfighting from Elder Werei when I was younger?${prompt}
  10782: |-
    That's right.
    Everything he taught me has become like second nature to me now.${prompt}
  10783: He often said, “The river has many branches, but they all flow into the sea.”${prompt}
  10784: You want me to tell you about the time during the Great War when Elder Werei instructed me in swordfighting?${prompt}
  10785: I once imparted to you the teachings of my master--“Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread.”${prompt}
  10786: He also taught me, “The river has many branches, but they all flow into the sea.”${prompt}
  10787: |-
    I was too young to understand the meaning behind those words at the time.
    But now that I've been through my fair share of trials, I understand them all too well...${prompt}
  10788: |-
    Hm?
    Did my master have any particular place he preferred to be?${prompt}
  10789: Now that you mention it, he and Gumbah often used to travel to Grauberg.${prompt}
  10790: What was it about that mountain...?${prompt}
  10791: |-
    Yes? You need something?
    I've no time for idle chitchat.${prompt}
  10792: |-
    Son of a hexagun! Are those ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}?
    What in the Goddess's name are you doing with those?${prompt}
  10793: |-
    I see, I see.
    Bullets to blast through magic armor, you say?${prompt}
  10794: 'You wouldn''t happen to be lookin'' for something like the old ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} they used back in the Great War, would you?${prompt}'
  10795: |-
    Ahh...stirs up memories in this old Galka's soul, it does.
    After the war ended, I never thought I'd hear the name again.${prompt}
  10796: |-
    Goddess only knows what you'd want with those old things...but yes, I think I could do it for you.
    There's just one catch. The casting process requires some rather...rare...ingredients.${prompt}
  10797: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, to be exact.${prompt}'
  10798: Provide me with what I need, and the job is as good as done.${prompt}
  10799: |-
    Where to find them, you ask? I haven't a clue.
    They say there was once a plentiful supply in North Gustaberg, but it was exhausted completely by the war's end...${prompt}
  10800: Provide me with the materials I need, and your job is as good as done.${prompt}
  10801: |-
    Where to find them...? I haven't a clue.
    I hear they used to be plentiful in North Gustaberg, but the supply was surely exhausted years ago...${prompt}
  10802: |-
    Oh ho, well look at this! It seems I underestimated you.
    Well, a promise is a promise...one order of beastman-blasting bullets, coming right up!${prompt}
  10803: |-
    Good craftsmanship takes time, but I'll be done before you know it.
    Why don't you head to the Markets and try to catch yourself a gold carp or two while you wait?${prompt}
  10804: |-
    Don't you know better than to rush a master at work?
    Just a bit longer, I say!${prompt}
  10805: |-
    I was wondering when you'd come back.
    Here you are, one order of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, just like we used to make 'em!${prompt}
  10806: |-
    I even took the liberty of making a few improvements to the old recipe.
    One blast from these and even the most potent magical armor will be reduced to little more than scrap metal.${prompt}
  10807: |-
    My fee? Hah! Don't mention it!
    I haven't enjoyed my work this much in years.
    If you come across any other curiosities, you know where to find me!${prompt}
  10808: Press button to proceed.${prompt}
  10809: |-
    Greetings, friend. I am Registrar Cloud Walker.
    My duty is to issue marriage certificates to married couples.${prompt}
  10810: What can I do for you today?${prompt}
  10811: |-
    The marriage certificate is a legal document issued in recognition of the matrimony of two individuals.
    It can also be used as a wall decoration for your Mog House.${prompt}
  10812: Couples wishing to receive the certificate must show proof of their marriage, and this can be done in a number of ways.${prompt}
  10813: |-
    The couple should form a party while the husband is wearing his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}.
    After that, speak to me, and I'll draw up the certificates for you.${prompt}
  10814: 'But if you possess a ${color: 5}wedding ring${color: 1}, the procedure can be completed on your own.${prompt}'
  10815: |-
    Keep in mind though, that you can't have more than one certificate at any given time.
    Also, the nation of issuance for your certificate must be the same as your partner's.${prompt}
  10816: One last thing. A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.${prompt}
  10817: A wedding is a joyful occasion in which two souls brought together by fate are joined as partners in life.${prompt}
  10818: In Bastok, it's customary for the bride and groom to swear an oath of endless love in the presence of witnesses. After which, wedding rings are exchanged.${prompt}
  10819: 'To conclude the proceedings, all those present join in a toast with ${color: 5}bottles of grape juice${color: 1} in hand and share in the newly joined couple''s happiness.${prompt}'
  10820: 'First of all, you''ll need to prepare wedding rings--a ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1} and a ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}, to be precise.${prompt}'
  10821: As their synthesis requires rare, hard-to-find ingredients, there truly is no better token of undying devotion between two people.${prompt}
  10822: |-
    Before you present the ring to your partner, you should consider engraving your name onto it using a ${color: 5}cyclone crystal${color: 1}.
    This practice is widespread among adventurers nowadays.${prompt}
  10823: 'You''ll also find that ${color: 5}benedight coats${color: 1} and ${color: 5}wedding dresses${color: 1} are popular as ceremonial attire for men and women, respectively.${prompt}'
  10824: Similar garments exist that can be synthesized. Whether you perform the synthesis yourself or employ a friend to do so, though, is entirely your decision. Gathering the needed ingredients can be pricey, but it's for this reason they're highly valued.${prompt}
  10825: |-
    There's no need to feel dejected, though, if they don't fall within your budget.
    There's no law dictating what couples have to wear at their own wedding, after all.${prompt}
  10826: If you have trouble obtaining any of the ceremonial items I've mentioned, they can also be purchased from the chests you see here.${prompt}
  10827: 'Fireworks, ${color: 5}wedding bells${color: 1}, and the like are also available to help add flavor to your special day, so feel free to purchase whatever you need.${prompt}'
  10828: |-
    It looks like you already have a marriage certificate in your possession.
    I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you another.${prompt}
  10829: 'Your current job level must be level ${number: 2} or higher if you wish to receive a marriage certificate.${prompt}'
  10830: I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you a marriage certificate.${prompt}
  10831: 'Married couples wishing to receive marriage certificates should form a party while the husband is wearing his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}. After that, speak to an official in charge, and the certificates will be drawn up for you.${prompt}'
  10832: |-
    It looks like you've already been issued a marriage certificate by another nation.
    A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.${prompt}
  10833: It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.${prompt}
  10834: |-
    It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.
    If you want one of your own, you'll have to speak with the same officiating body that issued your spouse's.${prompt}
  10835: |-
    Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.
    Also, the nation of issuance for your marriage certificate must be the same as your partner's.${prompt}
  10836: Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.${prompt}
  10837: By the power vested in me by the Republic of Bastok, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.${prompt}
  10838: You are all now officially permitted to eat, drink, sing, and have a joyous night!${prompt}
  10839: |-
    What would you like to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    Request a marriage certificate.
    Learn about marriage certificates.
    Learn about wedding ceremonies.
    Learn about ceremonial items.${prompt}
  10840: |-
    Have a marriage certificate issued?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10841: It appears your better half has made a change. Please restart the process.${prompt}
  10842: An assortment of celebratory goods is available for purchase.${prompt}
  10843: An assortment of wedding attire and wedding rings are available for purchase.${prompt}
  10844: |-
    What will you buy?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${choice: 0}[Wedding dress/Benedight] set: ${number: 1} gil.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 2[2]}: ${number: 3} gil.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10845: |-
    This set includes a ${color: 5}benedight coat${color: 1} and a ${color: 5}pair of benedight hose${color: 1}.
    Price: ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}
  10846: |-
    This set includes a ${color: 5}bridal corsage${color: 1}, a ${color: 5}wedding dress${color: 1}, a ${color: 5}pair of wedding hose${color: 1}, and a ${color: 5}pair of wedding boots${color: 1}.

    Confirm purchase? (Current gil: ${number: 4})
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Cancel.${prompt}
  10848: 'endcode:${number: 0}'
  10849: Hm? Business with the president, ye say?${prompt}
  10850: Iron Eater! What's the disturbance here?${prompt}
  10851: Sir Lucius. This adventurer here's brought a curious document.${prompt}
  10852: Let me see that.${prompt}
  10853: |-
    The two-headed serpent...?
    This is the seal of the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  10854: Come with me at once.${prompt}
  10855: '...That will do.${prompt}'
  10856: How do you read this matter, Lucius?${prompt}
  10857: |-
    This young Empress is either a fool, or she takes us for one.
    I say she's plotting something.${prompt}
  10858: |-
    One thing is clear.
    This colossus has the power to bring down an airship as easily as a musketeer would fell a pigeon.${prompt}
  10859: We may have escaped without casualties once, but there is no guarantee we would be so fortunate a second time.${prompt}
  10860: |-
    Bastok declines the Empire's request.
    Take your document and be off with you.${prompt}
  10861: Mister President!${prompt}
  10862: |-
    You sent me to the Empire to observe Nashmeira's coronation.
    Now hear me when I say that I saw no deception in her eyes.${prompt}
  10863: |-
    I saw one pure of heart.
    One who, despite her tender years, is possessed of the strength and conviction to unite a nation.${prompt}
  10864: '...${prompt}'
  10865: |-
    A leader beloved and trusted by her people.
    A leader who now earnestly seeks our aid.${prompt}
  10866: If we refuse, would we not risk alienating one who might prove to be a steadfast ally?${prompt}
  10867: '...${prompt}'
  10868: Your words ring true, Volker.${prompt}
  10869: |-
    And yet I cannot agree.
    As President, I will not take a course of action that would place my citizens in harm's way.${prompt}
  10870: '...Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  10871: Lucius?${prompt}
  10872: I can scarce believe what I am saying, but...if Captain Volker is so convinced of the Empire's good faith, perhaps we should reconsider.${prompt}
  10873: |-
    Two of my most trusted advisors now tell me to blindly accept this Empress's words.
    What say you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  10874: |-
    Can Nashmeira be trusted?
    ${selection-lines}
    I swear on my life.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  10875: Hmph...and what would a run-of-the-mill adventurer like you know?${prompt}
  10876: Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...${prompt}
  10877: Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...${prompt}
  10878: What are you thinking, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  10879: '...Very well. You have my permission.${prompt}'
  10880: Volker. The moment anything--anything, I say--goes awry, you will take responsibility.${prompt}
  10881: Mister President, sir!${prompt}
  10882: My friends. I am pleased to see your safe return.${prompt}
  10883: Never would I have suspected that Captain Klara was possessed by one of those foul creatures...${prompt}
  10884: And yet, reflecting back on the past months, it explains much.${prompt}
  10885: |-
    In my ignorance, I thought it merely the travails of war that weighed on her mind.
    To think that she was waging an even fiercer battle all this time. A battle for her very soul...${prompt}
  10886: |-
    The knowledge that she may lose herself completely, that at any moment she might turn her blade against her beloved comrades...
    It must have been harrowing, indeed.${prompt}
  10887: |-
    This I know: Klara is fortunate indeed to have friends such as you.
    Were it not for your efforts, there is little doubt we would have lost her long ago.${prompt}
  10888: On behalf of the entire republic, you have my gratitude.${prompt}
  10889: And yet, our battle is far from over.${prompt}
  10890: |-
    The latest report has just come in from the front lines.
    Thanks to the efforts of the Allied infiltration unit, we've finally secured a direct line of attack against the enemy stronghold.${prompt}
  10891: |-
    The Allied Forces will move against Castle Zvahl with the full brunt of its strength.
    I will personally lead the Republican Army in support of this offensive.${prompt}
  10892: |-
    I would have you march with me.
    Under normal circumstances, you'd have earned yourselves a rest for your efforts, but I'm afraid that is a luxury we cannot afford.${prompt}
  10893: Mister President...does this mean--?${prompt}
  10894: By presidential decree, the Mythril Musketeers are hereby reinstated in full.${prompt}
  10895: Zeid. Until such time as Captain Klara is fit to return to duty, I would have you serve as acting captain in her stead.${prompt}
  10896: |-
    Clearly, the bonds you share are as strong--nay, stronger--than the metal from which you take your name.
    Let these bonds of friendship be your strength, and even the darkest shadow will prove no match for you.${prompt}
  10897: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  10898: And you, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  10899: |-
    You hail from a distant realm, this I know.
    Despite this, you have made one sacrifice after the next in our Republic's name.${prompt}
  10900: It would be no exaggeration to say that without your unflagging efforts, Bastok would not stand as strong as it does today.${prompt}
  10901: As a token of my gratitude, I give you this.${prompt}
  10902: |-
    Furthermore, from this day forward you shall be a full-fledged member of the Mythril Musketeers.
    The Republic would have your strength for as long as it stands.${prompt}
  10903: Three cheers for Mythril Musketeer ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10904: |-
    They tell me our guardsman Gentle Tiger has dubbed you the Sixth Musketeer.
    I will do him one better: I hereby bestow upon you the designation of Mythril Musketeer Zero.${prompt}
  10905: |-
    A wayfarer from far-off lands you are, and yet serve our nation as loyally as any true Bastoker ever has.
    Never lose sight of your origins, for it is your unique background that allows you to serve us as no other can.${prompt}
  10906: |-
    Once a Mythril Musketeer, forever a Mythril Musketeer.
    The Republic is stronger for your presence, ${name-player}. Promise us that it will always be so.${prompt}
  10907: Simply incredible... Why, the zero designation is an honor that's been granted to only the most illustrious musketeers in the history of our unit.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    I must confess to feeling a bit of jealousy, ${name-player}.
    But just you wait: I fully expect to distinguish myself in the none-too-distant future!${prompt}
  10909: |-
    ${name-player}.
    It has been--and always will be--an honor to fight by your side.${prompt}
  10910: They say that in the days of the Great War, there was a hero of the Republic who distinguished ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] so highly that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was bestowed the title of Mythril Musketeer Zero by President Prien himself.${prompt}
  10911: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] identity was never made public, and ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] remains the only one to this day to receive the honor.
    What I wouldn't give for the chance to meet such a legend!${prompt}
  10912: This stupid thing is so damn complicated.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    “Come on, Naji!” “It'll be easy, Naji!”
    <Grumble> Why did I even agree to this?${prompt}
  10914: Who exactly volunteered me, anyway?${prompt}
  10915: And now I've got someone bothering me. What is it?${prompt}
  10916: By Altana! Someone has actually come to me about this “Trust” thing?${prompt}
  10917: Taking the buffalo by the horns, are we? I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule.${prompt}
  10918: Let me be up front with you--I've got absolutely no idea how this works. They told me something about trust and friendship, but what exactly is that supposed to mean?${prompt}
  10919: But if it works, you'll be able to summon an “alter ego” of me who'll fight by your side. And let's be honest--who better than me?${prompt}
  10920: That's what I'm led to believe, anyway. Pretty amazing stuff!${prompt}
  10921: But I don't know you from a crying street urchin, so it probably won't work. Tough luck, kid.${prompt}
  10922: And since we've been through some interesting times together, it might be crazy enough to work!${prompt}
  10923: You were sent on that reconnaissance mission to San d'Oria and Windurst at the behest of President Karst.${prompt}
  10924: You know I was posted to these gates to keep undesirables out of his hair, but I knew I could count on you, so I let you pass.${prompt}
  10925: Remember that time Grandma asked you to reforge my father's sword?${prompt}
  10926: You'd better still have that axe I gave you! Sure got me through some tough times over the years, and I'd sure hate to hear that it's shoved haphazardly in the back of your Mog Locker.${prompt}
  10927: That whole debacle with the King of Hearts and I in Aht Urhgan sure was a time to remember. You're lucky we managed to pull your ass out of the fire!${prompt}
  10928: You really gave me what for at that chocobo race, too. It's taken me a while to forgive you!${prompt}
  10929: |-
    “But, Naji, that was ages ago!”
    Bah! Next time you won't be so lucky!${prompt}
  10930: Ah, memories. If I were a weaker man, it might even bring me to tears.${prompt}
  10931: But this whole Trust magic ordeal...memories alone don't make strong bonds! You're going to need a bit more than that!${prompt}
  10932: Iron Eater always called me dumb as a tree stump and simple as a wooden spear, but I'll have you know I am both complex and intricate!${prompt}
  10933: So don't blame me if this fails. It's all on your head.${prompt}
  10934: Now, concentrate, my compatriot! Focus on your feelings of trust and friendship!${prompt}
  10935: |-
    If you won't believe in me, then believe in the fact that I believe in you!
    Wait, what did I just say?${prompt}
  10936: This is all that it took? That idiot Clarion Star gave such a long explanation “of sorts” that I was ready to stand here for hours and hours!${prompt}
  10937: But I'll be damned if this doesn't feel good. Let's try it out!${prompt}

  10939: Phew! That could have ended very badly. At least I can control the thing.${prompt}
  10940: Ha! Now I can guard two doors at the same time! Wait...why am I getting excited about that?${prompt}
  10941: I am the quintessential warrior, number five in the Mythril Musketeer hierarchy, and if I ever catch you referring to me as a doorman, I'll bite your head off!${prompt}
  10942: Ugggh...this “doorman” thing hits a little too close to home.${prompt}
  10943: I'm pumped and ready to go! Now, to catch Ayame and tell her how I really feel!${prompt}
  10944: |-
    Gah!
    I'm fine with this thing inheriting my many talents, but some things are better kept under wraps!${prompt}

  10946: |-
    Congratulations on your tremendous success!
    And before I forget, I've got to give this to you. You earned it, pal!${prompt}
  10947: You can use it to summon an alter ego of the strongest Mythril Musketeer--me--at any time. ${prompt}
  10948: Give it a shake outside of town. Maybe North or South Gustaberg, for instance. I'm sure you'll be more than pleased with the result.${prompt}
  10949: And far be it from me to confess my weakness...but I'm a bit curious as to whether it will actually work. Come back to me once you've tried it out.${prompt}
  10950: Tell me every last detail! Did my alter ego do the real me justice?${prompt}
  10951: |-
    How did it go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Couldn't be happier.
    Well...I'm not too impressed.${prompt}
  10952: Can't say that I'm surprised. When you're working with a man like me, of course you'll get great results. Now you know why Iron Eater chose who he did!${prompt}
  10953: “Not impressed”? Stop blathering on like a baby!${prompt}
  10954: How couldn't you be impressed by someone so complex and intricate?${prompt}
  10955: Be that as it may, if you need to learn more about Trust, just go back and ask Clarion Star. He seems to know a lot about this stuff.${prompt}
  10956: He kept muttering something about “latent potential” and “ongoing research” or what-have-you. I wasn't really paying attention.${prompt}
  10957: But what I did find interesting was that there are also people in other nations with their gaze trained on this program.${prompt}
  10958: If the whole process confounds me, then it's no surprise that there are people out there trying to figure out just how it works.${prompt}
  10959: But you don't need to cross the border to find out more. Some other people here in Bastok are participating, like...Ayame.${prompt}
  10960: She's number four here in the Mythril Musketeers, and I doubt she'd let just any old adventurer try out Trust magic with her.${prompt}
  10961: |-
    Y-you want me to ask her for you?
    No, no, I don't think that would be a good idea.${prompt}
  10962: She knows you pretty well by now. Just give her a quick kick for me when you go see her, hmm?${prompt}
  10963: |-
    There's something else I must give you: this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    Well, there's nothing more you need from me here.${prompt}
  10964: You've got what you came for. Just make sure to treat my alter ego well, or I'll have to hunt you down--and you won't be happy when I find you!${prompt}
  10965: |-
    It is a pleasure to...
    Oh? You have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}
  10966: I am assisting the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies in gathering data on this new “Trust magic.”${prompt}
  10967: One of my duties as a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers is to ensure that we are ready for any eventuality--and it is my firm belief that this new discovery may serve us well.${prompt}
  10968: It is my fervent hope that it will aid us in our struggles against the Beastman Confederate. If not, perhaps it can at least be used to assist with some of our more menial tasks.${prompt}
  10969: If possible, I would like to enlist your aid in this endeavor.${prompt}
  10970: But unfortunately, it seems this magic would require a bond between us, a bond we do not yet share.${prompt}
  10971: 'There are other things you must take care of first. I wish you the best in your efforts to protect ${choice: 5}[Bastok/your homeland].${prompt}'
  10972: The very fact that you have chosen to visit me this day can only mean one thing. You wish to see whether you can call forth my alter ego.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Let's give this a shot.
    Not at the moment.${prompt}
  10974: I would urge you to reconsider. This city requires more strength and resolve; the last thing it needs is more Najis.${prompt}
  10975: Remember that this magic draws on the power of deeply personal bonds. Bonds which can both steady the heart and set it to racing.${prompt}
  10976: Let us think back once more to all that has transpired between us.${prompt}
  10977: You rescued me from the terrifying clutches of a dragon in Waughroon Shrine.${prompt}
  10978: My alter ego is but a reflection of myself. Should you succeed in calling out to her, she will surely remember your deeds.${prompt}
  10979: '${choice: 2}[You aided me when Volker chose to give up his position as the head of our troupe./You also aided me when Volker chose to give up his position as the head of our troupe.]${prompt}'
  10980: The only reason the Musketeers were able to reclaim their former glory was due to your valiant efforts during the battle between Zeid and our leader.${prompt}
  10981: '${choice: 2}[I remember now./And there''s more.] You ${choice: 2}[/also ]helped me during that incident with Viresefilant when I made one of my journeys to Norg.${prompt}'
  10982: Our efforts in that case bore certain fruit. We were able to confirm the details of an agreement vital to Bastokan interests.${prompt}
  10983: |-
    Would only that the dark underbelly of Bastok had not been exposed to you in the process...
    One day I hope to bring it to its rightful conclusion.${prompt}
  10984: 'Oh, ${choice: 2}[/and ]I would be loath to forget my younger sister, Kaede. My father mentioned that it was your help that guided my sister down her path.${prompt}'
  10985: Sometimes I talk with her about my mother...and somehow, your name always comes up.${prompt}
  10986: '${choice: 2}[You know,/And what''s more,] Naji told me of your momentous exploits over in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}'
  10987: I'm quite sure his role was less significant than he made it out to be, and we truly have you to thank for how things turned out.${prompt}
  10988: My heart skipped a beat when I heard that the airship came tumbling down like a boulder rolled off a cliff.${prompt}
  10989: Who could forget when you vanquished Huu Xalmo the Savage, displaying your true prowess as one of the finest monks in the land?${prompt}
  10990: You have taken the path my predecessor Cornelia took and made it your own. As a member of the Mythril Musketeers, I understand like no other what that decision means.${prompt}
  10991: How could I forget that you beat Infinity XIII!?${prompt}
  10992: You remember--during the chocobo races. To think that I lost after all the effort I put into my chocobo's care. But it was a battle well-fought, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.${prompt}
  10993: '${choice: 2}[The/Further, the] flashing dance of blades in Delkfutt''s Tower taught me more about swordsmanship than I ever thought possible. One dream of mine is that we may sometime spar again as we did that day.${prompt}'
  10994: Who else could have felled so many in such a short period of time? There was a spark in your eyes and a spring in your step that few can hope to replicate.${prompt}
  10995: '${choice: 2}[So let me ask,/Since you are here,] what called you to participate in this grand experiment?${prompt}'
  10996: You need not respond. I spoke for your benefit, not my own.${prompt}
  10997: |-
    Remember those feelings.
    Close your eyes. Concentrate. Think.${prompt}
  10998: I had faith in you, ${name-player}, and you truly shone brightly.${prompt}
  10999: A fitting conclusion, given all we have been through. Now you know what it is like to have a true bond with someone.${prompt}
  11000: 'I see, adventurer. You have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in your possession.${prompt}'
  11001: As you are surely aware, the Mythril Musketeers have elected to participate in the Trust initiative on behalf of the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies.${prompt}
  11002: 'Would that we could do more, but we are currently engaged with matters relevant to Bastok''s national security. I would ask you to aid ${choice: 5}[us/your home nation] in the struggle against the Beastman Confederate first.${prompt}'
  11003: You've come at the perfect time.${prompt}
  11004: I, Volker, serve the Mythril Musketeers as its captain.${prompt}
  11005: I hereby permit you to engage in the Trust ritual with me.${prompt}
  11006: But first, a word of warning. Ayame and Naji always complain that I am prone to giving boring lectures. My alter ego, naturally, would be cut from the same cloth. Are you still sure you wish to engage in this bonding nevertheless?${prompt}
  11007: |-
    Attempt the ritual?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11008: Everyone calls me a big complainer, but I wouldn't be this way if it wasn't for a certain Number Five...${prompt}
  11009: |-
    You will?
    That alone proves you feel a strong bond between us.${prompt}
  11010: Well, at the very least, I feel a strong bond with you. How could I not, after you vanquished the Shadow Lord in Castle Zvahl?${prompt}
  11011: And, of course, you also heard what went on between Werei and me.${prompt}
  11012: I can still feel him watching over me to this day.${prompt}
  11013: Yes, even though he felt that ascending to the rank of captain was Zeid's right.${prompt}
  11014: What's more, afterward you found what lay deep within the recesses of despair and hatred. I found myself with nothing but the utmost respect for you.${prompt}
  11015: There was also the time when I confronted Zeid...no, my own past in Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11016: It was thanks to you that I was able to clear my mind of all doubts.${prompt}
  11017: Whenever I look back on what transpired there, I cannot help but see your face.${prompt}
  11018: Another reason why I have so much trust in you is your long list of exploits in Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  11019: You took good care of Naji--although if you ask him, it was he who looked after you.${prompt}
  11020: I'd also like to thank you for everything you taught me in the Stellar Fulcrum.${prompt}
  11021: People are always telling me that I'm forgettable...but I think I proved them wrong that day.${prompt}
  11022: So from now on, I demand to be referred to as “somber.”${prompt}
  11023: But I suppose you didn't come here to be talked at for hours on end.${prompt}
  11024: I've said my piece. It's time for us to commence the ritual.${prompt}
  11025: Close your eyes and concentrate.${prompt}
  11026: Yes! I had faith in you, ${name-player}, but this is wonderful!${prompt}

  11138: Oh... I see you've met her already.${prompt}
  11139: Yeah, I heard the story about an amazing shield that boosts one's crafting ability just by equipping it. I never thought such a thing could be possible.${prompt}
  11140: I'd be curious to see if it actually works or not.${prompt}
  11141: I know you're quite skilled, and if she picked you, I guess it means you've got what it takes to make the shield.${prompt}
  11142: Alright then. Let's get you the recipe. Make sure you don't forget it, you hear?${prompt}
  11143: 'Okay, you''ll need some ingredients to get started. First on the list is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11144: 'It''s necessary to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its max value.${prompt}'
  11145: I've actually got some notes on Craftsmanship here. I'll go over 'em quickly with you before we continue.${prompt}
  11146: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  11147: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you have trouble.${prompt}
  11148: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  11149: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  11150: That's all it says.${prompt}
  11151: 'Come and see me when you get the Craftsmanship up. I''ll get that ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  11152: 'Next, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I''ve given them to Esvin.${prompt}'
  11153: You've made deliveries before, right? That's what you'll need to do to get the ingredients.${prompt}
  11154: You can talk to Esvin for more details.${prompt}
  11155: That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after you've upgraded it. I want to see what all the fuss is about.${prompt}
  11156: Huh? You forgot the recipe? Fine. Here's the list of ingredients again. Try to remember it this time.${prompt}
  11157: Well, I guess I've never had any complaints with you. You know what you're doing, so I'm certain you can pull it off.${prompt}
  11158: 'Wow, this is quite impressive. I ought to be able to craft the ${item-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt}'
  11159: 'Okay, here''s the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11160: I poured my craftsman's spirit into the shield and it made this crystal. I've got no idea how it all works, but it's pretty amazing, no?${prompt}
  11161: 'Although, by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]} has decreased.${prompt}'
  11162: 'I guess it''s not a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you''ll need to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to craft ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} again.${prompt}'
  11163: Of course, I know you'd never do anything as stupid as to lose this. Hahaha.${prompt}
  11164: 'Hey! Are you trying to tell me you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?!${prompt}'
  11165: 'I guess it can''t be helped. Here, I''ll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  11166: You're one of my greatest rivals in this business. You should know to take proper care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  11167: I see you've made the upgrade. Let me see what you've got there.${prompt}
  11168: Hmm... It looks different, and it's even giving off a faint energy. It still doesn't seem to be complete though.${prompt}
  11169: I guess you're gonna have to craft with it multiple times to get the best results. She probably already told you that though.${prompt}
  11170: Oh yeah. You needed some kind of proof that the shield was made. Wait just a moment.${prompt}
  11171: That oughta do it.${prompt}
  11172: Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.${prompt}
  11173: By the way, I've always got deliveries to be made to Esvin. I hope you'll help me bring up the guild's newer members.${prompt}
  11174: Oh! You brought the shield with you. You must be here to upgrade it.${prompt}
  11175: I got the recipe, so let's take a look at it.${prompt}
  11176: That's it.${prompt}
  11177: 'Now for the ingredients... First, you''ll need to start with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11178: 'You equipped the aspis when you made the ecu, right? This is basically the same thing. You''ll need to craft items while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11179: That'll increase its Craftsmanship for ya. Just keep at it until it reaches 100%.${prompt}
  11180: 'Come back when you''re done and I''ll prepare the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for ya.${prompt}'
  11181: 'After that, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I''ve given both of them to Esvin.${prompt}'
  11182: 'Last up is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. For this one, I''ve enlisted the help of the A.M.A.N. There''re a number of Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.${prompt}'
  11183: 'Check the Records of Eminence for more details. If you see the objectives through to the end, you''ll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  11184: That's it for the ingredients. It might be a bit tough, but I know you're up to the challenge.${prompt}
  11185: Ahh, it looks like you've brought the shield's Craftsmanship up.${prompt}
  11186: 'Okay, let''s get you that ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11187: Here you go!${prompt}
  11188: 'Oh, it looks like making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}'
  11189: It takes a lot of work to get the shield's Craftsmanship up. So don't go do something stupid like losing this thing.${prompt}
  11190: This shield is really amazing. I wish I could carry it in my shop. Whaddya say? Interested in selling it to me?${prompt}
  11191: Hahaha! Just kidding. Seriously though, this shield possesses immense power. I look forward to seeing just how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  11192: Now, let's get you that proof that the shield is finished.${prompt}
  11193: I really hate to see this thing go... Take it over to Mewk Chorosap before I change my mind.${prompt}
  11194: I don't believe this... Fine, get out there and that final objective again!${prompt}
  11195: Ahh, it's good to see ya! Let's hurry up and get you that recipe.${prompt}
  11196: Hm? You already know the recipe? Oh, sorry about that. Is there something else you want to check?${prompt}
  11197: 'You want to know how to get the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}? I''ve got them, but I''m not gonna just give ''em to ya for free.${prompt}'
  11198: The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various products. I could use your help making the items and then delivering them to the customer.${prompt}
  11199: But keep in mind that the customer is demanding the items be made nearby. I guess it's in order to keep an eye on the quality of the finished goods.${prompt}
  11200: In other words, you can only deliver that which they've seen you craft. Although, products used for repairs can be taken directly to them.${prompt}
  11201: You'll need to gather the materials needed to make the item yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, but there is at least a bit of good news for ya.${prompt}
  11202: It's still in the trial phase, but the guilds have agreed on a system to sell certain items that were previously unavailable. It might make it easier for you to get certain materials.${prompt}
  11203: Speak to the vendor in charge of crafting sets within each guild to see the available items. Of course, you'll need to pay for them first.${prompt}
  11204: But, note that you might not always be able to buy what you need. Each guild has its own set of rules.${prompt}

    Were you summoned to the meeting?${prompt}
  11389: |-
    But you were the one who defeated Do'Bho Venomtail!
    It's not fair to leave you out of this!${prompt}
  11390: Yes, I also believe that ${name-player} has a right to know the truth.${prompt}
  11391: Iron Eater, would you mind explaining it to ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt}
  11392: |-
    First of all, our investigation at the Zeruhn Mines went exactly as we expected.
    The Quadav forces came down the river from the Palborough Mines.${prompt}
  11393: Witnesses at the scene say that the Quadav were chasing something.${prompt}
  11394: Meanwhile, three beastmen led by a Goblin clad in black were seen racing toward the Bastok Mines.${prompt}
  11395: |-
    What!? A black-clad Goblin?
    Surely, it must've been...${prompt}
  11396: |-
    Who was it?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Gloom Phantom.
    The Destiny Destroyers.
    Zeid.${prompt}
  11397: |-
    Yes, that's the one!
    You're absolutely right!${prompt}
  11398: |-
    Yes, that's them!
    The group consisting of the Gloom Phantom and his friends!${prompt}
  11399: Huh!? Sure, he wears black, but I don't think it was him.${prompt}
  11400: No, I'm talking about the Gloom Phantom.${prompt}
  11401: Yes, we were thinking the same thing, so we talked to Raebrimm, who was previously a target of theirs.${prompt}
  11402: |-
    However, we did not really learn anything new.
    It appears that Raebrimm is not involved.${prompt}
  11403: |-
    Yes, that makes sense...
    The Destiny Destroyers were satisfied once they got that eggshell, right?${prompt}
  11404: Although, their real objective was the egg, and we're still not sure about the reason why.${prompt}
  11405: Did you find out anything, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  11406: |-
    What will you talk about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Yagudo and Orc conspiracy.
    The Destiny Destroyers.
    The “World Eater Egg.”${prompt}
  11407: |-
    What's that you say?
    The Yagudo were searching for the egg in Windurst!?${prompt}
  11408: And an Orcish unit was dispatched to San d'Oria...${prompt}
  11409: |-
    So these beastmen are all trying to steal the egg for themselves.
    That means the Quadav probably are as well...${prompt}
  11410: You're talking about that trio that showed up where the egg was?${prompt}
  11411: And they worked together alongside the Orcs in the Northlands to break open the egg.${prompt}
  11412: |-
    So, if they've shown up here, then that means...
    Wait, could the egg be somewhere near Bastok?${prompt}
  11413: If so, then that might mean they're here to break open this egg for themselves.${prompt}
  11414: |-
    Some legendary egg that gives untold power if broken open?
    I find it all rather hard to believe.${prompt}
  11415: Fortunately, if what you say is true, then that power is not so easily obtained.${prompt}
  11416: |-
    That Orc was destroyed when he broke open the egg.
    I suppose the power was too much for him to bear.${prompt}
  11417: |-
    What if someone capable of wielding that power were to appear?
    The mere thought of such a thing terrifies me.${prompt}
  11418: We must inform Sir Lucius about this matter immediately.${prompt}
  11419: |-
    I must tell my father about this “World Eater Egg” right away.
    The Quadav can wait.${prompt}
  11420: No, my lady. Like the other beastmen, the Quadav are also hoping to harness the egg's power.${prompt}
  11421: In fact, they may have already obtained that power.${prompt}
  11422: |-
    So you mean they purposely showed up at the Zeruhn Mines in order to provoke us?
    That they are hoping to start a war?${prompt}
  11423: First, they lead the Republican military to the Palborough Mines, where they can use the egg's overwhelming power...${prompt}
  11424: Wait just a moment, Sir Volker, Iron Eater...${prompt}
  11425: Do you mean to say that my father intends to start a war?${prompt}
  11426: Um...${prompt}
  11427: |-
    I know that the Quadav are our sworn enemy.
    However, we must remain calm if we are to avoid needless bloodshed.${prompt}
  11428: |-
    Naturally, there are many who share your opinion, my lady.
    Whether they can sway the opinion of the Senate, however...${prompt}
  11429: We have to at least try! Once we set down the path to war, there's no turning back!${prompt}
  11430: They say victory favors those who move first.${prompt}
  11431: I realize I may be a young girl who knows little of the ways of the world...${prompt}
  11432: |-
    However, that is also why I can say what needs to be said.
    There are things that people must know if we are to go to war.${prompt}
  11433: What if you were to enlist ${name-player}'s services, my lady?${prompt}
  11434: Yes, that is an excellent idea.${prompt}
  11435: |-
    Please, ${name-player}!
    Can you go investigate the Palborough Mines for us?${prompt}
  11436: |-
    We need to know if the Quadav have acquired the “World Eater Egg” or the power it holds within.
    And if not, we need to know what their plans are.${prompt}
  11437: You must help us decide whether Bastok needs to engage the Quadav in all-out war.${prompt}
  11438: |-
    Will you agree to the request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'll do it.
    Sorry, I can't help you.${prompt}
  11439: |-
    You have the gratitude of our entire nation.
    I shall go and speak to my father.${prompt}
  11440: Additionally, I shall speak to everyone involved with this incident to see if we are missing anything.${prompt}
  11441: Until we meet again!
  11442: |-
    You must help us! This matter concerns you too!
    We can't let ourselves go blindly into war!${prompt}
  11443: |-
    If the Senate decides to go to war, there is little that can be done.
    However, I do wish to avoid any unnecessary harm to the republic.${prompt}
  11444: I wish you luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11445: |-
    Head to the Palborough Mines and find out whether the Quadav have obtained the “World Eater Egg” or not.
    We also need you to find out what they're up to.${prompt}
  11446: |-
    Please carry out our lady's request as quickly as you are able.
    There might not be much time remaining.${prompt}
  11447: |-
    Ah, you're back at last.
    The good lady has eagerly awaited your return.${prompt}
  11448: I most definitely have!
  11449: |-
    You must tell us about the Quadav at once!
    Before it's too late!${prompt}
  11450: I knew it! The Quadav that appeared at the Zeruhn Mines weren't part of some assassination squad!${prompt}
  11451: So just as we thought, they were chasing after the Destiny Destroyers, yes?${prompt}
  11452: When they broke open the “World Eater Egg,” the Quadav's eggs were consumed...${prompt}
  11453: It's only natural that they'd be out for blood.${prompt}
  11454: Can we really be sure that the Quadav weren't after the power contained within the “World Eater Egg” for themselves?${prompt}
  11455: I think so. Besides, if they were truly planning to use its power, I think they would've used the scorpion to their advantage too.${prompt}
  11456: But the Quadav were also trying to kill the scorpion.${prompt}
  11457: That makes sense. I think we might just be able to convince the president...${prompt}
  11458: |-
    That's excellent news!
    Now we can forget about this stupid war with the Quadav!${prompt}
  11459: However, that mage who absorbed the power from the mind-warped scorpion is sure to be a problem.${prompt}
  11460: |-
    Hm!? You're talking about the Tarutaru mage Uran-Mafran!
    Is he a mage from the Federation of Windurst?${prompt}
  11461: If so, then Bastok's enemy is not the Quadav, but possibly the Federation of Windurst instead.${prompt}
  11462: It's okay... That's still just conjecture.${prompt}
  11463: Like we did with the Quadav, we just need to find out the truth of the matter.${prompt}
  11464: You're right. Now then, we need to find out more about this mage known as Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  11465: |-
    I'll get Captain Volker up to speed on everything that's happened.
    After that, I want you and him to speak with the president...${prompt}
  11466: Understood!${prompt}
  11467: Although, before I go to speak with Volker...${prompt}
  11468: |-
    Please, take this present from me.
    I always cook whenever I'm worried about something...${prompt}
  11469: Also, there's something I must tell you.${prompt}
  11470: You have my utmost gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11471: Thanks to your help, I was able to achieve the outcome I believed to be just.${prompt}
  11472: Hey, do you remember what I told you before?${prompt}
  11473: |-
    “There is a lot more of this country that I want to learn about.
    And maybe someday I can become somebody who will represent the people and bring change to Bastok.”${prompt}
  11474: I have grown since then. Now, it isn't just this country that I wish to know more about, but the world itself.${prompt}
  11475: |-
    And once I do, I want to help the people of this country even more.
    I think I can help my father as well.${prompt}
  11476: |-
    I feel as if all this has enabled me to take a first step on that path.
    That is my duty as the President's daughter...${prompt}
  11477: |-
    At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause.
    Don't worry though, I've got it handled.${prompt}
  11478: Furthermore, I think I understand what my father means when he says the following...${prompt}
  11479: |-
    “I won't let anyone stand in my way.”
    He doesn't like people who don't back up their words with action.${prompt}
  11480: |-
    Therefore, I need to show him, not just tell him.
    That is my duty as my father's daughter.${prompt}
  11481: |-
    One day, I'll make him see it for himself...
    He'll see that trusting his daughter is the right thing to do.${prompt}
  11482: |-
    At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause.
    Don't worry though, I've got it handled.${prompt}
  11483: |-
    Lady Cornelia left this with me.
    Here, it's yours.${prompt}
  11484: |-
    I asked Ayame to look into the mage known as Uran-Mafran.
    She has connections in Norg, so she's perfect for the task.${prompt}
  11485: |-
    As for the president, that's up to the good captain and Lady Cornelia...
    I think it should turn out okay.${prompt}
  11486: |-
    Although, there are still many unanswered questions about this “World Eater Egg.”
    I'm not sure how the Mithril Musketeers should respond.${prompt}
  11487: Thanks to you, we have received valuable information from the Palborough Mines.${prompt}
  11488: |-
    I have asked plenty of questions, but there is still much I do not understand.
    In times like these, it is important to proceed with caution.${prompt}
  11489: |-
    Hey, did you hear the news?
    Ayame has been given an important mission from Sir Iron Eater.${prompt}
  11490: |-
    Yet I get stuck here tending to the wounded.
    I know it's important work too, but...${prompt}
