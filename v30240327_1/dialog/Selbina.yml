  6716: Bien sûr, j’ai entendu la nouvelle. Il a dit que c’était si précieux pour lui que son visage est devenu bleu !${prompt}
  6717: Oui...pauvre type ! Il doit être au fond de la mer maintenant. Je me sens mal pour lui, mais il ne le reverra plus jamais.${prompt}
  6718: Ne faites pas attention à moi. J’ai beaucoup de choses à penser et... Hein ? Oh, vous avez entendu parler de ma bague, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  6719: Je l’ai déposé près de la jetée et c’est juste... Il m'était si cher. Je ne sais pas quoi faire.${prompt}
  6720: Je donnerais n’importe quoi pour récupérer ma bague. Rien! Mais l’océan l’a englouti pour toujours. C’est perdu.${prompt}

  6755: C’était un aventurier, comme vous. Ses voyages l’ont emmené très loin et, lentement, il a étoffé ses cartes.${prompt}
  6756: Un jour, j’ai découvert que des monuments en pierre portant ses paroles se trouvent à divers endroits dans le monde.${prompt}

  6815: De nos jours, nous, marchands ambulants, nous battons pour notre survie. Mais nous ne pouvons pas simplement renoncer à nos moyens de subsistance. Après tout, les choses n’ont pas toujours été comme ça.${prompt}

  6821: Peut-être que vous pourriez y aller à la place. Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
  6822: Merci. Les tortues frappent souvent les marchands se dirigeant vers notre village. Une autre caravane a été attaquée l’autre jour.${prompt}
  6823: Ils ont pris la fuite, mais deux d’entre eux ont été faits prisonniers.${prompt}
  6824: Les tortues qui rôdaient dehors venaient des Beadeaux. Nous pensons que les marchands y sont retenus captifs.${prompt}
  6825: Leurs noms sont Evrard et Serafin.${prompt}
  6826: On dit que les tortues maintiennent les prisonniers enfermés hermétiquement. Quelque part à Beadeaux, il devrait y avoir un tel endroit.${prompt}
  6827: Les marchands qui l’ont fabriqué ici ont dit qu’ils étaient différents des autres tortues. J’espère que cela vous aidera.${prompt}
  6828: Je déteste demander aux autres de faire notre travail, mais s’il vous plaît, sauvez les deux captifs. Leurs familles en ont besoin.${prompt}

  6842: Je suis heureux que vous cherchez ma sagesse, mon enfant, mais vous êtes quand même trop insensible.${prompt}
  6843: Moi aussi, j’ai pris les armes pour l’honneur et la patrie. Mais tout cela a été en vain.${prompt}
  6844: J’ai aidé à défendre la nation. J’ai goûté à la gloire. Mais derrière leurs sourires, les gens devenaient jaloux. J’ai perdu ma famille et mes camarades m’ont abandonné.${prompt}
  6845: Bientôt, j’ai réalisé que tout ce que j'avais fait, tout ce pour quoi je me battais était en vain. J’ai quitté les rangs pour de bon.${prompt}
  6846: Mais ces derniers temps, les hommes-bêtes relèvent le défi. Encore une fois, beaucoup risquent de perdre des amis et des membres de leur famille à cause des tempêtes de la guerre.${prompt}
  6847: J’ai alors pensé à empêcher qu’une telle tragédie ne se reproduise. Heureusement, une réponse m’est venue.${prompt}

  6857: Splendide. Comme promis, je vais maintenant vous enseigner une compétence des plus précieuses. J’appelle cela un « job de soutien ». Écoutez bien pour connaître ses secrets.${prompt}
  6858: Les jobs de soutien sont entrepris partout où vous changez habituellement de job. Et vous devez déjà maîtriser une job avant de pouvoir le déclarer comme job de soutien.${prompt}
  6859: 'De plus, le niveau effectif de votre job de support ne pourra jamais dépasser ${color: 5}half${color: 1} celui de votre job principal. De plus, comme il ne s’agit que d’un travail d’accompagnement, vous n’avancerez jamais grâce à l’expérience..${prompt}'
  6860: Je vais donner un exemple. Disons que vous avez atteint le niveau 20 en tant que guerrier et le niveau 10 en tant que mage blanc. Vous déclareriez évidemment votre job principal de guerrier et votre job de soutien de mage blanc.${prompt}
  6861: Dans cet exemple, vous combattez en tant que guerrier de niveau 20 et en tant que mage blanc de 10 niveaux plus bas. Ainsi, vous effectueriez les deux tâches à leur potentiel maximum.${prompt}
  6862: En revanche, si vous aviez déclaré le mage blanc comme job principal et le guerrier comme job de soutien, les choses seraient bien différentes !${prompt}
  6863: Puisque vous n’auriez que 10 niveaux d’expérience en tant que mage blanc, votre potentiel en tant que guerrier serait réduit de moitié par rapport à votre job principal. Donc 5 ! Ce n’est pas une sage décision, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  6864: De même, vous ne voudriez pas faire de votre travail d’assistance quelque chose que vous n’avez jamais fait auparavant. Si votre niveau de job de soutien est inférieur à la moitié de celui de votre job principal, vos compétences sous-développées ne feront aucune différence. Souvenez-vous-en bien !${prompt}
  6865: Je vous recommande de choisir un job de support qui couvre les faiblesses de votre job principal, ou qui valorise ses points forts.${prompt}

  6896: Certains poissons ont de mauvaises habitudes alimentaires. Vous savez, comme celui qui a avalé la bague ?${prompt}
  6897: Ouais, c’est de ça que je parle. Apportez-moi du poisson comme ça. Je vais l’éviscérer et vérifier ses entrailles pour vous.${prompt}
  6898: Si je trouve quelque chose, c’est à vous. Quoi qu’il en soit, je vous achèterai le poisson, mais je ne peux pas payer autant que n’importe quel magasin de fantaisie.${prompt}
  6899: C’est à vous de décider. Vous voulez de l’argent, allez à la guilde. Mais si vous voulez poursuivre vos rêves, venez me voir !${prompt}
  6900: Passez nous voir de temps en temps. Je vais vous dire quel genre de poisson vous pouvez attraper.${prompt}
  6901: 'Essayer ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, et ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Ce sont tous des poissons qui aiment avaler des trucs. Quelqu’un de votre talent pourrait facilement en attraper un.${prompt}'
  6902: 'Quelqu’un de votre talent pourrait attraper ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, et ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Ils aiment tous avaler des trucs.${prompt}'

  6906: Vous en avez attrapé un, hein ? Attends une minute, je vais le vider et voir.${prompt}
  6907: Hmm... Non, rien ici. Continue d’essayer, ${choice-player-gender}[copain/dame]. Je suis sûr que vous aurez bientôt de la chance.${prompt}

    Qui a fait cette?
    ${selection-lines}
    C'était Rycharde.
    Je ne suis pas sûr.${prompt}

    Quoi? Rycharde a fait ça ? Rien de lui ne vaut la peine d'être mangé !
    Oh pourquoi pas? Juste un avant-goût...${prompt}
  6913: C’est quoi cette poubelle !? C'est à peine comestible ! Je savais qu’il ne savait pas cuisiner !${prompt}
  6914: Dis-lui quelque chose pour moi. Dites-lui qu’il devrait arrêter de cuisiner pour de bon !${prompt}
  6915: Eh bien, je ne prendrai rien tant que je ne saurai pas qui l’a envoyé. Dites-moi !${prompt}
  6916: Et maintenant ? Je n’ai rien à vous dire. Bonne journée !${prompt}
  6917: Encore vous ! Qu’est-ce qu’il y a cette fois? Je préfère mourir plutôt que de manger encore de sa bouffe !${prompt}
  6918: Quoi ? Vous voulez que je cuisine quelque chose ? Je suis sûr que vous ne faites rien de bon, mais en tant que chef, je ne peux pas vous refuser. ${prompt}
  6919: Très bien, alors ! Je vais préparer votre petit plat, mais vous devez d’abord m’apporter les ingrédients dont j’ai besoin.${prompt}
  6920: 'J’aurai besoin ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous!${prompt}'
  6921: Où sont ces ingrédients ? Je ne peux pas commencer sans eux !${prompt}
  6922: Hmph. Alors vous les avez trouvés, n’est-ce pas ? Bien! Viens me voir demain. Il devrait être prêt d’ici là.${prompt}
  6923: Et maintenant ? Ce n’est pas encore fait ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, mes plats sont toujours prêts à temps.${prompt}
  6924: Terminé ! Maintenant, prenez-le et sortez d’ici !${prompt}
  6925: Et maintenant ? C’est fait, alors laissez-moi tranquille !${prompt}
  6926: Oh, encore vous. J’espère que vous avez aimé le plat.${prompt}
  6927: Quoi, encore vous ? Eh bien, je ne vais pas vous châtier. Très bien, je vais y jeter un oeil. Donnez-moi un moment.${prompt}
  6928: C’est vrai qu'il s’est amélioré. Mais il ne parvient toujours pas à maîtriser les bases de la cuisine. Il y a bien plus que marchander des ingrédients !${prompt}
  6929: Tout a un fondement, pas seulement la cuisine. Faire du bien à l’extérieur est facile ; c'est ce qu'il y a à l’intérieur qui compte.${prompt}
  6930: Ce n’est que lorsqu'on a compris les bases qu’on peut rendre l’intérieur bon. Ce sont les amateurs qui se dépêchent le plus ; trop souvent, ils se concentrent sur l’apparence.${prompt}
  6931: Rycharde en est le parfait exemple. Il n’est tout simplement pas le prodige que j’espérais.${prompt}
  6932: C’est peut-être mon fils, mais il ne sera jamais un chef à mes yeux. Eh bien, ce n’est pas une conférence pour vous.${prompt}
  6933: Vous rentrez maintenant ? S’il vous plaît, donnez-lui ceci. Dis-lui que c'est ma réponse. S’il ne comprend pas ce que cela signifie, alors ce sera tout.${prompt}
  6934: Vous le lui avez donné, n’est-ce pas ? J’espère qu’il a compris.${prompt}
  6935: 'Vous le lui avez donné, n’est-ce pas ? À l’époque où j’ai commencé à lui apprendre à cuisiner, je lui faisais souvent utiliser ${item-plural: 0[2]} dans ses plats.${prompt}'
  6936: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} venir à bas prix ces derniers temps. Mais cela ne les exclut pas comme ingrédients.${prompt}'
  6937: Vous pouvez également utiliser des ingrédients coûteux, et même si vos ustensiles sont médiocres, vos aliments auront toujours bon goût.${prompt}
  6938: Les plats délicieux ne sont pas préparés à partir d’épices ou de couverts sophistiqués. Cela ne provient pas non plus d’une analyse méthodique.${prompt}
  6939: En effet, rien n’est plus crucial que le désir de satisfaire les autres avec de la bonne nourriture et d’imaginer des moyens d’y parvenir.${prompt}
  6940: Si seulement mon fils pouvait réaliser cela, il y aurait peut-être encore un espoir pour lui.${prompt}
  6941: La cuisine est un art complexe, mais les bases sont aussi claires que le jour. Je suppose que cela vaut pour à peu près tout.${prompt}
  6942: N’oubliez jamais de rendre grâce à chaque repas. Les mains de nombreuses personnes travaillent dur pour nous apporter notre subsistance.${prompt}
  6943: Bonjour. Je m’appelle Mathilde et mon père dirige cette boutique de guilde.${prompt}
  6944: Nous vendons uniquement des produits qu’il sélectionne lui-même. Alors soyez tranquille en sachant que vous obtenez des produits de qualité à chaque fois que vous magasinez ! ${prompt}
  6945: Pourquoi, bonjour. Ma fille et moi tenons à nouveau le fort. Oh, mon mari est toujours dehors pour surveiller ses précieux moutons.${prompt}
  6946: Ma fille Mathilde s’est mariée il y a environ cinq ans. Elle nous a donné un petit-fils, et c’est un si bon petit garçon !${prompt}
  6947: Je dis toujours à mon mari à quel point nous avons de la chance !${prompt}
  6948: Mais vous voyez, Mathilde est adoptée. Cependant, tout le monde dit que nous nous entendons mieux que la plupart des vraies familles.${prompt}
  6949: Mon mari l’a découverte sur une route commerciale alors qu’elle n'était qu’une enfant et l’a ramenée à la maison avec lui. Je ne peux pas croire que vingt ans puissent passer si vite !${prompt}
  6950: Le fait est qu’elle n’avait aucun souvenir de son passé. Elle ne se souvenait même pas de son nom. Elle ne semblait blessée nulle part, elle avait donc dû traverser une terrible épreuve. Pauvre petite chose...${prompt}
  6951: Mon mari pense que sa famille était la proie de monstres et qu’elle était la seule survivante. Le monde entier était alors en guerre, et de telles tragédies étaient monnaie courante.${prompt}
  6952: Elle ne se souvient toujours de rien de cette époque. Rien, à part le nom d'un certain garçon. Il devait être une personne très importante pour elle.${prompt}
  6953: Re-bonjour. Nous avons beaucoup de belles choses aujourd’hui. Prenez votre temps !${prompt}
  6954: Je suis à la maison !${prompt}
  6955: Bonjour, Aldo.${prompt}
  6956: Maman, regarde ! J’ai trouvé ça sur la plage. C’est pour toi !${prompt}
  6957: Quel joli coquillage ! Merci.
  6958: Ashtia m’attend. Je dois y aller !${prompt}
  6959: Fait attention !${prompt}
  6960: Fait-le toujours !${prompt}
  6961: Je t’en chercherai un aussi, grand-mère !${prompt}
  6962: Pourquoi merci, Aldo. Ce serait bien.${prompt}
  6963: Il va et vient comme un cyclone, ce garçon !${prompt}
  6964: Mon petit trésor, cet Aldo. Où pourrait être mon autre précieux Aldo ? Il pourrait être là quelque part...${prompt}
  6965: 'Non, il doit être là-bas. Il mène une vie heureuse quelque part. Regardez-nous : nous vivons si loin les uns des autres sous le même ciel.${prompt}'
  6966: Content de te voir. Une fois que tu auras mon âge, tu réaliseras que tu dois travailler sinon tu ne sortiras jamais du lit.${prompt}
  6967: Vous avez rencontré Aldo, n’est-ce pas ? N’est-il pas un si gentil petit garçon ? Je dis toujours à mon mari à quel point nous sommes bénis pour un enfant et un petit-enfant !${prompt}
  6968: Vous voulez quelque chose ? Je suis pêcheur ici depuis la nuit des temps ! Bien sûr, j'ai aussi quelques activités annexes.${prompt}
  6969: Si vous souhaitez en apprendre davantage sur la pêche, demandez simplement à Gabwaleid. Il n’en a pas l’air, mais il en sait beaucoup. Je lui ai tout appris ! Haha ! 
  6970: Que puis-je faire pour vous ? Je m'appelle Gabwaleid. Un jour, je veux être un vrai pêcheur comme Zaldon.${prompt}
  6971: Il faut choisir le bon appât en fonction du poisson que l’on souhaite attraper. Sinon, c’est du gaspillage !${prompt}
  6972: Vous devez également être conscient de l’heure de la journée et de la météo. Essayez de pêcher au meilleur moment et dans les meilleures conditions météorologiques.${prompt}
  6973: Vous attraperez des poissons différents selon l’endroit où vous vous trouvez. Bien sûr, il y a une grande différence entre pêcher en rivière et en mer.${prompt}
  6974: Oh, et encore une chose... Cela n’arrive presque jamais, mais de temps en temps, quelque chose... d’inattendu peut mordre. Soyez prudent !${prompt}
  6975: Il n’y a rien de mieux que de pêcher depuis le bateau. Il y a tellement de choses uniques à attraper. Le temps passe vite !${prompt}
  6976: Il n’y a rien de mal avec les appâts, mais moi-même, je choisis des leurres. Vous pouvez continuer à les utiliser jusqu’à ce que votre ligne se brise ou que votre canne se casse. Bien sûr, ils coûtent plus cher.${prompt}
  6977: Dites, avez-vous entendu ? Les pirates parcourent les mers entre Selbina et Mhaura. Faites attention. On ne sait jamais quand ils frapperont la prochaine fois !${prompt}
  6978: Orcs au nord, tortues au sud... Avec l’océan désormais grouillant de corsaires, notre village est le seul refuge !${prompt}
  6979: Vous êtes déjà allé à Jeuno ? On dit que personne ne peut remettre en question la valeur d’un homme qui a marché jusqu’à Jeuno.${prompt}
  6980: Nous travaillons sur les quais. Les navires commerciaux ne pourraient pas naviguer sans nous, mais je suppose que nous mourrions de faim sans eux aussi.${prompt}
  6981: Gardez un œil attentif sur les pirates. On dit qu’ils frappent en utilisant des pouvoirs étranges. Ils disent que c’est la vérité, croyez-le ou non.${prompt}
  6982: J’entends beaucoup de Humes à Bastok nous mépriser, Galka.${prompt}
  6983: Personne n’est comme ça ici à Selbina. Ici, la race n’est pas un problème. Tout ce qui compte, c’est l’ouverture d’esprit.${prompt}
  6984: Notre ville est également éloignée de toutes les grandes nations. Vous pouvez aller à Bastok, vous pouvez aller à San d’Oria :toutes les routes sont tout aussi risquées.${prompt}
  6985: Mon mari est à la pêche. Beaucoup de bons poissons mordent ici.${prompt}
  6986: Nous jouons à cache-cache. Je me demande où sont les trois autres...${prompt}
  6987: Oh, vous m’avez trouvé en premier ! Je savais que ce serait une mauvaise cachette.${prompt}
  6988: Whoa, vous m’avez fait peur ! S'il vous plaît, ne leur dites pas que je suis là !${prompt}
  6989: Je me cacherais plus loin, mais il y a un homme effrayant là-bas. J’ai tellement peur qu’ils me trouvent ici !${prompt}
  6990: Ha ! Il ne me trouvera jamais ici ! Oh, attends... Il est vraiment doué pour nous trouver...${prompt}
  6991: C’est le manoir du maire. Notre maire est un homme bon. Entrez et dites bonjour.${prompt}
  6992: Les dunes de Valkurm sont le territoire de Selbina, mais notre milice est trop peu nombreuse pour y patrouiller. C’est triste, mais vous, les aventuriers, devez garder le sable en sécurité.${prompt}
  6993: Oh, encore vous. Merci pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour nous. Nous avons besoin de toute l’aide possible.${prompt}
  6994: Aucun problème signalé récemment. Pour nous, aucune nouvelle n’est une bonne nouvelle !${prompt}
  6995: Notre village est peut-être petit, mais tant de gens s’arrêtent ici pour se reposer sur la route entre Bastok et San d’Oria.${prompt}
  6996: Désolé, la station est réservée au personnel de la milice.${prompt}
  6997: Si vous sortez, n’oubliez pas que la sécurité réside dans le nombre. Rassemblez des personnes de différents talents pour couvrir les éventuelles faiblesses.${prompt}
  6998: Si vous êtes ici pour le navire, les quais se trouvent juste en bas des escaliers à partir d’ici.${prompt}
  6999: Je m’appelle Velema. Je surveille les quais.${prompt}
  7000: Y a-t-il un problème? Consultez le maire si vous avez des questions.${prompt}
  7001: Les visiteurs me demandent souvent comment trouver les mines de Palborough. Que pourraient-ils attendre de ses tunnels sombres et tortueux ?${prompt}
  7002: Avez-vous déjà visité la mairie ? Que Naillina en sait tellement sur tout !${prompt}
  7003: J’ai récemment remarqué qu’un homme à lvair terriblement suspect était en visite en ville. L’avez-vous vu ?${prompt}
  7004: Isacio était chevalier il y a longtemps. Je me demande ce qui l’a amené ici...${prompt}
  7005: Zaldon a toutes sortes d’histoires à raconter. Mais il est tellement têtu que vous en aurez mal à la tête !${prompt}
  7006: Gabwaleid en sait beaucoup sur la pêche. Il vous apprendra tout ce que vous devez savoir.${prompt}
  7007: Le cuisinier de l’auberge, Valgeir, concocte des plats fantastiques. J’aurais aimé avoir assez d’argent pour en essayer un !${prompt}
  7008: Le maire Abélard ressemble plus à un scientifique qu’à un homme politique. Il mène une sorte de recherche.${prompt}
  7009: Vuntar est un travailleur sérieux. À bien y penser, il travaille ici depuis aussi longtemps que je me souvienne...${prompt}
  7010: Melyon est tellement fier de ses moutons, n’est-ce pas ? Il leur a trouvé des noms intéressants.${prompt}
  7011: Roméo imagine toujours de nouvelles façons de gagner de l’argent. Et je pense qu’il est plutôt bon dans ce domaine aussi.${prompt}
  7012: Je m’appelle Manfried et je suis député avec Flandiace. Velema est notre sergent et nous servons tous les trois sous les ordres de Thunder Hawk.${prompt}
  7013: Bonjour !${prompt}

  7317: Ceux qui sont obsédés par la maîtrise de leurs compétences perdent souvent de vue la raison pour laquelle ils ont commencé à emprunter cette voie.${prompt}
  7318: Mitsunari voulait que vous le sachiez. C’est pourquoi son esprit est resté en mer.${prompt}

  7403: Elle voulait rencontrer quelqu’un qui vivait ici il y a longtemps.${prompt}

    Hein ? La jeune femme était déterminée à trouver son chemin vers l'archipel de Tavnazian ?
    Et vous pensez qu'elle est allée dans l'une des grottes des dunes de Valkurm ?${prompt}

  7423: Le nom est Diederik. Je travaille actuellement comme intermédiaire pour répondre aux besoins de mes clients.${prompt}
  7424: L’autre jour, un de mes clients, un vieil homme de Bastok, m’a dit qu’il voulait un tableau. J’ai donc passé commande auprès d’un peintre de Windurst.${prompt}
  7425: Elle s’appelait... Angelica, je pense que oui. Elle semble être plutôt connue des aventuriers.${prompt}
  7426: Quoi qu’il en soit, j’ai récupéré le tableau terminé et tout semblait bien se passer...${prompt}
  7427: Autrement dit, jusqu’à ce que mon navire soit attaqué par des pirates.${prompt}
  7428: Nous avons eu de la chance que personne à bord n’ait été blessé. Mais après, je n’ai trouvé le tableau nulle part.${prompt}
  7429: Mais je suis censé le livrer bientôt, et ça me fait transpirer rien que d’y penser !${prompt}
  7430: Non seulement ça, mais mon client est un vieil homme grincheux qui me coincera par les oreilles s’il n’obtient pas ce qu’il veut ! Je ne peux pas y faire face !${prompt}
  7431: Il ne va pas me laisser s’en sortir facilement après avoir perdu son précieux tableau.${prompt}
  7432: Même expliquer ce qui s’est passé ne servirait à rien avec une personne aussi aigre.${prompt}
  7433: C’est pourquoi je ne peux pas aller vers lui. Je ne sais pas ce que je dirais ! J’étais sur le point de retourner voir Angelica et de voir si elle allait refaire le tableau pour moi...${prompt}

  7437: Vous avez même été mannequin pour l’un de ses tableaux ? Excellent ! 
  7438: Je parie qu’elle vous écouterait si vous lui demandiez de refaire un tableau...${prompt}
  7439: Hé ! Je viens d’avoir une idée géniale ! Pourquoi n’irez-vous pas demander à Angelica de refaire le tableau ?${prompt}
  7440: Vous venez d’entendre pourquoi je ne pouvais pas y aller ! Vous êtes ma seule option !${prompt}
  7441: Vous êtes son amie, alors bien sûr, elle vous écoutera !${prompt}

  7468: Eh bien, en fait, je suis un peu dans le pétrin. J’apprécierais que vous m’écoutiez également.${prompt}

  7470: Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates et avez perdu le tableau ? Quelle malchance !${prompt}
  7471: Vous avez donc perdu le tableau au profit des pirates. Hm, ce n'est pas votre jour de chance.${prompt}
  7472: Je vois. Vous avez dû être déçu de perdre le tableau au profit des pirates.${prompt}
  7473: Des pirates ont attaqué votre navire et ont pris votre tableau ? Oh non!${prompt}

  7478: Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates ? Et vous avez perdu le tableau ? Je suis vraiment désolé !${prompt}
  7479: Je vois. Vous avez dû être déçu de perdre le tableau au profit des pirates.${prompt}

  7511: De cette façon, je n’aurai pas à lui dire que j’ai perdu le tableau...${prompt}

  7660: Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.${prompt}
  7661: To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.${prompt}
  7662: You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.${prompt}
  7663: We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.${prompt}
  7664: Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.${prompt}
  7665: The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.${prompt}
  7666: Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!${prompt}
  7667: Value is determined by the calculation of “points” and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the “smallest fish,” the person with the fewest points will win.${prompt}
  7668: During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!${prompt}
  7669: 'If you would like to submit an entry, please ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.${prompt}'
  7670: |-
    The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest.
    You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.${prompt}
  7671: After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.${prompt}
  7672: To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.${prompt}
  7673: This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.${prompt}
  7674: After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.${prompt}
  7675: Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!${prompt}
  7676: The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.${prompt}
  7677: 'In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as a souvenir.${prompt}'

  7986: Je suis Abelard, maire de ce village. Il est si petit, vous comprenez, que tout ce que je fais, c'est médier lorsqu'il y a des désaccords.${prompt}
  7987: Un associé entrepreneur, Gilgamesh, a prononcé votre nom ces derniers jours.${prompt}
  7988: Il a sauvé une jeune femme à la dérive en mer, et elle a parlé très favorablement de vous quand elle s'est réveillée.${prompt}
  7989: Vous retrouver a enlevé un fardeau de mes épaules, mais il en reste un autre.${prompt}
  7990: Vous voyez, Gilgamesh a fait une deuxième demande.${prompt}
  7991: 'Il recherche ${item-plural: 1[2]} qui peuvent être obtenus auprès de certaines grosses abeilles autour du Rocher de Holla ou du Rocher de Dem.${prompt}'
  7992: Leurs propriétés médicinales sont très appréciées même en temps de paix, et avec les récents événements étranges...${prompt}
  7993: Vous savez probablement ce que je vais vous demander.${prompt}
  7994: 'Récupérez trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} de ces menaces bourdonnantes situées autour de l’un des deux rochers mentionnés précédemment.${prompt}'
  7995: Bien sûr, vos efforts seront dûment récompensés.${prompt}
  7996: Bonne chance !${prompt}
  7997: Oh ! Vous les avez ramenés sains et saufs, alors ?${prompt}
  7998: Gilgamesh et son entourage viennent juste d'arriver au port.${prompt}
  7999: ${name-player}, heureux de te revoir !${prompt}
  8000: Donc, tu es ${name-player}, hein ? J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.${prompt}
  8001: 'Mon ami, ${name-player} a rassemblé ces ${item-plural: 1[2]}, comme vous l’avez demandé.${prompt}'
  8002: Ouais, c'est exactement ce qu'on a commandé. Maintenant, un peu de "donnant-donnant"...${prompt}
  8003: Excellent. Je pense que les aventuriers auront une utilité pour ces objets.${prompt}
  8004: Donc voici, ${name-player} - pour toi.${prompt}
  8005: On suppose qu'on ferait mieux d'aller droit au but.${prompt}
  8006: ${name-player}, tu es intimement familier avec mes voyages en tant que pirate sur la Mer de Bastore.${prompt}
  8007: ${name-player}, cela pourrait te surprendre un peu d'entendre cela, mais je suis un pirate connu pour errer sur la Mer de Bastore.${prompt}
  8008: Les océans à l'ouest ont été un peu plus agités que d'habitude ces derniers temps, et moi et mon équipage sommes tombés sur un petit navire à la dérive sur les marées.${prompt}
  8009: Alors, bien sûr, je me dis à moi-même, qui aurait pensé qu'une si délicate embarcation pourrait rester intacte dans une tempête aussi terrible... et puis tout le truc a commencé à clignoter en rouge.${prompt}
  8010: Étant le marin curieux que je suis, je suis allé investiguer. Et voilà qu'il y avait une jolie jeune fille allongée sur le pont.${prompt}
  8011: J'ai toujours eu un certain penchant pour la couleur rouge. Pensant que cela devait être un signe d'Altana elle-même, je l'ai embarquée et ramenée avec moi à Norg.${prompt}
  8012: Quand elle est revenue à elle, les premiers mots de ces lèvres pâles étaient votre nom.${prompt}
  8013: Alors je veux que tu reviennes à Norg avec nous. Elle était très insistante pour te rencontrer.${prompt}
  8014: Tu vois, elle a entamé un peu... une grève de la faim.${prompt}
  8015: Le navire est amarré au port en attendant de vous emmener dès que vous aurez terminé vos affaires ici.${prompt}
  8016: J'ai juste rappelé avoir une obligation un peu pressante à laquelle je dois assister, mais je te rattraperai là-bas.${prompt}
  8017: ...J'ai une requête. Ne respire pas un mot à la populace que j'ai aidé un pirate connu.${prompt}
  8018: Leurs activités ne sont pas totalement légales, mais en tant que ville portuaire, nous dépendons toujours d'eux.${prompt}
  8019: Et tant que nous parlons d'aide, n'oublie pas d'utiliser cet objet que je t'ai donné.${prompt}
  8020: Isacio ici en ville saura quoi en faire.${prompt}
  8021: Je suis sûr que cela vous aidera dans vos voyages.${prompt}
  8022: Nous mettons les voiles pour Norg, terre à terre ! J'espère que vous pourrez supporter les mers agitées.${prompt}
