  7238: Apportez-moi l'une de ces haches, et votre mission sera un succès. Pas de fuite maintenant ; nous avons un pays fier à défendre !${prompt}
  7239: Oh, vous êtes de retour. Eh bien, si vous êtes si heureux d'avoir vaincu un Orc ou deux, vous avez encore un long chemin à parcourir !${prompt}
  7240: 'C’est un autre ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour l’armurerie, alors. Mission accomplie ! Pas mal pour un nouveau recrue.${prompt}'
  7241: Quoi ? Je ne veux pas ça !${prompt}
  7242: Êtes-vous vraiment un nouveau recrue !?${prompt}
  7243: Écoutez, avant de me rapporter quelque chose, vous devez d'abord accepter la mission ! C'est ainsi que les choses fonctionnent ici !${prompt}
  7244: Persévérant, n'est-ce pas ? Un Orc sous la ceinture ne fait pas un héros ! Ah, j'ai juste le travail pour vous...${prompt}
  7245: Patrouille de chauves-souris ! Que dites-vous ? Ça ne devrait pas poser de problème pour un aventurier comme vous, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7246: Voici donc votre mission. Éliminez les chauves-souris qui rodent dans le Tombeau du Roi Ranperre et apportez-moi une dent comme preuve.${prompt}
  7247: 'Apportez-moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et votre mission sera un succès.${prompt}'
  7248: Au fond du tombeau, vous trouverez des Gobelins. Faites attention ; je ne veux pas vous perdre déjà.${prompt}
  7249: Ah, vous êtes revenu ! J'avais peur que les Gobelins vous aient attrapé.${prompt}
  7250: 'C’est un ${item-singular: 3[2]} pour la maison de garde, alors. Mission accomplie. Pas mal pour un nouveau recrue.${prompt}'
  7251: Ah, le recrue est de retour ? Désolé, mais je n'ai pas le temps pour vous aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  7252: Eh bien, peut-être pouvez-vous être utile. Beaucoup de nos enfants ont disparu mystérieusement, et je ne doute pas que les Orcs de Ghelsba en soient responsables.${prompt}
  7253: Les Chevaliers Royaux devraient être sur le coup à présent, mais les deux princes se disputent.${prompt}
  7254: Le prince Trion, l'aîné, dit que nous devrions lancer une attaque totale, au plus vite.${prompt}
  7255: Tandis que son frère cadet, le prince Pieuje, dit que la sécurité des enfants passe avant tout, et qu'il n'autorisera pas une attaque.${prompt}
  7256: Ils se disputent cela depuis des jours. Les mains des chevaliers sont liées, et franchement, personne ne sait quoi faire.${prompt}
  7257: Si vous voulez vraiment vous faire un nom, rendez-vous à Ghelsba et sauvez ces enfants kidnappés !${prompt}
  7258: Qu'en dites-vous ? Allez-vous y aller ?${prompt}
  7259: Voici donc votre mission. Sauvez les deux enfants kidnappés par les Orcs du poste avancé de Ghelsba.${prompt}
  7260: Le poste avancé de Ghelsba se trouve au nord-ouest de Ronfaure Ouest. Prenez le chemin avant la Porte de l'Ouest, puis tournez à droite lorsque le chemin se divise dans la forêt. Vous trouverez l'entrée en haut des collines.${prompt}
  7261: Si vous avez du mal à trouver le chemin, suivez simplement l'un des soldats en patrouille.${prompt}
  7262: Les Orcs ont tendance à garder leurs otages dans des tentes ou de petites huttes. Une fois à l'intérieur du camp, vérifiez-les en premier.${prompt}
  7263: Ah, vous êtes revenu ! Vous étiez parti si longtemps, j'ai craint qu'une machine de guerre ne vous ait attrapé !${prompt}
  7264: En tout cas, mission accomplie ! Et pour récompenser votre exploit...${prompt}
  7265: Je vous reconnais par la présente, ${name-player}, en tant qu'aventurier certifié de San d'Oria ! Vous êtes désormais rang deux des missions.${prompt}
  7266: Mais ne vous emballez pas trop. Votre titre n'est valide qu'ici à San d'Oria, vous comprenez ?${prompt}
  7267: 'Pour devenir un vrai aventurier et porter ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, vous devez également être reconnu par Bastok et Windurst.${prompt}'
  7268: '''C’est un traité entre les trois pays, et sa parole est loi. Je sais que c’est difficile, mais ce sont les règles.${prompt}'
  7269: Pour l’instant, faites vos premières armes d’aventurier dans les environs d’ici. Tôt ou tard, vous trouverez votre chemin vers d'autres terres.${prompt}
  7270: Vous atteignez le rang 2 !${prompt}
  7271: Il n'y a pas beaucoup de travail en ce moment. Je suppose que vous pourriez participer aux exercices de sauvetage des Chevaliers du Temple sur le plateau de La Théine.${prompt}
  7272: Entrez dans la forêt au-delà de la Porte de l'Ouest et dirigez-vous vers le sud-ouest. Vous arriverez bientôt sur le plateau de La Théine.${prompt}
  7273: Une fois sur le plateau, continuez jusqu'à ce que vous voyiez les chevaliers. Les terrains d'entraînement ne sont pas loin de là.${prompt}
  7274: Ce n'est qu'un exercice, donc cela devrait être facile par rapport à ce que vous avez l'habitude de faire. Suivez simplement les ordres et vous vous en sortirez.${prompt}
  7275: Vous êtes de retour ! J'ai entendu dire que l'exercice s'est transformé en quelque chose de beaucoup plus périlleux. Mais une vraie bataille est le meilleur exercice pour les recrues, à mon avis.${prompt}
  7276: Quoi qu'il en soit, vous avez bien fait. Je ferai appel à vous quand il y aura du travail à faire, maintenant.${prompt}
  7277: 'Tenez, prenez ce ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Allez-y, vous l’avez mérité.${prompt}'
  7278: Cette fois-ci, c'est une mission de messagerie. Un de nos chevaliers est en train de faire du repérage dans un endroit appelé Davoi, à la lisière sud de la forêt de Jugner.${prompt}
  7279: Le bastion des Orcs se trouve à Davoi, il est donc vital que nous les empêchions de se regrouper, sinon ils pourraient lancer une attaque.${prompt}
  7280: Bien sûr, les Orcs nous surveillent aussi. Il y a quelques jours à peine, une escouade de nos Chevaliers Royaux est tombée sous leurs haches.${prompt}
  7281: Nous avons envoyé des éclaireurs pour trouver une faille dans leurs défenses. Vous devez trouver le scout là-bas maintenant et ramener le dernier rapport d'éclaireur.${prompt}
  7282: Le nom du scout est Zantaviat. Il est quelque part à Davoi, mais où, je ne saurais dire.${prompt}
  7283: Revenez après avoir obtenu le rapport. Ces terres ne sont pas un endroit où errer.${prompt}
  7284: Vous êtes revenu ! Et vous avez apporté le rapport d'éclaireur. Bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7285: Des nouvelles préoccupantes, cela. Il dit que les Orcs se rassemblent au fond de l'encampement. Le moment d'agir approche !${prompt}
  7286: Mais ce n'est pas votre préoccupation. Vous avez bien travaillé aujourd'hui. Mission accomplie !${prompt}
  7287: Oh, c'est vous, ${name-player}. Et juste au bon moment. Monarlais Halver recherche un aventurier comme vous.${prompt}
  7288: Entrez au Château d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver s'y trouve ; il vous expliquera en personne.${prompt}
  7289: Quoi ? Vous n'avez pas encore été certifié à Bastok et Windurst ? Vous pouvez traîner, mais d'autres ne le peuvent pas ! Bougez-vous !${prompt}
  7290: Ah, bienvenue de retour. Je vois que vous avez été certifié à Bastok et Windurst. Bon travail. Vous ferez un excellent aventurier.${prompt}
  7291: Qu'est-ce que c'est, un rapport pour notre royaume ? Je vois. Apportez cela au monarlais lorsque vous irez.${prompt}
  7292: 'Vous devriez recevoir ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} de Monarlais Halver. Maintenant, allez au Château d’Oraguille et faites-leur savoir que vous êtes de retour !${prompt}'
  7293: Dépêchez-vous au Château d'Oraguille et remettez ce rapport à Monarlais Halver !${prompt}
  7294: Vous atteignez le rang 3 !${prompt}
  7295: Ah ! Vous arrivez juste au bon moment. Zantaviat, l'un de nos éclaireurs à Davoi, a besoin d'un aventurier.${prompt}
  7296: Il veut quelqu'un pour infiltrer Davoi et faire du repérage derrière les lignes ennemies. Connaissez-vous quelqu'un correspondant à cette description ?${prompt}
  7297: 'Maintenant que vous avez votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, c’est une opportunité de prouver que vous en valez la peine !${prompt}'
  7298: La situation à Davoi s'aggrave de jour en jour. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais je ne peux pas penser à un meilleur aventurier pour le travail !${prompt}
  7299: Vous êtes revenu ! Zantaviat m'a tout raconté. Félicitations pour un travail bien fait !${prompt}
  7300: Mais nous ne pouvons pas baisser la garde pour autant. Ces Orcs ne resteront pas là sans rien faire. Nous devons rester vigilants en permanence et agir avant eux !${prompt}
  7301: 'Voici votre récompense : ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Vous devenez vraiment un aventurier accompli, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}'
  7302: Bienvenue de retour ! J'ai une mission importante pour vous cette fois. Récemment, les terres s'érodent en raison de la formation de cristaux... et ça empire.${prompt}
  7303: Il y a une petite source à l'est de la forêt de Jugner, appelée Source de Cristal. Nous devons savoir quel effet la formation de cristaux a sur la faune là-bas.${prompt}
  7304: 'Je veux que vous me rapportiez un poisson de la source. Et pas n’importe quel poisson ! Vous avez besoin de prendre ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7305: Ah, ça me rappelle - avez-vous du matériel de pêche ? Vous en aurez besoin pour cette mission.${prompt}
  7306: Il y a des gens dans le coin qui s'y connaissent en pêche, si vous avez besoin d'aide pour trouver et choisir votre équipement.${prompt}
  7307: Ah, le grand pêcheur est de retour ! J'étais inquiet, pour être honnête. Tout ce que vous entendez ces jours-ci, c'est le regroupement des bêtes, l'érosion des Lignes de Cristal, et maintenant...${prompt}
  7308: '...des rumeurs disant que le Seigneur des Ombres lui-même est de retour !${prompt}'
  7309: Nous examinerons le poisson que vous avez apporté. Selon les résultats, nous pourrions devoir agir ! Je vous ferai savoir si nous avons besoin de votre aide.${prompt}
  7310: Ah, c'est vous, ${name-player}. Vous arrivez au bon moment. J'ai des nouvelles pour vous.${prompt}
  7311: Par ordre du Royaume de San d'Oria, vous devez vous rendre à Jeuno en tant qu'attaché ambassadeur.${prompt}
  7312: Rendez-vous au Château d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver vous dira tout ce que vous devez savoir.${prompt}

  7321: Te voilà ! Je te cherchais. Monarlais Halver demande ta présence au château immédiatement.${prompt}
  7322: Il semble que ce soit une mission assez importante. Je n'ai pas besoin de te rappeler que tu devrais prendre soin de t'équiper correctement avant de partir pour ce voyage.${prompt}
  7323: Je ne suis pas sûr de ce dont il s'agit, mais tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher. Le monarlais n'aime pas attendre !${prompt}
  7324: Tiens, si ce n'est pas ${name-player} ! Ce n'est pas le moment de traîner, mon ami ! Le prince Trion te cherche.${prompt}
  7325: Pour cette prochaine mission, il t'a demandé personnellement. Tu devrais être honoré !${prompt}
  7326: Quant aux détails de la mission, je n'en ai aucune idée, mais il était pressé. Tu ferais mieux de te rendre au Château d'Oraguille !${prompt}
  7327: C'est une grande chose que tu as accomplie, ${name-player} ! Je savais au fond de mon cœur que tu étais la personne pour la tâche.${prompt}
  7328: Tu ferais mieux de te rendre rapidement au château. Ils sont tous impatients de te souhaiter la bienvenue, je parie.${prompt}
  7329: Tu as sauvé notre fier Royaume de San d'Oria. Non, tu es le sauveur de tout Vana'diel ! Il n'y a pas une seule personne qui ne te doit pas une grande dette, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7330: |-
    Ah, si ce n'est pas ${name-player} !
    Tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher d'aller au Château d'Oraguille. Il semble qu'il se passe quelque chose de terrible là-bas.${prompt}
  7331: |-
    Eh bien, si ce n'est pas ${name-player} !
    Ton timing est parfait. Le château vient de faire une demande pour un aventurier.${prompt}
  7332: Il semble que cette prochaine mission ait quelque chose à voir avec feu la reine. Tu devrais te sentir honoré. Ce n'est pas tous les jours qu'un aventurier a l'occasion de travailler directement avec la famille royale.${prompt}
  7333: |-
    Parle comme un vrai San d'Orien !
    Maintenant, dépêche-toi d'aller au Château d'Oraguille et obtiens les détails sur la mission auprès de Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  7334: Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? Traiter avec la royauté n'est pas ta tasse de thé ? Eh bien, réfléchis-y et reviens quand tu auras retrouvé tes esprits.${prompt}
  7335: Le prince Trion demande l'aide d'un aventurier. Qu'en penses-tu ?${prompt}
  7336: Il semble assez urgent, donc tu devrais te dépêcher d'aller au château. Le prince t'attend dans ses appartements.${prompt}
  7337: Je m'attendais à mieux de ta part, ${name-player}. Si tu changes d'avis, reviens ici. Je t'attendrai.${prompt}
  7338: J'ai reçu les détails de ta mission du prince Trion. Je remettrai ce livre aux érudits pour le déchiffrer.${prompt}
  7339: 'Le déchiffrement du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} prendra un certain temps. Reviens plus tard pour un rapport.${prompt}'
  7340: 'Tu as remis le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au garde.${prompt}'
  7341: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Nous t'attendions.
    Le prince Trion te demande. Je me demande si cela signifie que le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} a été complètement déchiffré.${prompt}
  7342: Bien joué, ${name-player} ! Je savais que tu ne décevrais pas le Royaume.${prompt}
  7343: Je suis fier d'augmenter ton rang à 7 !${prompt}
  7344: Le papsque a du travail pour toi, ${name-player}. Es-tu prêt à relever le défi ?${prompt}
  7345: Excellent. Rends-toi dans les chambres du papsque au troisième étage de la cathédrale.${prompt}
  7346: Le papsque peut sembler être un homme difficile, mais en réalité, il est très bon et compatissant. Si tu changes d'avis, je t'attendrai ici.${prompt}
  7347: La belle Claidie I d'Oraguille t'a invité au château. Elle souhaite que tu voies les fleurs qui ont fleuri à partir des graines que tu as ramenées d'Altepa.${prompt}
  7348: C'est un honneur d'être invité dans le jardin du château. Un jour, tu pourrais même avoir l'occasion d'assister à l'une de leurs fêtes de jardin royales.${prompt}
  7349: Nous ne pouvons pas faire attendre la princesse. Maintenant, en route pour le château !${prompt}
  7350: Une patrouille de Chevaliers Royaux stationnée à Ghelsba Outpost a signalé une activité étrange des Orcs au fond de Yughott Grotto.${prompt}
  7351: D'après vos rapports, nous savons déjà que les bêtes ont construit un portail géant, mais leurs motivations restent floues.${prompt}
  7352: Cela me donne des frissons de penser à ce que ces Orcs préparent avec ce portail...${prompt}
  7353: ${name-player}, ta prochaine mission est de te rendre à Ghelsba et de poursuivre ton enquête sur les activités des Orcs.${prompt}
  7354: Sois sur tes gardes lorsque tu t'aventures profondément dans Yughott Grotto. Perdre un aventurier tel que toi serait un grand coup pour tout San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7355: Je vois que tu as besoin de plus de temps pour te préparer. Quand tu seras prêt, je t'attendrai.${prompt}
  7356: C'est difficile à croire que les Orcs ont entre leurs mains un équipement aussi dangereux. Nous devrons envoyer davantage de patrouilles pour prévenir tout nouveau développement dans leurs plans maléfiques.${prompt}
  7357: 'Et ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... Nous devrons l’analyser et commencer la reproduction pour nos forces. Nous ne pouvons pas laisser les Orcs mettre la Main du Dragon avant que San d’Oria ne le fasse.${prompt}'
  7358: Félicitations pour l'achèvement de ta mission. Hein ? Connais-je un aventurier nommé Eideialc ? Je n'en ai jamais entendu parler.${prompt}
  7359: Mais tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter d'un simple voyageur. Tu es dans une toute autre catégorie. Tu es maintenant rang 8 !${prompt}
  7360: La cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte de la princesse Claidie approche. Cette cérémonie est un élément important de la tradition d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  7361: Monarlais Halver a lancé un appel aux aventuriers de haut rang pour leur assistance au Château d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  7362: Ah, la jeune princesse est enfin devenue une dame... Oh, je suis désolé. Tu peux obtenir les détails de ta prochaine mission auprès de Sir Halver.${prompt}
  7363: Quoi ? Tu ne souhaites pas rendre la pareille à la gentillesse que la princesse t'a montrée ces derniers mois ? Comme tu voudras... mais si tu changes d'avis, tu sais où me trouver.${prompt}
  7364: Je suis occupé avec les préparatifs de la cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte de la princesse Claidie. Tu ne sais pas quel genre de vermine pourrait errer dans les rues et chercher des ennuis.${prompt}
  7365: La cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte de la princesse Claidie est sur le point de commencer à la cathédrale. Je dois rester à mon poste, mais pourquoi ne pas y assister ?${prompt}
  7366: Le roi demande votre audience. Il vous a choisi parmi la montagne d'aventuriers de San d'Oria. Vous devriez vous sentir honoré !${prompt}
  7367: Vous avez mûri d'un aventurier débutant en un grand atout pour notre royaume. Ne nous décevez pas.${prompt}
  7368: Il n'y a pas besoin de modestie en ce moment. Le destin de San d'Oria est en jeu !${prompt}
  7369: Les autorités affirment qu'un sombre nuage de désespoir plane sur le Royaume. Elles demandent l'assistance uniquement des meilleurs aventuriers.${prompt}
  7370: Je ne peux penser à personne de plus qualifié que vous. Accepterez-vous cette mission ?${prompt}
  7371: |-
    Alors rendez-vous dans la Salle d'Audience du Château d'Oraguille.
    On dit que Son Altesse ne se sent pas très bien. Il pourrait ne pas être présent pour votre briefing.${prompt}
  7372: ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame] ${name-player} ! Le Royaume compte sur vous. Qui d'autre, je vous le demande, est digne de cette tâche ?${prompt}
  7373: Ah, une période de grands changements s'annonce. Dans quelques jours seulement, les Rites de Succession auront lieu à la cathédrale du Nord de San d'Oria. C'est alors que le nouvel héritier au trône sera décidé.${prompt}
  7374: En raison des circonstances imprévisibles survenues lors de la cérémonie de passage à l'âge adulte de la princesse, cette fois, seuls le personnel autorisé seront autorisés à s'approcher des procédures. Cependant, la famille royale a demandé vos services en tant que garde.${prompt}
  7375: Même nous, Chevaliers Royaux, n'avons pas été autorisés à y assister... Vous devez être très estimé par Son Altesse. Je vous envie, ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame].${prompt}
  7376: Lorsque vous aurez terminé vos préparatifs, rendez-vous directement à la cathédrale pour faire votre rapport.${prompt}
  7377: Officieusement, lequel des deux princes pensez-vous devrait être le prochain héritier du trône ?${prompt}
  7378: |-
    C'est une décision difficile, mais...
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion est mieux adapté.
    Pieuje est mieux adapté.${prompt}
  7379: |-
    Hm...
    Étant l'aîné, il est le véritable héritier, et beaucoup de gens pensent qu'il est le plus adapté pour diriger le Royaume. Cependant, les voies prudentes du Prince Pieuje pourraient être ce qui manque à ce pays.${prompt}
  7380: Beaucoup pensent comme vous, ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame] ${name-player}. Cependant, ce dont ce pays pourrait avoir besoin, c'est de quelqu'un qui ne reculera pas face à une menace, quelqu'un qui défendra la fierté du Royaume.${prompt}
  7381: Mais notre opinion n'a pas d'importance. Lumineux décidera qui est le mieux adapté pour diriger notre magnifique nation. Et ne parlez pas un mot de notre échange d'aujourd'hui, car le monarlais aura nos têtes s'il découvre.${prompt}
  7382: Je réalise que vous devez avoir de nombreuses préparations avant de prendre une mission aussi importante. Prenez votre temps et revenez ici quand vous serez prêt.${prompt}
  7383: 'DÉBOGAGE : U_MS_START= "${number: 0}"${prompt}'

    Quelle est la vraie nature de cet autre monde ? Je ne peux l'expliquer que comme un endroit qui se situe au-delà des limites de notre connaissance.
    Mais je suis sûr d'avoir déjà ressenti cette aura quelque part...${prompt}
  7511: C'est ça. Ce protocrystal que j'ai trouvé en faisant des recherches à Elshimo. Les émanations magiques venant du cristal m'ont donné une impression similaire. Un avatar ? Non, ça ne peut pas être...${prompt}

    C'était une erreur de te protéger...

  7540: |-
    D'une chose j'étais certain.
    Cette voix appartenait au souverain de Dynamis.${prompt}
  7541: Il existe un flux d'énergie dans Vana'diel qui a échappé à l'attention de ceux qui y habitent.${prompt}
  7542: |-

    Cette tâche est trop lourde pour être portée par un seul individu.

    C'est la réunion de trente ans de notre expédition.${prompt}

    Ce n'est pas les Terres du Nord cette fois.
    Aucun de nous ne va vieillir et mourir, alors avec qui d'autre voudriez-vous être pour une tâche aussi longue que celle-ci ?${prompt}
  7554: |-
    Je ne vais pas reculer, peu importe à quel point tu te plains.
    Il vaut mieux juste accepter le fait que tu es coincé avec moi.${prompt}

    Je pensais que c'était la fin pour toi, c'est sûr...
    Hmph. Tu es aussi endurci que tu l'étais autrefois.${prompt}
  7556: |-
    Quoi, pas un mot pour un vieil ami ?
    Tu penses à tester ta théorie sur la possibilité de tuer une âme ?${prompt}

    Je t'ai trahi !
    J'ai éteint la lumière de ta précieuse Cornelia !
    L'homme responsable de ce cauchemar est juste devant toi !${prompt}
  7558: |-
    Tout a commencé il y a trente ans.
    Et il y avait des choses qui ont pris fin...
    Même si j'étais prisonnier d'une rage incontrôlable, le fait demeure que j'ai ôté la vie à mes compagnons de mes propres mains.${prompt}
  7559: Et pourtant, mes anciens compagnons, c'est vous qui m'avez sauvé de tomber dans ce gouffre de haine une deuxième fois.${prompt}
  7560: |-
    J'ai des mots de gratitude, mais je ne me trouve pas en position de blâmer quiconque pour ses actions.
    Peu importe qui cette personne peut être.${prompt}
  7561: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  7562: |-
    Es-tu sûr de vouloir faire cela ?
    Ce devoir continuera jusqu'à ce que la haine se soit dissipée de la terre.
    Tant que mon âme divisée subsistera, il pourrait ne jamais y avoir de fin à cette rage...${prompt}
  7563: |-
    Raogrimm.
    Il n'est plus nécessaire de souffrir seul.
    Notre présence ici devrait répondre à ta question.${prompt}
  7564: |-
    Il y a des crimes qui doivent être expiés.
    Et si cela signifie rester après la mort et veiller sur ce monde, alors nous, qui étions tes compagnons, partagerons le fardeau avec toi.${prompt}
  7565: |-
    Jusqu'à l'aube d'une ère sans haine...

  7856: Salutations, et bienvenue chez Épicerie Raimbroy. Si vous souhaitez effectuer un achat, parlez à quelqu'un au comptoir à l'étage.${prompt}
  7857: Salut !${prompt}
  7858: Ah, Katharina ! Comment se passe les choses aux Lion Springs ?${prompt}
  7859: Peut-être est-ce le temps, mais nous vendons tellement de mulsum si rapidement, nous n'arrivons pas à suivre ! Nous avons besoin d'un autre tonneau dès que possible !${prompt}
  7860: Un tonneau de mulsum, hein ? D'accord, laissez-moi aller vérifier.${prompt}
  7861: Cher, cher... Il semble que celui que je vous ai donné hier était le dernier de mon stock ! Je suis à sec, en effet.${prompt}
  7862: Oh... Eh bien, je dois y retourner maintenant, mais pourriez-vous en apporter un autre très vite ? Merci !${prompt}
  7863: Eh bien, c'est dommage. Je vais juste devoir trouver un autre aventurier, plus disposé.${prompt}
  7864: Un tonneau de mulsum... Je suis à court de miel, et mon garçon de course est à la maison en train de se remettre de blessures qu'il a subies à Ghelsba.${prompt}
  7865: Hrmm... Hein ? Un aventurier ! Pensez-vous pouvoir m'apporter du miel ? Je suis à court d'aide, vous voyez.${prompt}
  7866: 'Eh bien, merci à vous ! J’aurai besoin de cinq ${item-plural: 0[2]}, si vous pensez pouvoir gérer ça.${prompt}'
  7867: Exactement ce dont j'avais besoin ! Voici votre paiement, alors.${prompt}
  7868: Hrmm... Toujours pas assez, hein ? Désolé de vous faire courir comme ça, mais pensez-vous pouvoir m'en apporter davantage ?${prompt}${prompt}
  7869: 'J’accepterai cinq ${item-plural: 0[2]} et pas moins, à chaque fois que vous pourrez les apporter. Bonne chance !${prompt}'
  7870: 'Ah, donc vous allez chasser des ${item-plural: 0[2]} pour moi, alors ?${prompt}'
  7871: Heh-heh ! Vous voulez savoir quelque chose de vraiment génial ? Le miel de ces abeilles sur le plateau de La Theine est le meilleur !${prompt}
  7872: On m'appelle le roi du miel de San d'Oria, donc vous savez que je ne peux pas me tromper ! Oui, c'est l'un des meilleurs qui soit ! Un goût et vous en voudrez plus !${prompt}
  7873: Mais attention aux abeilles. Elles ont des dards empoisonnés et elles ont tendance à essaimer, alors soyez prudent !${prompt}
  7874: 'Quoi ? Toujours pas de ${item-plural: 0[2]} ? Si j’avais juste cinq, je pourrais commencer...${prompt}'
  7875: 'Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Je pensais vous avoir demandé d’apporter cinq ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Alors mettez-vous au travail !${prompt}'
  7876: Merci encore pour votre aide.${prompt}
  7877: Prenez une épée, mon ami. Je parlerai avec vous quand vous l'aurez fait, et pas avant.${prompt}
  7878: Ami, écoutez-moi. Ce ne sont ni les rouages ni les leviers ni même les plus puissants des sorts qui protègent ce royaume de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7879: Non! Nous, les Elvaan, vivons uniquement par la puissance de l'épée. Nos lames défendent nos frontières.${prompt}
  7880: Si vous voulez renforcer votre bras d'épée et apprendre quelque chose de l'art, alors acceptez mon défi. Qu'en dites-vous?${prompt}
  7881: |-
    Accepter son défi ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Accepter.
    Refuser.${prompt}
  7882: Comme vous voulez. Revenez quand vous aurez un peu de courage.${prompt}
  7883: Ah, je vois que tu as un cœur vaillant. Écoute bien maintenant !${prompt}
  7884: 'Rends-toi au Tombeau du Roi Ranperre et rapporte ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Comment, tu demandes ? Utilise ta tête. Maintenant, va-t''en !${prompt}'
  7885: Ah, j'avais raison à ton sujet. Tu as prouvé ta valeur aujourd'hui. Un renforcement supplémentaire pourrait te forger en héros parmi les aventuriers.${prompt}
  7886: En reconnaissance de ton succès, je t'offre cette épée. Entraîne-toi assidûment et deviens fort.${prompt}
  7887: Tu es encore un peu novice pour entreprendre mon défi. Entraîne-toi davantage et reviens ici quand tu te sentiras prêt.${prompt}
  7888: Cette chose que tu m'as donnée, elle n'a aucun rapport avec ta tâche ; je ne peux pas l'accepter.${prompt}
  7889: Et qui es-tu, je te prie ? Je ne peux pas prendre ce que je n'ai pas demandé. Prends-le et va-t-en.${prompt}
  7890: Tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Tu as sûrement entendu parler du Tombeau du Roi Ranperre.${prompt}
  7891: |-
    Entendu parler du tombeau ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7892: Le Tombeau du Roi Ranperre se trouve sous une pente bien au sud de Porte Est.${prompt}
  7893: Le tombeau est le lieu de repos final du Roi Dragon de San d'Oria. Il a été construit dans une grotte pour le protéger des voleurs.${prompt}
  7894: Bien que le tombeau soit à l'abri des pillards, les grottes abritent toutes sortes de créatures diaboliques.${prompt}
  7895: Vraiment ? Eh bien alors...${prompt}
  7896: Je suis chargé de veiller sur le tombeau. Il n'y a pas si longtemps, je nettoyais ses pierres et changeais l'offrande tous les jours.${prompt}
  7897: Mais maintenant que les démons ont envahi les lieux, mon travail nécessiterait de risquer ma vie. Aucun travail ne vaut ça !${prompt}
  7898: J’ai décidé de ne pas y retourner, mais le Roi Dragon lui-même est venu à moi dans mes rêves et a dit, "J’ai soif... Apporte-moi de l’eau."${prompt}
  7899: J’aimerais l'aider, au moins en lui apportant de l’eau fraîche...${prompt}
  7900: J’ai une demande. Pourrais-tu te rendre au tombeau et y remplacer l’offrande par de l’eau fraîche ?${prompt}
  7901: C’est... malheureux.${prompt}
  7902: 'Alors, tu vas aider ? Excellent ! Prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} au Tombeau du Roi Ranperre et échange-le avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} que tu trouveras là-bas.${prompt}'
  7903: Pour te rendre au Tombeau du Roi Ranperre, dirige-toi vers la Porte Est dans la Ronfaure de l'Est, puis avance vers le sud aussi loin que possible. Tu devrais le trouver assez rapidement.${prompt}
  7904: 'Tu as perdu le ${item-singular: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7905: 'Plus de ${item-singular: 0[2]} est facilement disponible, mais la question est comment le transporter...${prompt}'
  7906: Je n'ai pas d'autre outre d'eau à te donner. Celle-ci je l'ai reçue de feu la reine elle-même...${prompt}
  7907: Et si tu prenais l’outre d’eau de la pierre tombale dans le Tombeau du Roi Ranperre, que tu la remplissais à San d’Oria sud, puis que tu la rapportais au tombeau ?${prompt}
  7908: Considère cela comme une pénitence pour avoir perdu l’outre d'eau que je t’ai donnée. D’accord ? Je te souhaite un bon voyage.${prompt}'
  7909: 'Remplis l’outre d’eau avec ${item-singular: 0[2]}, place-la dans la tombe du Roi Dragon, puis reviens vers moi.${prompt}'
  7910: Prends l’outre d'eau de la pierre tombale dans le Tombeau du Roi Ranperre, remplis-la à San d’Oria sud, puis rapporte-la au tombeau.${prompt}'
  7911: Tu trouves un puits.${prompt}
  7912: 'Tu remplis l’${item-singular: 1[2]} avec ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7913: Tu n’as plus besoin d’eau.${prompt}
  7914: Je ne me souviens pas t'avoir demandé ça.${prompt}
  7915: Je te remercie, brave aventurier. Sa Majesté, le dernier roi, te remercie également.${prompt}
  7916: Ce n’est pas grand-chose, mais s’il te plaît, accepte ceci en retour.${prompt}
  7917: 'Hein ? Qu’est-il arrivé à l’${item-singular: 0[2]} ? S’il te plaît, tu dois me le ramener !${prompt}'
  7918: 'As-tu apporté l’${item-singular: 0[2]} ? Si oui, donne-le-moi, s’il te plaît. ${prompt}'
  7919: Eh bien, tu as perdu l’outre d'eau, mais voyager jusqu’au tombeau du défunt roi et revenir n’est pas une mince affaire. Je te félicite.${prompt}
  7920: J’avais pensé déduire le coût de l’outre d’eau de ta compensation, mais je ne peux pas ignorer les efforts que tu as endurés pour moi. Tu mérites ta pleine récompense.${prompt}
  7921: À la recherche de travail ? Eh bien, perrrhaps tu pourrais me rassembler plus de peaux cette fois-ci ?${prompt}
  7922: En tant qu’aventurier, tu devrais apprécier la satisfaction que tu ressens en affinant tes compétences jour après jour.${prompt}
  7923: J’ai reçu trop de peaux de mouton dernièrement, alors perrrhaps tu pourrais me ramener quelque chose d’autre cette fois-ci.${prompt}
  7924: 'Je pourrais te fabriquer une belle pièce de cuir, si tu pouvais me fournir trois ${item-plural: 0[2]} des Dunes de Valkurm.${prompt}'
  7925: 'Apporte-moi trois autres ${item-plural: 0[2]}, et je serai heureux de t’en fabriquer un autre !${prompt}'
  7926: 'Que malheureux. Tu devrais savoir que les marchandises faites à partir de ${item-singular: 0[2]} se vendent à un bon prix.${prompt}'
  7927: Excellent ! Je sais que tu seras satisfait du résultat. Fais attention à ces dents de lézard !${prompt}
  7928: 'Eh bien, qu’en est-il des ${item-plural: 0[2]} ? J’ai besoin de trrrois d’entre eux pour fabriquer quoi que ce soit.${prompt}'
  7929: Je prendrai toujours des peaux de mouton aussi, alors reviens une fois que tu en auras trrrois.${prompt}
  7930: Tu les as apportées ? Joie ! Tu apportes toujours les meilleures peaux, tu sais. Tu devrais travailler pour moi à plein temps !${prompt}
  7931: Je plaisantais. Je suis sûr que tu as plein de choses à faire. Attends juste ici, et je vais m’y mettre.${prompt}
  7932: C'est fini ! Vrrraiment, une bonne peau fait toute la différence, je pense que tu seras d'accord.${prompt}
  7933: Reviens quand tu veux !${prompt}
  7934: 'Je n’accepte plus de ${item-plural: 0[2]}, mais je prends toujours toutes les ${item-plural: 1[2]} et ${item-plural: 2[2]} que je peux obtenir, alors amène-moi-en plus ! Par lots de trois, s’il te plaît.${prompt}'
  7935: Ah, tu as parcouru un long chemin depuis notre dernière rencontre, je le vois. Je crois que tu es prêt pour une autre tâche !${prompt}
  7936: J’aimerais que tu ailles aux Grottes d'Ordelle. Tu trouveras l’entrée dans une vallée sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  7937: Ces grottes sont également appelées les "Grottes du Corps". Sais-tu pourquoi ?${prompt}
  7938: C'est parce que les grottes ont une forme très semblable à celle d'une personne. Tu es familier avec leur structure, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7939: Là où dans un corps se trouve le ventre, dans les grottes coule une cascade d'une grande beauté. Je veux que tu visites la cascade et que tu reviennes ici.${prompt}
  7940: Je veux une preuve de ton voyage, cependant. Apporte-moi quelque chose de cet endroit. Tu dois choisir quelque chose.${prompt}
  7941: Maintenant que j'y pense, la dernière fois que j'ai envoyé quelqu'un à la cascade, il a lui aussi eu beaucoup de difficultés ! Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7942: Une preuve que tu es allé à la cascade, hein ? Hah ! Le vieux Balasiel t'a envoyé faire des commissions maintenant, hein ?${prompt}
  7943: Je vais te le dire, mais ne dis pas un mot au vieux ! Tiens-toi dos à la cascade et regarde le plafond de la grotte. Tu verras une stalactite brillante.${prompt}
  7944: 'Rapporte ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} et tu seras un vrai spéléologue, tu verras.${prompt}'
  7945: Hein ? Comment l'obtenir ? Ah... d'accord. C'est bizarre, mais je ne semble pas me souvenir comment j'ai fait. C'était il y a longtemps, tu vois.${prompt}
  7946: Hmm... Peut-être pourrais-tu essayer de te renseigner là-dessus. Je suis sûr que c'est expliqué quelque part.${prompt}
  7947: Ah, tu es de retour, et en un seul morceau ! Et tu as apporté la preuve de ton voyage à la cascade. Bien joué !${prompt}
  7948: Tiens, un certificat pour marquer ta réussite. Garde-le toujours !${prompt}
  7949: Quand tu auras progressé davantage, reviens me voir. La prochaine fois, un test approfondi de ta valeur sera de mise !${prompt}
  7950: Tu vois un journal.${prompt}
  7951: |-
    Lire le journal ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Lis-le.

    Finalement, je vais passer.
    Page 1.
    Page 2.
    Page 3.${prompt}
  7953: Je suis allé à la grotte de Yughott hier. J'ai aidé un aventurier là-bas qui prétendait être en mission pour le Royaume.${prompt}
  7954: Pourquoi les démons augmentent-ils si évidemment en nombre ?${prompt}
  7955: J'ai visité de nombreux endroits, essayant de découvrir les plans des hommes-bêtes, mais je n'ai jamais rencontré une telle créature.${prompt}
  7956: Je l'ai vu là à l'entrée de la grotte. Heureusement, il n'a pas remarqué ma présence.${prompt}
  7957: Il était le même qu'il a toujours été - à la fois les bonnes parties et les mauvaises.${prompt}
  7958: 'Cela me rappelle, j’ai revu la cascade. Je me souviens quand j’étais écuyer en formation, allant chercher ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, il y a si longtemps.${prompt}'
  7959: Un voyageur m’a dit l'autre jour qu'un certain type de mousse peut aider à soulager les toux sévères.${prompt}
  7960: Peut-être que j’en ramasserai lors de ma prochaine patrouille, pour le donner à cet enfant et à sa mère. Je ne sais pas combien je pourrai en porter, cependant.${prompt}
  7961: Si seulement il y avait quelqu'un qui pourrait le livrer à ma place...${prompt}
  7962: Bonjour, jeune ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] ! Comment puis-je vous aider aujourd'hui ?${prompt}
  7963: |-
    Comment puis-je aider ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Parle-moi de la mousse.
    Parle-moi des baumes pour le rhume.${prompt}
  7964: Eh ? Du lichen pour soigner les toux ?${prompt}
  7965: 'Eh bien, ça ressemble à ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Une infusion de ce lichen amer soulage les toux les plus persistantes. Je l’ai moi-même utilisé !${prompt}'
  7966: 'Si vous avez besoin de quelque chose pour les toux, apportez-moi ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, et je vous ferai une infusion gratuitement.${prompt}'
  7967: 'Où pousse ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, me demandez-vous ? Eh bien, ma mère me disait qu’il poussait près d’une abbaye, mais je ne me rappelle pas où cela se trouvait.${prompt}'
  7968: Que faire ? J'essayais de monter sur cette planche au-dessus de la barricade et j’ai glissé et je suis tombé ! C’est un danger public, tout mouillé et couvert de mousse.${prompt}
  7969: Il fait sombre et humide là-dessous.${prompt}
  7970: Il y a beaucoup de mousse qui pousse ici.${prompt}
  7971: Cet endroit, c’est comme un labyrinthe ! Cela dit, je me suis déjà perdu dans mon propre jardin une fois...${prompt}
  7972: 'Oooh ! C’est ça ! C’est la mousse ! Je vais faire une belle ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec ça. Attendez un moment, ma chère.${prompt}'

  7974: 'Voilà, la ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est à vous. Puissiez-vous en faire bon usage.${prompt}'
  7975: L’infusion que je vous ai donnée, a-t-elle fonctionné ? Revenez me voir si vous avez besoin d’aide, ma chère.${prompt}
  7976: 'C’est... <tousse>... C’est ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ! Mais je ne peux pas accepter quelque chose d’aussi précieux sans...sans payer !${prompt}'
  7977: Mais je n’ai que peu d’argent. Tenez, c’était à mon défunt mari. Peut-être que cela vous sera utile.${prompt}
  7978: Merci pour votre aide. Ma condition s’est beaucoup améliorée, grâce à vous !${prompt}
  7979: Un aventurier, hein ? La commerçante ici recherche quelqu'un comme vous. Elle est juste en haut de ces escaliers.${prompt}
  7980: Cher, cher moi. Si seulement un aventurier pouvait m’aider...${prompt}
  7981: 'J’ai reçu une commande de talismans votifs de la cathédrale. Mais je n’ai pas ${item-plural: 0[2]} pour les fabriquer!${prompt}'
  7982: Seriez-vous assez aimable pour aller dans la forêt de Jugner et collecter trois crocs de tigres des forêts là-bas ?${prompt}
  7983: Chaque trois crocs que vous m'apporterez, je pourrai remplir une commande. Cela signifierait beaucoup pour moi !${prompt}
  7984: Alors vous y allez ? Je vous en remercie. Rappelez-vous, la forêt de Jugner est remplie de tigres des forêts. Ils peuvent être un peu agressifs, alors marchez prudemment !${prompt}

  7994: Bienvenue, bienvenue ! L'un de mes assistants sera heureux de vous aider !${prompt}
  7995: Ah, ça me rappelle. Il y avait un message de Brugaire, pour savoir si les armes qu'ils avaient commandées étaient arrivées.${prompt}
  7996: Quoi ? Le Consortium Brugaire ? Oh, là là. Je viens de vérifier notre entrepôt, et nous n'avons pas du tout le stock nécessaire pour faire l'expédition.${prompt}
  7997: Peut-être pouvons-nous obtenir ce dont nous avons besoin auprès d'un commerçant indépendant ?${prompt}

  8001: Alors vous le ferez ? Merci beaucoup ! Écoutez bien, et je vais vous expliquer ce que vous devez faire.${prompt}
  8002: Un commerçant indépendant nommé Alexius passe souvent par la Forêt de Jugner. C'est l'un de nos fournisseurs d'armes.${prompt}
  8003: 'Prenez ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} à Alexius, et il vous donnera ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} en échange. Ramenez cela ici.${prompt}'

  8005: Hein ? Vous ne le ferez pas ? C'est dommage. Eh bien, revenez si vous changez d'avis.${prompt}
  8006: C'est une commande urgente, alors allez-y dès que possible. N'oubliez pas de donner la commande au commerçant indépendant Alexius dans la Forêt de Jugner.${prompt}
  8007: Vous êtes revenu, et avec le reçu ! Splendide. Grâce à vous, nous pouvons rendre le consortium heureux !${prompt}
  8008: Voici un paiement pour vos services. Veillez à l'utiliser judicieusement !${prompt}

  8010: Il est de retour encore une fois...${prompt}
  8011: Il vient tous les jours regarder, mais jamais acheter ! On dit qu'il est un Chevalier Royal, et qu'il est assez passionné par les armes.${prompt}

  8017: Bien sûr, je pourrais prendre les deux... Non, je ne peux pas ! La langue de ma femme est plus acérée que n'importe quelle lame.${prompt}

    Parlez-moi de votre fils.
    Parlez-moi de vous.
    Avez-vous d'autres membres de la famille?${prompt}
  8092: Je ne peux pas me déplacer beaucoup à cause--à cause de ma maladie, donc Raminel fait son travail de livraison pour nous soutenir.${prompt}
  8093: 'Le médecin m’a dit que j’avais--j’avais la fièvre de Davoi : une maladie qui attaque les poumons, seulement trouvée dans cette partie du monde.${prompt}'
  8094: Ne vous inquiétez pas, ce n'est pas contagieux ; je vis toujours avec mon fils, après tout. Mais je ne peux pas--je ne peux pas arrêter de tousser !${prompt}
  8095: Il y a longtemps, j'étais sœur à l'abbaye de Davoi.${prompt}
  8096: Mais un jour, les Orques ont attaqué le village--une grande armée. Ils ont pris l'abbaye, et moi... non, toutes les sœurs, ont été chassées de notre maison.${prompt}
  8097: J'ai entendu plus tard que l'abbaye était tombée en ruine. Je ne voudrais pas la voir maintenant, de peur que mon cœur ne se brise...${prompt}
  8098: Je vis ici avec mon fils Raminel. Mon mari est décédé il y a cinq ans.${prompt}
  8099: Vous savez, beaucoup d'Elvaans vivaient autrefois à Davoi. Mais le village est tombé en ruine après la Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans. Une maladie appelée la fièvre de Davoi s'est répandue parmi les survivants.${prompt}
  8100: Fuyant les feux de la guerre, les réfugiés de Davoi ont afflué vers San d'Oria, mais pour ceux atteints de la fièvre de Davoi, il n'y avait pas d'échappatoire.${prompt}
  8101: La fièvre se caractérise par une toux violente. Vers la fin, les toux deviennent incessantes, sapant la vie de la victime jusqu'à sa mort.${prompt}
  8102: Heureusement, ce n'est pas contagieux, mais malheureusement, il n'existe aucun remède connu.${prompt}
  8103: C'est à moi ! Rendez-le moi !${prompt}
  8104: Tu es tellement égoïste ! Je t'ai prêté quelque chose hier ! Quand vas-tu me le rendre ?${prompt}
  8105: De quoi vous chamaillez-vous, hein ?${prompt}

  8107: Je ne vole pas ! Ce gamin ne veut pas me rendre le jouet que je lui ai prêté !${prompt}
  8108: Maintenant, les garçons... Les jouets et les bonbons sont temporaires, mais vous serez frères toute votre vie. Vous comprenez ?${prompt}
  8109: Eh bien, oui, mais...${prompt}
  8110: Alors ?${prompt}
  8111: Alors, il y a beaucoup de sortes de frères dans ce monde. Certains s'entendent bien, et d'autres se battent chaque fois qu'ils se rencontrent.${prompt}
  8112: 'Ah-choo!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8113: Votre Altesse, avez-vous attrapé un rhume ?${prompt}
  8114: Oui, sans doute à cause de mon frère machiavélique Pieuje.${prompt}
  8115: Mais un jour, vous aurez besoin l'un de l'autre. Comparé à la Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans, vos disputes sont de la paille pour chocobos !${prompt}
  8116: Hmm... peut-être.${prompt}
  8117: Je suppose...${prompt}
  8118: J'entends parler de batailles dans des terres lointaines. Si une autre guerre venait, et que des monstres franchissaient ces murs ? Vous oublieriez vos querelles, alors !${prompt}
  8119: Tu penses vraiment que des monstres attaqueront ?${prompt}
  8120: Les monstres ne me font pas peur !${prompt}
  8121: Hé-hé ! C'est l'esprit ! Devenez forts, mes garçons ! Vous serez bientôt en train de tuer des hommes-bêtes !${prompt}
  8122: Quand je serai grand, j'irai combattre les monstres, comme le Prince Trion !${prompt}
  8123: Mon frère prend toujours mes bonbons ! Ce n'est pas juste !${prompt}
  8124: Attends ! Si j'avais de la magie, peut-être que je pourrais empêcher mon frère de toucher à mes bonbons...${prompt}
  8125: Il suffit de prendre vers l'ouest dans cette rue et de tourner à droite à la fin. Cela vous mènera à Watchdog Alley.${prompt}
  8126: C'est désormais un quartier résidentiel pour les écuyers de notre royaume, donc c'est tout à fait sûr. Mais autrefois, c'était un refuge pour les criminels et toutes sortes de types sordides.${prompt}
  8127: Pendant la Grande Guerre, le quartier servait même aux pendaisons publiques des bêtes capturées. Quelle pensée...${prompt}

  8544: En guise d'encouragement, nous vous attribuerons davantage de points de conquête si vous vainquez des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  8545: Mais si nous sommes alliés à une autre nation, vous n'obtiendrez que le taux normal pour vaincre les monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous accorderons plus de points si vous combattez dans les régions de la nation la mieux classée.${prompt}

    Notre principale préoccupation est que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.

    Comment vérifiez-vous la marchandise ?
    Comment retirez-vous un article ?
    Ma liste de "Statut de vente" est pleine !
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  8933: Les maisons des enchères se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. C'est là que les aventuriers se réunissent pour enchérir sur les dépouilles de bataille, les objets non désirés, les anciennes armures... presque tout.${prompt}
  8934: Actuellement, les maisons des enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix diffèrent d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  8935: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison des enchères, quelles que soient leur nationalité.${prompt}
  8936: Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou au-dessus l'achètera automatiquement.${prompt}
  8937: Une fois mis aux enchères, les marchandises y resteront pendant un maximum de trente semaines de temps Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi de temps Terre).${prompt}
  8938: Si les marchandises ne se vendent pas dans ce délai, elles seront renvoyées à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  8939: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un objet est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les objets simples et les objets empilables.${prompt}
  8940: Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsque n'importe quelle marchandise est mise aux enchères. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
  8941: Le Comité International des Maisons des Enchères, ou CIME, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles pouvaient être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
  8942: Cependant, le CIME a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles qu'une personne peut acheter.${prompt}
  8943: Un petit laps de temps est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises n'apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
  8944: Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste de "Statut de vente", il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
  8945: Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une vente aux enchères, vous devez vous rendre à la maison des enchères et sélectionner "Arrêter la vente" dans le menu "Statut de vente".${prompt}
  8946: Pour retirer un article de votre liste de "Statut de vente", vous devez vous rendre à un comptoir d'enchères pour confirmer la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
  8947: Sinon, les articles déjà vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
  8948: À n'importe quel comptoir d'enchères, ouvrez le menu "Statut de vente" et confirmez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
  8949: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
  8950: Y a-t-il autre chose que vous aimeriez savoir ?${prompt}

  9100: Eh bien, il semble que vous ayez affronté un grand danger là-bas. Mais vous avez trouvé de nouveaux atours pour le combat, donc tout va bien. N'est-ce pas, Sharzalion ?${prompt}
  9101: Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? Ce n'est pas du tout comme vous.${prompt}
  9102: Alors, la rumeur était vraie...${prompt}
  9103: Rumeur ?${prompt}
  9104: Oui, au sujet de la mort de Rainemard. Certains disent qu'il a été tué parce qu'il en savait trop.${prompt}
  9105: Trop sur quoi ?${prompt}
  9106: Je ne sais pas. Il serait sûrement préférable de ne pas aller plus loin. Pour ma part, je vais faire comme si je n'avais pas entendu ce qui a été dit aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  9107: Vous n'êtes jamais aussi timide.${prompt}
  9108: La discrétion, mon ami, est la meilleure partie du courage.${prompt}
  9109: Dites... Je connais un moyen de parler aux morts. Qu'en dites-vous ?${prompt}
  9110: Valdero, non !${prompt}
  9111: 'À Fei’Yin, il y a une vieille fontaine asséchée. Ils disent que vous pouvez appeler l’esprit des morts en y jetant simplement ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Quoi qu’il en soit, cet endroit est une ruine décrépite, donc il n’y a pas de fin aux rumeurs stupides.${prompt}'
  9112: Ne croyez pas un mot de cela, mon ami.${prompt}
  9113: Fei'Yin n'est pas un endroit pour vous. Et quelque chose ne tourne pas rond là-dedans. J'ai l'impression que quelque chose... une main invisible nous guide quelque part. Je ne veux plus rien avoir à faire avec ça !${prompt}
  9114: Quoi, vous êtes allé à Fei'Yin ? Et vous dites que le fantôme de Rainemard a besoin d'aide ? Je suis désolé, mon ami, mais je ne veux plus rien avoir à faire avec ça.${prompt}
  9115: Donc, tout ce tumulte à l'église était l'œuvre de Rainemard... Eh bien, je suis heureux que son esprit ait trouvé le repos, et que vous en soyez sorti sain et sauf.${prompt}
  9116: Les aventuriers doivent savoir saisir les opportunités ! Bien qu'il y ait une fine ligne entre bravoure et folie !${prompt}
  9117: J'adore une bonne histoire de fantômes. La meilleure partie de diriger une taverne est d'écouter toutes les histoires que les aventuriers rapportent de loin.${prompt}
  9118: 'À Fei’Yin, il y a une vieille fontaine asséchée. Ils disent que vous pouvez appeler l’esprit des morts en y jetant simplement ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Quoi qu’il en soit, cet endroit est une ruine décrépite, donc il n’y a pas de fin aux rumeurs stupides.${prompt}'
  9119: Donc, la rumeur était vraie ? Hourra ! Non, je n'ai pas besoin de remerciements. Je suis heureux d'avoir simplement entendu votre histoire.${prompt}
  9120: Mais que pourrait-il vouloir dire par un “petit endroit sombre et étroit” ? Vous feriez mieux de demander aux autres clients ou membres de votre propre groupe pour leur avis.${prompt}
  9121: Oui, peut-être que son cadavre a été enterré dans la Citadelle de Garlaige. Quelle chose cruelle à faire !${prompt}
  9122: Tout est bien qui finit bien, comme on dit. J'ai passé un bon moment à tout entendre ! S'il vous plaît, arrêtez-vous si vous êtes dans le coin.${prompt}
  9123: Vous êtes courageux de me parler ! Mais si vous cherchez des pistes, je n'en ai aucune à partager.${prompt}
  9124: 'Eh bien, je suis après un certain coffre dans la Citadelle de Garlaige. J’ai entendu dire que vous pouvez l’ouvrir avec ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, mais je me demande s’il y a un trésor caché à l’intérieur.${prompt}'
  9125: Vous avez trouvé un cadavre à l'intérieur ? Je cherchais ce coffre, mais maintenant je suis content de ne pas l'avoir ouvert.${prompt}
  9126: C'est une boîte de Pandore que je ne veux jamais rencontrer !${prompt}

    L'avez-vous eu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Haha, oui.
    Euh, non.${prompt}
  9128: Heh, je le pensais bien. Nous, les aventuriers, avons besoin d'un sens de l'humour !${prompt}
  9129: Vous n'avez aucun sens de l'humour. ${prompt}
  9130: Hmm... Mes propres armes ne font toujours pas le poids contre elles... ${prompt}
  9131: Père ! ${prompt}
  9132: Oh, Ailbeche. As-tu fait cette course pour moi ? ${prompt}
  9133: Um, oui. Et, j'ai aussi une faveur à te demander, père. ${prompt}
  9134: Une faveur ? ${prompt}
  9135: 'Oui, je veux ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Mes amis ont dit qu’ils m’emmèneraient ensuite pêcher. ${prompt}'
  9136: Ailbeche, ce n'est pas quelque chose qu'un vrai ami dirait. Tu devrais choisir tes amis plus soigneusement. ${prompt}
  9137: Et j'ai du travail à faire. Tu le sais, n'est-ce pas ? ${prompt}
  9138: Oui, Père. ${prompt}
  9139: 'Pourquoi, ces ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sont des Chevaliers Royaux. Comment les as-tu obtenus ? Je devrais en informer le Prince Trion. ${prompt}'
  9140: Que veux-tu ? J'attends quelqu'un. Chaque fois que la porte s'ouvre, je me retourne pour regarder ! Va-t'en ! ${prompt}
  9141: Ce n'est pas de tes affaires. Pars tout de suite ! ${prompt}
  9142: Pourquoi es-tu là ? Tu demandes des nouvelles de mon fils ? S'il te plaît, va-t'en ! ${prompt}
  9143: Je sais tout sur les intrigues des chevaliers ! J'ai entendu dire que quelque chose n'allait pas dès que mon fils a disparu. Je sais qu'ils y sont pour quelque chose ! ${prompt}
  9144: Je suis un évaluateur employé par Madame Hinaree. Feu son mari était un grand collectionneur. Ce sont tous de belles œuvres ! ${prompt}
  9145: Le portrait au-dessus de l'escalier est particulièrement précieux. Il est de Mique, l'artiste de cour du Roi Ranperre. Dommage que si peu de ses œuvres aient survécu ! ${prompt}
  9146: Le plus grand mystère entourant Mique est son pinceau. On dit que ses poils deviennent féroces lorsque le peintre a peur et délicats lorsqu'il est triste. ${prompt}
  9147: 'Tout artiste désirerait ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Certains disent qu’il était caché dans le château de Zvahl, mais je ne les crois pas. ${prompt}'
  9148: Connais-tu quelqu'un qui cherche un modèle ? Je pourrais utiliser l'argent. ${prompt}
  9149: Chusarlaud peignait souvent mon portrait. Il était tellement talentueux. Certains de ses tableaux sont ici, dans cette taverne. ${prompt}
  9150: Mais maintenant, personne ne fait plus de portraits, alors je ne trouve pas de travail ! ${prompt}
  9151: 'Pourtant, il souhaitait toujours avoir ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} quand son moral était bas. Vemalpeau, son père, l’a aussi cherché, mais il n’a jamais été trouvé. ${prompt}'
  9152: Quoi ? Tu n'as jamais entendu parler de Mique ? Rends-toi à la maison de Madame Hinaree. Une image vaut mille mots, dit-on. ${prompt}
  9153: Pourquoi tu me l'offrirais ? C'est le pinceau que Chusarlaud a toujours voulu. Comment le savais-tu ? ${prompt}
  9154: Dans sa jeunesse, il voulait être peintre. Mais, quand sa mère est tombée malade, nous avons perdu les moyens, et il a décidé de devenir chevalier. Tout seul...${prompt}
  9155: Je ne pouvais tout simplement pas lui demander d'abandonner, même si je le voulais. Il était notre fierté. Comment une telle chose a-t-elle pu lui arriver ?${prompt}
  9156: Il est porté disparu depuis près d'un an, mais il y a encore une chance qu'il soit vivant. Nous avons conservé sa chambre à l'étage telle qu'elle a toujours été. Allez voir par vous-même si vous le souhaitez.${prompt}
  9157: À bien y penser, souvent il lisait une lettre de son officier commandant. Une fois, je l'ai volée pendant son absence, mais le papier était vierge.${prompt}
  9158: La plume repose dans l'encrier vide. ${prompt}
  9159: Une lettre inachevée. Elle ne dit rien de spécial. ${prompt}
  9160: Une peinture. Elle présente un travail de pinceau animé. ${prompt}
  9161: Une inspection plus approfondie révèle que toutes les peintures ici sont du même artiste. ${prompt}

    Examinez la peinture.
    Regardez derrière le cadre.

    Ouvrir et examiner.
    Laissez-le.${prompt}
  9165: Père !${prompt}
  9166: Qu'est-ce, Ailbeche ?${prompt}
  9167: Vous partez en expédition, n'est-ce pas ? Vilbert est déjà parti. Voici une épée. Maintenant, vous pouvez y aller aussi.${prompt}
  9168: Expédition ? Que voulez-vous dire ? Quoi qu'il en soit, une telle épée ne me sera d'aucune utilité.${prompt}
  9169: Mais, Père ! Maman nettoyait cette épée chaque nuit ! Comment avez-vous pu oublier ? Il m'a fallu une éternité pour enlever la rouille accumulée par votre négligence !${prompt}
  9170: Quoi ?${prompt}
  9171: Oh, laissez tomber !${prompt}
  9172: Ailbeche...${prompt}
  9173: De quoi était-il si excité ? De plus, ma division est en attente. Et où Vilbert pourrait-il partir ?${prompt}
  9174: Quoi, vous voulez que je vous parle de ce papier ? C'est un formulaire spécial que ma division utilise pour les messages. Les mots ne sont pas visibles, mais ils sont là.${prompt}
  9175: Nous ne l'utilisons plus, donc laissez-moi vous expliquer comment ça fonctionne.${prompt}
  9176: À Davoi, il y a un puits que les Orcs utilisent. Plongez le papier dans son eau et l'écriture réapparaîtra.${prompt}
  9177: Autrefois, nous gardions l'eau dans nos encriers pour l'utiliser lors de la lecture des messages, mais maintenant même le mien est sec. Prenez celui-ci au puits si vous devez le lire.${prompt}
  9178: Il dit quoi ? Je vous croirais, mais je ne peux pas.${prompt}
  9179: Oh, que le diable l'emporte ! Dans mon cœur, je me demandais s'il n'avait pas découvert quelque chose de trop gros pour lui. Donc, mes craintes étaient vraies...${prompt}
  9180: Si seulement ce fou nous avait informés, et n'avait pas gardé ses problèmes enfouis en lui.${prompt}
  9181: Au moins, maintenant je sais qu'il lui est arrivé quelque chose. Pour cela, je vous remercie.${prompt}
  9182: Cela m'a brisé le cœur d'apprendre à son sujet, mais maintenant je connais la vérité. Vous aurez toujours ma gratitude.${prompt}
  9183: Merci pour votre aide. Je dois informer le prince Trion de ce triste événement. Je résume actuellement mon rapport.${prompt}
  9184: Actuellement, je suggère de vendre toutes les armes que nous avons achetées jusqu'à présent, mais c'est dommage de devoir vendre bas ce que nous avons acheté haut. Maintenant, je sais ce que vous, aventuriers, devez ressentir.${prompt}
  9185: Mon fils et moi allons pêcher. J’ai toujours envie de prendre la meilleure canne pour moi-même, mais je ne suis plus celui que j’étais. Nous attraperons un gros poisson avec la même canne !${prompt}
  9186: Oh, vous êtes de retour. Eh bien, si vous êtes si heureux d'avoir vaincu un ou deux Orcs, vous avez encore du chemin à parcourir !${prompt}
  9187: Pour quelqu'un de si nouveau, je serais... Hmm ?${prompt}
  9188: Seigneur chevalier, pardonnez cette interruption, mais il y a quelque chose que je dois vous demander.${prompt}
  9189: Je me demande si la reine Leaute est vraiment décédée il y a quinze ans. Dites-moi, de quelle cause est-elle décédée ?${prompt}
  9190: Qui êtes-vous, et pourquoi fouillez-vous avec de telles questions ?${prompt}
  9191: S'il vous plaît, je suis venu de loin pour voir Son Altesse !${prompt}
  9192: Vous avez quoi !?${prompt}
  9193: Très bien. Écoutez attentivement. Il y a quinze ans, la reine Leaute a succombé à une maladie rare. Elle a quitté ce monde avant que nous puissions la sauver.${prompt}
  9194: Ah, donc une maladie a emporté sa vie.${prompt}
  9195: Eh bien, cela ne vous concerne en rien de toute façon. Même si elle avait vécu, un aventurier comme vous ne pourrait jamais la voir, encore moins l'intérieur du Château d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  9196: Euh...${prompt}
  9197: Quel était le nom de sa maladie ?${prompt}
  9198: On ne nous dit pas de telles choses. Seule la famille royale le saurait.${prompt}
  9199: Est-ce ainsi ? Eh bien, je vous remercie pour votre gentillesse, fier chevalier de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9200: Hé, attendez !${prompt}
  9201: Qu'est-ce qui n'allait pas avec cet aventurier ? Il était terriblement têtu, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9202: Il semblait connaître personnellement la défunte reine, mais comment ne pouvait-il pas être au courant de sa mort ?${prompt}
  9203: En tout cas, votre travail est terminé. Excellente prestation, mon ami !${prompt}
  9204: Quoi, vous voulez la mission du rang un encore une fois ?${prompt}
  9205: 'Je savais que vous reviendriez sain et sauf, et avec le ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission accomplie !${prompt}'
  9206: Avez-vous déjà mis les pieds dans le Tombeau de King Ranperre ?${prompt}
  9207: Il y a deux cents ans, le rideau est tombé sur l'âge d'or de San d'Oria. Une guerre civile a éclaté pour l'hégémonie du royaume.${prompt}
  9208: Le roi Ranperre était là pour éteindre le conflit. Quand il est mort, il a été enterré dans un grand tombeau au sud de l'Est de Ronfaure.${prompt}
  9209: Mais des mains inconnues ont récemment profané sa tombe.${prompt}
  9210: Les visiteurs signalent des pierres tombales manquantes et des ombres se tordant dans les cavernes. Ravager une tombe royale est un crime impardonnable !${prompt}
  9211: Vos ordres sont d'enquêter sur le tombeau et de déterminer s'il y a du vrai dans ce qu'ils disent. Avez-vous compris ?${prompt}
  9212: |-
    Acceptez-vous la mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'accepte.
    Je n'accepte pas.${prompt}
  9213: Je vous implore de vous rendre rapidement au tombeau du roi Ranperre. Vous pourriez y trouver la preuve de voleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  9214: Mais si vous vous aventurez trop profondément, les gobelins pourraient vous trouver. Marchez courageusement, mon ami, mais ne vous engagez pas trop loin !${prompt}
  9215: Des visiteurs signalent des pierres tombales manquantes et des ombres se tordant dans les cavernes. Fouillez le tombeau et déterminez si ce qu'ils disent est vrai.${prompt}
  9216: Dépêchez-vous au tombeau du roi Ranperre. Vous pourriez y trouver la preuve de voleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  9217: Avez-vous vraiment fouillé le tombeau ?${prompt}
  9218: Alors, vous avez obtenu cela des chauves-souris dans le tombeau du roi Ranperre ?${prompt}
  9219: Voyez-vous, cela appartenait en réalité à un orc. Que pourraient vouloir les orcs avec le tombeau ?${prompt}
  9220: Quoi qu'il en soit, votre mission est terminée. Ne dites un mot à personne.${prompt}
  9221: Ah, le recrue est de retour ? Je suis désolé, mais je n'ai pas de temps pour vous aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  9222: Je sais que vous êtes venu jusqu'ici, mais je ne peux pas vous aider pour l'instant.${prompt}
  9223: Oh, à qui je veux faire croire ? Bien sûr que je pourrais utiliser votre aide !${prompt}
  9224: N'avez-vous pas entendu ? Des orcs sont venus et ont kidnappé des enfants ! Nous pensons qu'ils les retiennent dans leur repaire à Ghelsba.${prompt}
  9225: Eh bien, il y a peu de temps, de mauvaises nouvelles sont venues de la cathédrale. Un garçon en formation pour devenir un frère est allé près de Ghelsba et n'est pas revenu. Il s'appelait Tedimout.${prompt}
  9226: Les Chevaliers Royaux partiraient à sa rescousse, mais le prince Trion est parti vers le nord et ne peut pas donner l'ordre.${prompt}
  9227: Le prince Pieuje délibère sérieusement sur l'envoi de Chevaliers du Temple à la place. Il semble que ses efforts soient concentrés sur le sauvetage des enfants, mais...${prompt}
  9228: Mais peu importe. Nous avons besoin de connaître l'ennemi. Vous devez visiter la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  9229: Un garçon en formation pour devenir un frère est allé près de Ghelsba et n'est pas revenu. Il s'appelait Tedimout.${prompt}
  9230: Les Chevaliers du Temple pourraient être mobilisés bientôt. Vous devez visiter la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  9231: Le prince Trion vient de m'informer de votre travail. Vous avez fait un excellent travail.${prompt}
  9232: Grâce à votre contribution exemplaire, ${name-player}, San d'Oria vous reconnaît désormais comme un aventurier de rang deux.${prompt}
  9233: Mais ne laissez pas cela vous monter à la tête. Ce certificat n'est valable qu'à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9234: Travaillez dur et de meilleures choses viendront, mon ami. Un jour, votre nom sera connu également de nos alliés.${prompt}
  9235: Oh, et une dernière chose. Le vicaire de la cathédrale a dit qu'il voulait vous remercier au nom du garçon.${prompt}
  9236: Vous avez atteint le rang deux.${prompt}
  9237: En tout cas, vous avez bien accompli la mission. Il est temps pour une récompense !${prompt}
  9238: Je vous accorde des points de rang proportionnels à votre réussite.${prompt}
  9239: Le prince Trion a ordonné l'envoi d'éclaireurs des Chevaliers Royaux à Davoi, tandis que le prince Pieuje a ordonné l'envoi d'éclaireurs des Chevaliers du Temple. C'est comme si la main droite ne savait pas ce que fait la main gauche !${prompt}
  9240: Monarlais Halver est furieux, mais d'abord il a besoin de savoir. Vous devez trouver l'éclaireur des Chevaliers du Temple, recevoir son rapport d'exploration et rapporter ce rapport au monarlais.${prompt}
  9241: 'Quoi ? On vous a dit de remettre les ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} au prince Pieuje en personne ?${prompt}'
  9242: Eh bien, vous devriez trouver Son Altesse dans la cathédrale.${prompt}
  9243: 'Vous êtes arrivé juste à temps ! Le prince Trion veut vous parler. Il semble qu’il ait entendu parler de vous lorsque vous avez reçu votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9244: Rendez-vous dans les appartements du prince Trion à l'intérieur du Château d'Oraguille dès que vous serez présentable !${prompt}
  9245: Le prince Trion vous a appelé. Rendez-vous dans sa chambre à l'intérieur du Château d'Oraguille dès que vous serez présentable !${prompt}
  9246: Je ne sais pas ce que le prince Trion voulait que vous fassiez, mais menez-le à bien ! Vous comprenez ?${prompt}
  9247: Bonjour. Ce n'est pas le moment pour des missions ; le Château d'Oraguille a été visité par des bandits !${prompt}
  9248: Vous devez vous rendre au Château d'Oraguille au plus vite ! Trouvez Lady Curilla, général des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  9249: L'infiltration de bandits au Château d'Oraguille est sans précédent dans l'histoire ! Dépêchez-vous et voyez Lady Curilla, général des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  9250: 'Avec quoi a-t-on l’habitude d’affûter un couteau ? Comment ? Vous n’avez jamais entendu parler de ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'
  9251: 'Dans les Cavernes d’Ordelle, il y a un endroit avec un trou au-dessus, où souffle une brise fraîche. Là, vous pouvez trouver ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, qui rend la lame coupante comme du beurre !${prompt}'

    Rahal a une lettre pour moi à lire, n'est-ce pas ?
    Trop occupé pour venir lui-même, hmm ?
    Bien, voyons cela...${prompt}
  9255: Ah. C'est l'écriture d'Ancolain B Feulart, ancien second commandant des Chevaliers Royaux.${prompt}

  9257: Pourquoi me fais-tu cela...?${prompt}

    Et c'est là votre arrogance.
    Il y a eu de nombreuses occasions où vous avez ignoré les ordres de votre général et mené les chevaliers sur un chemin de votre choix.${prompt}
  9263: Et n'ai-je pas toujours mené à la victoire en le faisant ?${prompt}

    Au prix de la vie de nombreux de nos hommes.

    Quoi...!
    Ah, je comprends.
    Vous dites que San d'Oria n'a plus besoin de moi.${prompt}

    Non, je crois que je vais prendre congé des chevaliers.
    Je trouverai un endroit où l'on m'apprécie pour ce que je suis.
    Puissiez-vous ne pas regretter vos paroles d'aujourd'hui, Sir Balasiel.${prompt}
  9268: Ancolain a donc lancé un défi aux chevaliers royaux, n'est-ce pas ? \nIl semble que mes paroles n'aient eu aucun effet sur lui...\n Dommage.${prompt}

  9303: Les épreuves que vous avez endurées à San d'Oria - la douleur, la colère, les larmes et le rire...${prompt}
  9304: Ces souvenirs resteront à jamais dans votre cœur et ne s'effaceront jamais...${prompt}
  9305: Jusqu'à la fin...${prompt}
  9306: La fin des temps...${prompt}
  9307: Ah, tu as l'air d'avoir passé de nombreux jours avec une arme d'hast à tes côtés. Depuis longtemps, j'attends un aventurier de ton calibre.${prompt}$
  9308: Le Prince Trion m'a confié une tâche importante. Laissez-moi vous expliquer...${prompt}
  9309: Bien qu'il n'y ait pas d'armée dans tout Vana'diel qui puisse égaler l'escrime des chevaliers de San d'Oria, nos rangs manquent encore de formation dans les techniques de la hallebarde. Ce manque de compétence limite notre polyvalence au combat.${prompt}
  9310: À l'époque où le Roi Dragon régnait sur la terre, même le capitaine des Chevaliers Royaux, Erpalacion, était un maître de la lance. Cependant, avec le déclin du nombre de dragoon, les techniques utilisées par ces grands hommes ont pratiquement été perdues.${prompt}
  9311: Pour faire face à ce problème imminent, le prince m'a demandé de construire un ensemble de lignes directrices pour maîtriser l'art de la hallebarde.${prompt}
  9312: C'est là que vous intervenez. Je voudrais que vous m'aidiez à tester les nouvelles directives que j'ai élaborées.${prompt}
  9313: |-
    Pouvez-vous prêter votre assistance ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ce serait un honneur !
    J'ai des affaires plus importantes.${prompt}
  9314: |-
    Parlez comme un véritable défenseur de la force.
    Nous commencerons par effectuer un entraînement de base.${prompt}
  9315: Prenez cette arme d'hast et combattez à votre guise. L'arme transmettra sa puissance dans votre corps. Lorsqu'elle aura été vidée de toute son énergie, vous saurez que vos compétences auront été affinées et que votre entraînement est presque terminé.${prompt}
  9316: Quand vous sentirez que le moment est venu, revenez vers moi avec la lance, et j'évaluerai vos progrès.${prompt}
  9317: |-
    Je vois...
    Ce n'est pas tous les jours que je rencontre un aventurier de votre compétence. J'étais sûr que nous aurions pu tous les deux bénéficier de mon offre...
    Si vous changez d'avis un jour, je vous attendrai ici pour votre retour.${prompt}
  9318: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Comment se passe votre entraînement ?
    Montrez-moi la lance que je vous ai confiée et je pourrai évaluer vos progrès. Ou bien m'avez-vous appelé pour une autre raison...?${prompt}
  9319: |-
    Quel est le but de votre visite ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'ai perdu la ${item-singular: 1[2]}...
    Je demande à me retirer de l'entraînement.
    Je passais juste par là.${prompt}
  9320: |-
    Perdue ? Vous l'avez perdue !?
    Savez-vous les ennuis que j'ai été obligé de subir avec ces escrocs du Consortium Brugaire pour obtenir cette arme d'hast ?${prompt}
  9321: |-
    <Soupir>
    ...Je m'excuse pour mon emportement. C'était moi qui ai demandé vos services dans cette affaire. S'il vous plaît, prenez cette lance et continuez votre entraînement. Cependant, vous devrez recommencer depuis le début.
    Et s'il vous plaît, essayez de ne pas la perdre celle-ci...${prompt}
  9322: Ai-je demandé trop même pour vous ? Non, cela ne pouvait pas être... Mes années d'expérience m'ont conduit à l'élaboration de ces directives d'entraînement.${prompt}
  9323: |-
    Vous envisagez vraiment d'abandonner ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'en ai assez.
    En y réfléchissant...${prompt}
  9324: Je savais que vous étiez la personne pour cette tâche. Quiconque ne peut pas gérer un entraînement aussi simple que celui-ci n'a pas le droit de tenir une arme d'hast entre ses mains.${prompt}
  9325: Si vous vous fatiguez de votre entraînement, alors reposez-vous. Bien que la gloire ne revienne pas à ceux qui fuient les épreuves auxquelles ils sont confrontés, il faut aussi se rappeler qu'un véritable maître ne naît pas en une seule journée. ${prompt}
  9326: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? N'avez-vous aucune foi en mes directives ?${prompt}
  9327: |-
    Je ne peux pas croire ce que j'entends...
    Laissez-moi tranquille ! Je vais chercher un aventurier plus adapté pour accomplir cette tâche.${prompt}
  9328: Je suis désolé, mais je ne crois pas que vous ayez utilisé cette arme à sa pleine capacité. Continuez votre entraînement. Vous saurez quand vous aurez atteint votre objectif.${prompt}
  9329: |-
    Excellent !
    L'usure de cette arme est le reflet direct de vos progrès.${prompt}
  9330: Tout ce qui reste maintenant est la dernière partie de votre formation, où vous devez utiliser vos techniques nouvellement acquises dans un combat à mort. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais je suis sûr que votre expérience vous guidera vers la victoire.${prompt}
  9331: 'Prenez ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et rendez-vous au Grotto du Serpent de Mer. Là-bas, vous trouverez ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} enterré dans la terre. Vous devez le ramener ici.${prompt}'
  9332: Ne considérez pas cela comme une simple commission. C'est votre dernier test, et cela nécessitera toutes les connaissances et l'expérience que vous avez acquises tout au long de cette formation.${prompt}
  9333: 'Maintenant, préparez-vous pour ce combat de la manière que vous jugerez appropriée. Vous n’aurez plus besoin de l’${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9334: |-
    Prenez ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et rendez-vous au Grotto du Serpent de Mer. Là-bas, vous trouverez ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} enterré dans la terre. Vous devez le ramener ici.
    Bonne chance.${prompt}
  9335: Vous avez l'air beaucoup plus fort que lorsque je vous ai vu pour la dernière fois. Vous avez certainement terminé avec succès le cours de formation que j'ai établi dans mes directives !${prompt}
  9336: Cela prouve que mes méthodes peuvent être d'une grande importance pour le Royaume ! J'attends avec impatience le jour où nos chevaliers atteindront le niveau que vous avez déjà acquis.${prompt}
  9337: Balasiel, comment se passe la préparation de nos nouvelles directives ?${prompt}
  9338: |-
    Mon Seigneur !
    Avec l'assistance de ce noble ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/lady], j'ai pu achever mon écriture. Il ne faudra pas longtemps avant que ces maudits orcs tremblent à la vue de nos nouveaux chevaliers entraînés.${prompt}
  9339: |-
    C'est en effet une bonne nouvelle.
    ${name-player}, je vous remercie pour votre travail pour aider San d'Oria. Je pense que je pourrais me rendre sur le terrain d'entraînement moi-même pour essayer ces nouvelles techniques de première main.${prompt}
  9340: Prince Trion, vous ne pouvez pas être sérieux... !${prompt}
  9341: Hah hah hah ! Balasiel, bien sûr que c'était une blague !${prompt}
  9342: Je m'excuse, mon Seigneur. Cependant, cela n'avait pas l'air beaucoup d'une blague...${prompt}
  9343: Balasiel. Une fois votre rapport terminé, remettez-le à Monarlais Halver. Il continuera les préparatifs à partir de là.${prompt}
  9344: Oui, mon Seigneur !${prompt}
  9345: |-
    Je ne saurais trop vous remercier pour tout ce que vous avez fait. Si ce n'était pour vous, je n'aurais pas pu achever mon travail.
    Bientôt, tous les chevaliers de San d'Oria poliront leurs compétences au bâton avec la nouvelle “Méthode ${name-player}.”${prompt}
  9346: Je regrette de ne pas pouvoir vous rembourser pour le temps que vous avez passé à m'assister. Cependant, vous réaliserez bientôt que votre entraînement a débloqué une puissante force en vous. Cette nouvelle compétence est votre véritable récompense.${prompt}
  9347: Je vous remercie encore pour votre assistance. Et souvenez-vous, cette compétence nouvellement acquise n'est pas la fin de votre entraînement, mais le début.${prompt}
  9348: Vous avez appris la compétence d'arme “Coup d'impulsion” !${prompt}
  9349: |-
    Bonjour, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame].
    Je m'appelle Phillone. J'ai récemment déménagé ici depuis Bastok avec mon mari et mon frère cadet.${prompt}
  9350: "Et où sont-ils maintenant, vous demandez ? Ils... ils sont très occupés avec leur travail ! Tellement que je les vois rarement à la maison ces jours-ci. \nN'hésitez pas à revenir pour une autre visite un jour !${prompt}"
  9351: Je dois rester calme... rester concentré. J'ai enfin eu la chance de dépasser cette existence misérable de garde-porte. Si seulement je pouvais leur montrer ce que je vaux...${prompt}
  9352: Quoi- !${prompt}
  9353: Mon devoir est de garder cette porte de la ville ! Je n'envisageais certainement pas de partir pour attraper ce voleur pour une gloire vulgaire et une reconnaissance !${prompt}
  9354: '...${prompt}'
  9355: Oh, ce n'est qu'un aventurier. Vous m'avez fait peur.${prompt}
  9356: Un cambrioleur s'est introduit dans le trésor royal l'autre jour et a dérobé le précieux Sceptre Royaulais.${prompt}
  9357: Peut-être que c'était vous !?${prompt}
  9358: Non, votre visage ne correspond pas à celui du croquis que j'ai vu.${prompt}
  9359: |-
    Je m'excuse pour mon accusation précipitée.
    Les Chevaliers du Temple ont parcouru tout le royaume, mais n'ont encore découvert aucun indice concernant le lieu où se trouve le voleur.${prompt}
  9360: N'avez-vous jamais entendu parler du Sceptre Royaulais ? C'est le sceptre porté par le roi, un symbole de fonction décerné par le pape lors de la cérémonie de couronnement.${prompt}
  9361: Moi aussi, je souhaite un jour me faire un nom dans ce monde.${prompt}
  9362: Nous avons enfin trouvé une piste !${prompt}
  9363: Un marchand ambulant a signalé la présence d'un individu suspect rôdant dans le Plateau de La Theine ! Il pourrait bien s'agir du cambrioleur que nous recherchons.${prompt}
  9364: Parlez-vous sérieusement !?${prompt}
  9365: |-
    Je suis Elmemague des Chevaliers du Temple.
    Je dois me rendre sur le site d'exercice de secours dans le Plateau de La Theine et rejoindre mes compagnons.${prompt}
  9366: |-
    Cependant, si notre proie est le cambrioleur qui a réussi à s'infiltrer dans le château seul, je crains que notre nombre ne soit trop peu élevé.
    Je demande que vous contactiez les Chevaliers Royaux pour envoyer des renforts !${prompt}
  9367: Les Chevaliers Royaux sont postés au-delà des frontières du royaume ! Recruter l'assistance même des chevaliers les plus proches prendra du temps.${prompt}
  9368: Mille diables ! Le scélérat ne tardera pas...${prompt}
  9369: Pourquoi, la solution est là, sous vos yeux ! Je comprends que cela puisse être dangereux, mais quelqu'un doit accompagner...${prompt}
  9370: "Bien sûr ! \nAventurier ! Ne prêteriez-vous pas main-forte ? Si le voleur est attrapé, vous serez généreusement récompensé !${prompt}"
  9371: Attendez, ce que je voulais dire, c'est que je pourrais y aller avec...${prompt}
  9372: Venez, aventurier ! Le trésor royal doit être arraché des mains de ce vilain !${prompt}
  9373: |-
    Allez-vous aider ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Montrez le chemin !
    Je ne peux pas aider pour le moment...${prompt}
  9374: |-
    Je vois...
    Si jamais vous changez d'avis, parlez au garde ici. Votre aide serait grandement appréciée.${prompt}
  9375: Vous allez aider ? Splendide ! Alors partons pour le Plateau de La Theine et unissons nos forces avec le reste de mes hommes !${prompt}
  9376: Je, euh, je vous accompagnerai dans cette mission importante...${prompt}
  9377: Vous devez rester ici. Quand les chevaliers reviendront de leurs patrouilles, dites-leur de se dépêcher de se rendre au Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  9378: '...Oui, monsieur.${prompt}'
  9379: Pas de tergiversations, aventurier ! Nous partons immédiatement !${prompt}
  9380: |-
    Peu importe. Je ne suis nullement déçu.
    Être un "simple garde-porte" semble être mon destin dans cette vie...${prompt}
  9381: Eh bien, c'est dommage. Votre aide aurait été utile.${prompt}
  9382: Je reviendrai bientôt !${prompt}
  9383: |-
    Peu importe, vraiment.
    Être un "simple garde-porte" semble être mon destin dans cette vie...${prompt}
  9384: Sir Elmemague a demandé l'assistance d'aventuriers pour capturer le voleur présumé qui rôde dans le Plateau de La Theine...${prompt}
  9385: Alors vous devez vous dépêcher pour le Plateau de La Theine. Les chevaliers là-bas vous donneront de plus amples instructions.${prompt}
  9386: |-
    Je comprends.
    Si c'était moi, je proposerais mon épée en un battement de cœur...${prompt}
  9387: |-
    Vous avez déjà oublié ?
    Rendez-vous au Plateau de La Theine, et les chevaliers là-bas vous donneront de plus amples instructions.${prompt}
  9388: Je ne ressens pas le moindre soupçon d'envie. Je n'ai absolument aucun intérêt à me prouver par des actes d'honneur et de courage...${prompt}
  9389: Oh, c'est vous. Comment ça s'est passé pour vous ?${prompt}
  9390: Alors ils l'ont attrapé, n'est-ce pas ? Comme il doit être merveilleux de se tenir à l'avant-garde de l'action...${prompt}
  9391: Est-ce vrai !?${prompt}
  9392: Et vous êtes, madame ?${prompt}
  9393: |-
    Je m'appelle Phillone.
    Qu'est-il advenu de celui qui a volé le Sceptre Royaulais ? L'ont-ils attrapé ? Est-il indemne ?${prompt}
  9394: Un individu très suspect a été appréhendé à La Theine, mais s'il est réellement le criminel reste à voir...${prompt}
  9395: Il n'est pas une mauvaise personne... il n'est pas un criminel. Je vous en prie, vous devez l'aider !${prompt}
  9396: Le suspect ?${prompt}
  9397: Vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Je vous en supplie, vous devez faire quelque chose !${prompt}
  9398: Cela ne dépend plus de nous...${prompt}
  9399: '...${prompt}'
  9400: Pardonnez l'attitude de ma femme. Je suis son mari, Roido.${prompt}
  9401: Allons, Phillone, rentrons chez nous. Tout ira bien. Tu verras.${prompt}
  9402: Mais...${prompt}
  9403: J'ai dit, rentrons... !${prompt}
  9404: De quoi parlait-elle, je me demande...${prompt}
  9405: Ah oui, j'allais presque oublier. Si l'homme qu'ils ont attrapé est vraiment le voleur, vous aurez droit à une récompense de la part de Monarlais Halver. Pourquoi n'iriez-vous pas au château pour vérifier la situation ?${prompt}
  9406: Si l'homme qu'ils ont attrapé est vraiment le voleur, vous aurez droit à une récompense de la part de Monarlais Halver. Pourquoi n'iriez-vous pas au château pour vérifier la situation ?${prompt}
  9407: |-
    Je m'excuse pour mon emportement plus tôt. J'ai été un peu souffrant...
    Veuillez oublier ce que j'ai dit.${prompt}
  9408: Hmm, donc l'homme qu'ils ont attrapé n'était pas celui qui a volé le Sceptre Royaulais ?${prompt}
  9409: "Ce qui signifie que j'ai encore une chance ! Je vais attraper ce voleur et montrer à tout le monde de quoi je suis capable. \nJe serai un chevalier célèbre !${prompt}"
  9410: '...${prompt}'
  9411: Oh, vous étiez au château.${prompt}
  9412: Ne bougez pas ! Vous êtes le vaurien qui s'est enfui avec le sceptre, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
  9413: Jeune homme, connaissez-vous les personnages éminents du roi Raigegue et du prince Fellenant ?${prompt}
  9414: |-
    Hein ? Eh bien, oui.
    Ils faisaient partie de la famille royale de San d'Oria il y a deux cents ans. C'est leur lutte pour le contrôle du Royaume qui a causé la guerre civile avant l'époque du roi Ranperre.${prompt}
  9415: |-
    Vous en êtes sûr !?
    Alors les troubles internes ont commencé...${prompt}
  9416: Hmm, cela se serait passé plusieurs années après notre défaite écrasante lors de la Deuxième Bataille de Konschtat.${prompt}
  9417: Le prince Fellenant a recruté les Chevaliers du Temple à sa cause et pris le contrôle de la ville. Il a ensuite déclaré son intention de forger une paix avec Bastok.${prompt}
  9418: Cependant, son frère aîné, le roi Raigegue, n'a pas pu pardonner les actions de son frère cadet ; cet appel à la paix est survenu au moment où le roi s'efforçait de rallier les chevaliers royaux restants pour une contre-attaque contre la République.${prompt}
  9419: Et Vijartal Caphieux !?${prompt}
  9420: |-
    Vous ne savez vraiment pas ?
    Il est l'un des plus grands héros de l'histoire de notre royaume. C'est pendant la guerre civile que Vijartal Caphieux s'est distingué par ses actions vaillantes. Je doute que le plus petit enfant à San d'Oria soit ignorant de ses exploits.${prompt}
  9421: Vous vous moquez de moi... n'est-ce pas ? Est-ce donc le monde du futur ? Quelle idée ridicule...${prompt}
  9422: Quel personnage étrange. Peu importe. Ce sur quoi je devrais me concentrer maintenant, c'est la capture de ce scélérat et la récupération du Sceptre Royaulais.${prompt}
  9423: |-
    C'est ça !
    Vous souvenez-vous de la dame qui s'est présentée sous le nom de Phillone ? Je pense que son histoire mérite une enquête plus approfondie, mais je ne peux pas quitter mon poste.${prompt}
  9424: Pourriez-vous aller en apprendre davantage sur elle en tant que service pour moi ? Je dois résoudre ce crime si je veux un jour être remarqué par mes supérieurs. S'il vous plaît, faites-moi savoir si vous découvrez quelque chose d'important.${prompt}
  9425: Pourriez-vous aller en apprendre davantage sur la dame qui se fait appeler Phillone ? Je dois résoudre ce crime si je veux un jour être remarqué par mes supérieurs. S'il vous plaît, faites-moi savoir si vous découvrez quelque chose d'important.${prompt}
  9426: Vous... vous êtes l'aventurier avec qui j'ai parlé auparavant ! Que s'est-il passé avec l'homme qu'ils ont attrapé ? Était-il indemne !?${prompt}
  9427: Quoi ? Il n'était pas le voleur qu'ils recherchaient ?${prompt}
  9428: Naphee, c'est toi !${prompt}
  9429: |-
    Quel soulagement...
    Je suis tellement content que tu sois là ! Ce n'est pas un monde futuriste après tout !${prompt}
  9430: Excusez-moi, monsieur, mais je ne crois pas que nous nous soyons déjà rencontrés...${prompt}
  9431: J'ai eu une journée des plus éprouvantes. Des bêtises ennuyeuses de la part des gens du château, toute cette histoire selon laquelle je serais une sorte de héros...${prompt}
  9432: Mes os ont besoin de repos, cher Naphee. Je pense que je vais faire une petite sieste, si cela ne te dérange pas.${prompt}
  9433: Un instant ! Qui êtes-vous, monsieur ? On ne se permet pas d'entrer dans la maison des gens comme bon leur semble !${prompt}
  9434: De quoi parles-tu, Naphee ?${prompt}
  9435: Naphee ? Je m'appelle Phillone !${prompt}
  9436: Je n'ai pas l'humeur à ces jeux, surtout pas chez moi. J'attends plus de ma seule et unique amour.${prompt}
  9437: |-
    Ton amour !?
    Que diable racontes-tu !? Pars sur-le-champ ou j'appellerai les Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  9438: |-
    Phillone ?
    Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? Tu es toute rouge.${prompt}
  9439: |-
    Un Hume... et cet accent...
    Tu ne peux pas être de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9440: Eh bien, oui, je le suis.${prompt}
  9441: Tu as vraiment du cran de poser le pied dans la sainte ville de San d'Oria ! Ou peut-être t'es-tu échappé de ta cellule de prison ?${prompt}
  9442: C'est chez moi. Ai-je fait quelque chose de mal dont je ne suis pas au courant ?${prompt}
  9443: |-
    Je ne comprends pas...
    Mon esprit doit me jouer des tours...${prompt}
  9444: C'est chez moi, n'est-ce pas ? Et pourtant, je trouve un Bastokien sale vivant ici avec une femme qui devrait être ma chère Naphee.${prompt}
  9445: Où sur Vana'diel est cet endroit ? Ai-je vraiment été catapulté dans le futur ?${prompt}
  9446: "Qui était cet homme ? \nEt pourquoi ai-je l'impression de l'avoir déjà rencontré quelque part...?${prompt}"
  9447: Tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Et tu cherches le voleur du Sceptre Royaulais ?${prompt}
  9448: J'ai une faveur à te demander.${prompt}
  9449: J'ai besoin de ton aide pour retrouver le sceptre volé.${prompt}
  9450: Tu vois, la personne qui a volé le Sceptre Royaulais était en fait mon frère cadet, Millechairale.${prompt}
  9451: Pardonne mes paroles précipitées tout à l'heure, aventurier. Je pensais que c'était Millechairale qui avait été capturé.${prompt}
  9452: Il y a une légende qui raconte qu'un pouvoir mystérieux est attribué à la Pierre Errante, le joyau qui orne le bout du Sceptre Royaulais. C'est pourquoi il a été transmis à travers les générations des rois de San d'Oria et est devenu un symbole de notre pays à part entière.${prompt}
  9453: Et c'est ce que Millechairale a volé...${prompt}
  9454: Mais mon frère n'est pas un voleur ordinaire ! Il n'a aucun dessein maléfique dans son cœur. Je t'en supplie, aide Millechairale...${prompt}
  9455: Craignant pour sa propre sécurité, Millechairale a caché le Sceptre Royaulais quelque part. Mon plan est de trouver cet endroit caché et de rendre le sceptre au château avant qu'il ait la chance de le récupérer.${prompt}
  9456: En faisant cela, peut-être que les chevaliers ne seront pas aussi sévères envers Millechairale s'ils viennent à le capturer. Peut-être même qu'ils abandonneront leur enquête lorsque le trésor royal sera restitué à sa place légitime.${prompt}
  9457: Mais la demande de notre ancêtre...${prompt}
  9458: Phillone. Je comprends ce que tu ressens, mais la sécurité de ton frère est plus importante.${prompt}
  9459: Je... je sais que tu as raison, mais...${prompt}
  9460: Le seul problème, c'est que l'endroit où je dois me rendre est infesté de monstres. Je ne pense pas pouvoir y arriver sans l'aide d'un chevalier expérimenté...${prompt}
  9461: Connais-tu par hasard des chevaliers de confiance qui pourraient m'aider dans cette entreprise ?${prompt}
  9462: Aventurier, s'il te plaît, aide ma famille...${prompt}
  9463: Le temps presse.${prompt}
  9464: S'il te plaît, ${name-player}. Trouve un chevalier de qualité pour sauver ma famille de cette catastrophe imminente !${prompt}
  9465: Alors, as-tu découvert quelque chose d'important ?${prompt}
  9466: Aventurier, j'ai besoin de trouver un chevalier expérimenté. Je suis désolé, mais cet homme n'est pas exactement...${prompt}
  9467: De quoi s'agit-il ?${prompt}
  9468: Oh, si ce n'est pas les mêmes messieurs avec qui je parlais plus tôt.${prompt}
  9469: Tu sembles perplexe. Hm ? Tu cherches un chevalier compétent ? Eh bien, ne cherche pas plus loin, je connais l'homme parfait pour affronter n'importe quelle situation.${prompt}
  9470: Vraiment !? Où pouvons-nous trouver cette personne ?${prompt}
  9471: Je suis Vijartal Caphieux, chevalier extraordinaire de l'illustre famille Caphieux ! Héros ancien de San d'Oria dans le monde du futur !${prompt}
  9472: Je pense que sa ceinture d'épée est un peu trop serrée...${prompt}
  9473: Un chevalier, qu'il soit du passé ou du futur, ne doit pas être dérangé par des choses triviales. Dans ce monde, je suis un héros renommé. Que dis-tu, n'es-tu pas impressionné ?${prompt}
  9474: |-
    Je dois penser à un nom plus approprié pour moi.
    Que pensez-vous de "Foudroyeur Vijartal" ? Ça a un peu plus de punch, non ?${prompt}
  9475: |-
    Hmmm, il doit y avoir quelque chose de mieux, cependant...
    J'ai trouvé ! Que diriez-vous de "Vijartal Caphieux, la Foudre d'Obsidienne" ? Ça sonne bien, vous ne trouvez pas ?${prompt}
  9476: Vijartal Caphieux ?${prompt}
  9477: |-
    La Foudre d'Obsidienne...
    Oui, j'aime ça ! Donnez-moi un peu de temps pour travailler sur une nouvelle signature.${prompt}
  9478: Excusez-moi, pourrais-je vous parler ? Nous pouvons discuter chez moi.${prompt}
  9479: Je vois. Votre histoire est bien triste. Mais pourquoi devrais-je être celui qui aide votre frère ?${prompt}
  9480: Eh bien, puisque vous vous êtes présenté comme Vijartal Caphieux, le chevalier célèbre, j'ai pensé que vous deviez être un guerrier habile. Votre aide serait la bienvenue.${prompt}
  9481: Comme je en suis sûr que ce serait le cas. Cependant, aussi grand que puisse être mon talent, il y a de nombreuses préparations que je dois faire. Mon épée a besoin de réparation, et il y a plusieurs autres choses...${prompt}
  9482: Étant donné que votre nom est le même que notre héros ancien, les Chevaliers du Temple pourraient vous laisser tranquille, même si vous êtes attrapé en nous aidant.${prompt}
  9483: Naphee, toujours avec ce ton de voix...${prompt}
  9484: Je m'appelle Phillone.${prompt}
  9485: Vous et elle êtes si semblables.${prompt}
  9486: Très bien, alors. Je vous aiderai. Tout ce que nous devons faire, c'est récupérer le Sceptre Royaulais, n'est-ce pas ? Un chevalier est tenu d'aider ceux qui sont plus faibles que lui. C'est ce que j'ai toujours... Ah, peu importe.${prompt}
  9487: Vous nous aiderez !? Merci, nous ne l'oublierons jamais pour le reste de notre...${prompt}
  9488: Cependant, je ne fais pas confiance aux Bastokers.${prompt}
  9489: Quoi ?${prompt}
  9490: Les gens de Bastok sont vulgaires et grossiers, et devraient être méprisés par tout citoyen honorable de la noble San d'Oria. Je ne souffrirai pas d'être assimilé à des gens comme lui.${prompt}
  9491: |-
    Je vous demande pardon !
    Il n'y a aucune telle animosité entre le peuple de San d'Oria et Bastok ! Présentez vos excuses à Roido immédiatement !${prompt}
  9492: Encore une fois, votre ressemblance avec ma Naphee est troublante.${prompt}
  9493: Vous n'avez pas besoin de faire semblant de m'apprécier, mais je ne peux pas aller à cet endroit seul. C'est beaucoup trop dangereux.${prompt}
  9494: Dangereux !? Y a-t-il des monstres et des choses du genre dans cet endroit ?${prompt}
  9495: Sans aucun doute. Sachant Millechairale, il a caché le sceptre quelque part dans la vaste forêt qui se trouve au-delà du Tombeau du Roi Ranperre.${prompt}
  9496: Alors je suppose que je dois vous accompagner. Mais écoutez bien, Bastoker ! Ne me parlez pas, c'est compris ?${prompt}
  9497: Ah... Pensez-vous pouvoir venir avec moi ? Je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir vraiment faire confiance à cet homme...${prompt}
  9498: Mon frère a caché le sceptre quelque part dans la vaste forêt qui se trouve au-delà du Tombeau du Roi Ranperre. S'il vous plaît, trouvez-le avant qu'il ne retourne là-bas !${prompt}
  9499: Cette dame n'avait rien à voir avec le vol ? Hmm, il semble que mes instincts étaient complètement erronés. Peut-être que mon seul chemin vers la grandeur passe par l'exécution diligente de mes devoirs de garde...${prompt}
  9500: Donc, Millechairale a le Sceptre Royaulais...${prompt}
  9501: "Celui-là était toujours beaucoup trop dévoué ! \nQue vais-je bien pouvoir faire ?${prompt}"
  9502: '...${prompt}'
  9503: Je me suis introduit dans la salle des archives royales et j'ai lu les documents qui me concernaient. Ce que Roido a dit était vrai.${prompt}
  9504: Il semblerait qu'après l'incident... je suis destiné à mourir.${prompt}
  9505: Quoi... ?${prompt}
  9506: Ma famille, la famille Caphieux, a une lignée qui remonte à la fondation du Royaume. C'est pourquoi j'ai été choisi comme émissaire pour rencontrer le prince Fellenant. On m'avait confié le Sceptre Royaulais et le message de l'abdication du roi...${prompt}
  9507: Tout cela n'était qu'une mascarade. Ma véritable mission était d'attendre le moment opportun pour assassiner le prince.${prompt}
  9508: À cet instant... ou ce qui serait cet instant dans le passé, les Cerfs cardinaux devraient se diriger vers la capitale, portant le Sceptre Royaulais. L'un d'eux devrait sûrement accomplir l'assassinat à ma place.${prompt}
  9509: Dis-moi, aventurier ! Que diable s'est-il passé dans le monde de mon époque ? Pourquoi dois-je désobéir aux ordres de mon roi et mettre ma vie en danger pour protéger le prince Fellenant ?${prompt}
  9510: |-
    Phillone !
    Les Chevaliers du Temple ont retrouvé la trace de Millechairale !${prompt}
  9511: '!!!${prompt}'
  9512: Ils ne l'ont pas encore attrapé, mais vous pouvez parier qu'il se dirige vers les Grottes d'Ordelle pour accomplir son serment.${prompt}
  9513: Pourquoi ferait-il ça...? Il marche droit dans leur piège !${prompt}
  9514: S'il vous plaît, aidez-moi encore une fois ! La vie de Millechairale en dépend !${prompt}
  9515: Non, je ne pense pas le faire.${prompt}
  9516: Quoi ?${prompt}
  9517: Pourquoi devrais-je écouter les supplications d'un Bastokien ?${prompt}
  9518: Juste un instant, monsieur ! Êtes-vous en train d'insulter encore mon mari...?${prompt}
  9519: Vijartal, pourquoi détestez-vous tant les Bastokiens ?${prompt}
  9520: Mon père a été tué par des Bastokiens et leurs tactiques sournoises lors de la Seconde Bataille de Konschtat ! Et mon frère aîné est revenu de sa tentative de vengeance en tant que cadavre mutilé !${prompt}
  9521: Bastok est l'ennemi juré de San d'Oria ! Cette République est responsable de la mort de tous ceux que j'aimais !${prompt}
  9522: "Vous dites que ce héros souhaitait la paix entre nos nations !? Ridicule ! \nJe...Vijartal Caphieux préférerais mourir plutôt que d'aider Bastok...${prompt}"
  9523: Pensez-vous que c'était différent pour les gens de Bastok !?${prompt}
  9524: Je ne... ?${prompt}
  9525: Jusqu'à il y a quelques décennies à peine, les nations de San d'Oria et de Bastok avaient mené d'innombrables batailles pour des terres, des ressources et des religions.${prompt}
  9526: Les San d'Oriens et les Bastokiens ont tous deux perdu des amis et de la famille. Beaucoup ont perdu des êtres chers...${prompt}
  9527: '...${prompt}'
  9528: Ne trouvez-vous pas cela étrange ? Nous sommes tous les enfants d'Altana, et pourtant il y a hostilité et conflit entre nous...${prompt}
  9529: Ce que nous devrions vraiment mépriser, c'est la guerre elle-même, pas les personnes qui sont entraînées dans ses flammes. Je remercie Altana du fond de mon âme que nous vivions dans une époque où la guerre entre les peuples de Vana'diel est chose du passé.${prompt}
  9530: Nous devons partir maintenant si nous voulons sauver Millechairale. Je ne sais pas combien de temps il nous reste.${prompt}
  9531: Je vais avec vous !${prompt}
  9532: Phillone, je veux que vous restiez ici. Si les Chevaliers du Temple décident d'envoyer des renforts, essayez de les retarder de toutes les manières possibles.${prompt}
  9533: Je ferai de mon mieux.${prompt}
  9534: Je pars en avant. Rejoignez-moi à l'entrée des Grottes d'Ordelle dès que possible. Si ces soldats le rattrapent...${prompt}
  9535: S'il vous plaît, sortez mon frère de là en sécurité !${prompt}
  9536: Vous êtes une femme inhabituelle.${prompt}
  9537: Pardon ?${prompt}
  9538: "Le nom de ma dame, celle à qui vous ressemblez tant, est Naphee. \nElle m'a un jour posé une question :${prompt}"
  9539: Pourquoi les habitants de San d'Oria et de Bastok doivent-ils se détester alors que nous sommes tous les enfants d'Altana ?${prompt}
  9540: L'année dernière, nous avons quitté Bastok pour nous installer ici dans la capitale. Les deux nations ne sont pas si différentes, vous savez. Tous les peuples ont les mêmes espoirs, les mêmes rêves...${prompt}
  9541: Il y avait ceux qui voyaient les Elvaans comme un ennemi détesté, mais il y avait aussi des âmes gentilles et attentionnées comme Roido, qui me traitaient comme une personne...${prompt}
  9542: Cela prendra du temps, mais je crois que si nous continuons à abattre les barrières de préjugés et d'ignorance qui nous séparent, nous finirons par nous comprendre.${prompt}
  9543: Vous aussi, Vijartal, pouvez trouver la paix... tout comme Roido et moi.${prompt}
  9544: Pourquoi ce destin... Si seulement notre ancêtre n'avait pas laissé sa demande pour que le Sceptre Royaulais soit apporté aux Grottes d'Ordelle... ! Altana, protège ma famille du mal !${prompt}
  9545: Ce n'est pas possible ! Millechairale a été capturé !?${prompt}
  9546: Je suis désolé. Je vous ai déçu...${prompt}
  9547: Monarlais Halver ?${prompt}
  9548: Roido ! Phillone !${prompt}
  9549: Millechairale ! Pourquoi vous ont-ils amené ici !?${prompt}
  9550: C'est un miracle ! Cet homme qui se faisait appeler Vijartal était en fait le héros légendaire !${prompt}
  9551: Une lettre scellée avec des ordres à ouvrir cette année a été transmise par la famille royale. C'est un document écrit par le Prince Fellenant, l'homme sauvé par Vijartal Caphieux.${prompt}
  9552: Ce document parle de votre famille.${prompt}
  9553: Incroyable !${prompt}
  9554: Selon cette lettre, Millechairale Caphieux volerait le Sceptre Royaulais. Cependant, lui et ceux qui l'accompagnaient ne doivent être accusés d'aucun crime, comme demandé par Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}
  9555: Il était écrit que ces personnes maintiendraient les bonnes relations entre notre royaume et Bastok, et joueraient un rôle vital dans l'avenir de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9556: '!!!${prompt}'
  9557: C'est un document des plus inhabituels. Mais la volonté du Prince Fellenant, un ancêtre direct de l'actuelle famille royale d'Oraguille, est incontestable.${prompt}
  9558: Pendant que nous y sommes, êtes-vous au courant de la légende qui entoure la Pierre Errante ?${prompt}
  9559: Vijartal Caphieux a convaincu Fellenant de rouvrir la ville après avoir empêché l'assassinat du prince. On dit qu'à ce moment-là, le Prince Fellenant a regardé dans la Pierre Errante et a entrevu un aperçu du futur.${prompt}
  9560: Il n'est pas exactement certain quelle vision le prince a vue. Seulement que les nations autrefois en guerre s'uniraient dans un esprit de coopération. Après avoir vu ce rêve du futur, le Prince Fellenant s'est rendu à son frère, le roi.${prompt}
  9561: Cette reddition était sous la condition que les Chevaliers du Temple, qui avaient agi sous les ordres du prince pour prendre le contrôle de la capitale, soient exemptés de toute responsabilité. De plus, un traité appelant à la cessation des hostilités avec Bastok devait être ratifié.${prompt}
  9562: Et qu'est-il advenu de Vijartal Caphieux ? Eh bien, c'est une histoire que tout enfant du Royaume connaît. Il a été mortellement empoisonné en luttant avec l'assassin qui voulait tuer le prince...${prompt}
  9563: Le plus étrange est que la véritable tombe de Vijartal n'a jamais été retrouvée. Avec les actes qu'il a accomplis, je suis sûr qu'il a été enterré dans une tombe magnifiquement resplendissante, cependant.${prompt}
  9564: Quoi qu'il en soit, après sa reddition, le Prince Fellenant a été emprisonné dans l'oubliette. Il était officiel que le sang de la famille royale ne devait pas être versé, quel que soit le crime.${prompt}
  9565: Trois ans après son emprisonnement, le prince a réussi à s'échapper. Comme nous le savons tous, cela a déclenché le début de la guerre civile acharnée qui a marqué cent ans de l'histoire de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9566: Ce conflit interne a persisté jusqu'à ce que le Roi Dragon, Ranperre, prenne le trône et unifie de nouveau le peuple Elvaan. Dans ses veines coulait le même sang que celui du Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  9567: Je dois m'excuser. Ce n'était pas mon intention de donner une leçon d'histoire aussi longue.${prompt}
  9568: Au contraire, j'étais assez surpris d'apprendre que la lignée de Vijartal Caphieux prospérait encore dans la capitale.${prompt}
  9569: Jusqu'à récemment, nous résidions dans la ville de Bastok.${prompt}
  9570: À Bastok ?${prompt}
  9571: Oui, notre famille y est depuis plusieurs générations...${prompt}
  9572: Hmm... En y repensant, il existe des écrits qui parlent d'un chevalier ayant organisé l'évasion du Prince Fellenant, et qui plus tard s'est réfugié à Bastok.${prompt}
  9573: Apparemment, ce chevalier signait son nom comme étant le “Trait d'Obsidienne”.${prompt}
  9574: Sauriez-vous quelque chose à ce sujet ?${prompt}
  9575: En fait, peut-être vaudrait-il mieux ne pas aborder ce sujet. Si je commençais à raconter l'histoire complexe de notre royaume, la lune pourrait accomplir son cycle et je n'aurais encore qu'égratigné la surface.${prompt}
  9576: Que dites-vous ? Vous avez rencontré le héros de cette histoire ? Hahaha, maintenant vous vous moquez de moi !${prompt}
  9577: |-
    Il est temps que je retourne à mes devoirs.
    Phillone. Ils seront libérés en temps voulu, mais pendant un moment, la présence de Roido et Millechairale sera requise au château.${prompt}
  9578: Il y a trop de détails dans cette affaire qui restent flous pour moi. J'aimerais écouter une explication complète de ces événements, ainsi qu'en savoir plus sur vos ancêtres...${prompt}
  9579: Ne t'inquiète pas pour nous, chère sœur. Je suis sûr que nous reviendrons avant que tu ne t'en rendes compte.${prompt}
  9580: Oui, et ensuite nous pourrons continuer notre vie paisible ici, dans cette maison de Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}
  9581: J'attends votre retour.${prompt}
  9582: "Cet homme était-il vraiment notre... \nNon, ce n'est pas possible. \nMaintenant, je dois m'habituer à cette maison silencieuse sans ces deux pour mettre de l'animation !${prompt}"
  9583: Des intrus !${prompt}
  9584: '... C’est quelque chose que j’ai toujours voulu dire, mais dire "rien à signaler" jour après jour est probablement le mieux, tout bien considéré. Pourtant, cela doit être excitant de vivre à la même époque que Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}'
  9585: Tu dis avoir rencontré Louverance ? Comment était le jeune homme ?${prompt}
  9586: |-
    Je vois... Il visite rarement ces jours-ci.
    Je suis tellement inquiète. Si quelque chose lui arrivait, mon défunt mari serait dévasté.${prompt}
  9587: |-
    Hm ?
    L'Expédition Multinationale ? Pourquoi, je n'ai pas entendu ce nom depuis trente ans...${prompt}
  9588: |-
    Oui, je m'en souviens comme si c'était hier...
    À cette époque, mon mari et moi vivions dans un manoir juste à l'extérieur du village de La Vaule, bien que je pense que la région s'appelle maintenant Davoi.${prompt}
  9589: Il y avait un monastère au centre du village. Quand Muchavatte, le papsque de l'époque, visitait le monastère, il s'arrêtait souvent chez nous.${prompt}
  9590: Je me rappelle que Sa Sainteté mentionnait que l'expédition était appelée pour vérifier certaines informations fournies par le gouvernement bastokien.${prompt}
  9591: À cette époque, les Humes affirmaient qu'il y avait une force puissante cachée profondément dans les Terres Interdites du Nord.${prompt}
  9592: Bien sûr, le papsque ne pouvait pas entièrement croire les histoires de ces Bastokiens rusés.${prompt}
  9593: Cependant, c'est mon mari qui a suggéré que cette force puissante pourrait être les Portes du Paradis...${prompt}
  9594: Dame Hinaree ! Voulez-vous dire que la cathédrale avait localisé les portes ?${prompt}
  9595: Pourquoi, c'est... !${prompt}
  9596: Oh, comment notre petite invitée de Tavnazia a grandi ! Et regarde comme tu es devenue belle !${prompt}
  9597: Puis-je supposer que cet aventurier est de vos connaissances ?${prompt}
  9598: Je m'excuse pour mon intrusion, Dame Hinaree. Quand j'ai entendu parler des Portes du Paradis, je n'ai pas pu me contrôler...${prompt}
  9599: Tout va bien, mon enfant. Je suis juste tellement bouleversée. Je n'aurais jamais imaginé que nous nous reverrions. Cela fait quoi, vingt ans ?${prompt}
  9600: Oui. Et je dois une fois de plus exprimer mes plus grands remerciements pour la gentillesse que vous m'avez montrée à l'époque.${prompt}
  9601: Oh, une telle démonstration d'humilité n'est pas nécessaire. Selon Mildaurion C Giloumet, vous étiez une invitée très spéciale.${prompt}
  9602: Je peux encore entendre ses mots, “Veuillez accueillir dans votre maison la ménestrelle de renommée mondiale, Dame Ulmia.”${prompt}
  9603: |-
    <Rire>
    Tu étais encore si jeune, je me demandais comment et quand tu étais devenue “de renommée mondiale.” C'est alors que tu m'as dit que tu voyageais avec le cardinal car tu souhaitais voir Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9604: Encore une fois, je m'excuse...${prompt}
  9605: |-
    Oui, je m'en souviens maintenant...
    N'y avait-il pas une autre jeune fille avec toi ?${prompt}
  9606: '...${prompt}'
  9607: Oh, je suis désolée. Je ne réfléchissais pas. Je n'avais pas réalisé qu'elle...${prompt}
  9608: Non, ça va. Elle est toujours en vie. Elle a réussi à échapper aux flammes de la guerre avec moi.${prompt}
  9609: Oh, c'est si réconfortant d'entendre qu'un autre enfant de Vana'diel a été béni par la lumière de la Déesse de l'Aube.${prompt}
  9610: Oui, les choses étaient bien meilleures il y a trente ans, quand Muchavatte et Mildaurion étaient encore avec nous...${prompt}
  9611: Ils s'asseyaient dans le bureau avec mon mari et discutaient jusqu'au petit matin de l'existence des Portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  9612: Dame Hinaree, serait-ce trop demander de savoir ce que vous savez des portes ?${prompt}
  9613: La raison pour laquelle j'ai voyagé ici depuis Tavnazia est de m'informer auprès de la cathédrale sur le sujet.${prompt}
  9614: '...${prompt}'
  9615: L'explication donnée aux masses était plus vague et trompeuse que n'importe lequel de mes cantiques.${prompt}
  9616: J'ai entendu des histoires disant que l'explication était un message d'Altana, donné au papsque sur son lit de mort. Cependant, j'ai aussi entendu beaucoup de choses qui contredisent cela.${prompt}
  9617: S'il vous plaît. Dites-moi s'il y a plus dans cette histoire.${prompt}
  9618: Ulmia, le Paradis est un endroit magnifique—un lieu splendide sans mort ni peur.${prompt}
  9619: Quand mon village a été attaqué par les Orcs, les mains sanglantes du destin m'ont arraché mon mari. La foi en le Paradis que le papsque m'a instillée—c'est ce qui m'a sauvé la vie.${prompt}
  9620: Tu chantes les mots du cœur, Ulmia. Tu devrais savoir que la vérité n'est pas toujours ce qui nous sauve.${prompt}
  9621: Mais si c'est la seule chose qui offre le salut, alors il n'y a rien de plus important.${prompt}
  9622: Le cardinal Mildaurion m'a dit que le courage de faire face à la vérité est ce qui nous sauvera en fin de compte.${prompt}
  9623: Le cardinal a dit cela...?${prompt}
  9624: |-
    Très bien...
    Il y a une chose que Sa Sainteté a mentionnée lorsque je lui ai rendu visite après qu'il soit tombé malade.${prompt}
  9625: “J'ai été forcé d'abandonner la vérité.”${prompt}
  9626: Abandonner... la vérité ?${prompt}
  9627: Le regard sur son visage quand il m'a dit cela était celui d'un homme qui se tenait aux portes de l'au-delà. Je n'avais pas le courage de lui demander ce qu'il voulait dire par ses mots.${prompt}
  9628: '...${prompt}'
  9629: Je ne peux savoir si la “vérité” dont le papsque parlait avait une quelconque relation avec les Portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  9630: Cependant, ce n'était pas longtemps après cette rencontre que le cardinal Mildaurion a révoqué sa propre noblesse et a disparu du Royaume. Maintenant que j'y pense, cet événement pourrait avoir un lien avec les paroles de Muchavatte.${prompt}
  9631: Le cardinal a révoqué sa noblesse ? Quand cela s'est-il produit ?${prompt}
  9632: Il y a presque vingt ans, bien sûr. Je crois que c'était juste quelques jours après l'attaque surprise des Orcs sur le Marquisat. Ne le savais-tu pas ?${prompt}
  9633: Non, je ne le savais pas. Je pensais que le cardinal Mildaurion était une victime de l'assaut. La dernière fois que je l'ai vue, elle se tenait à Tavnazia alors qu'elle s'effondrait et brûlait.${prompt}
  9634: Il semble que la lumière d'Altana ait également béni le cardinal.${prompt}
  9635: |-
    Oui... C'est vrai...
    Dame Hinaree, savez-vous où elle est allée après avoir révoqué sa noblesse ?${prompt}
  9636: Cela, je ne le sais pas. Cependant, j'ai entendu dire que la cathédrale a envoyé un chevalier pour enquêter sur son emplacement.${prompt}
  9637: Ce chevalier s'appelle Louverance--l'un des descendants directs des anciens Chevaliers Mistalle. Je dis “anciens” parce que la famille a été dépouillée de sa royauté il y a des années. On dit que Louverance lui-même était autrefois membre des Chevaliers Royaux.${prompt}
  9638: Abandonner la vérité...${prompt}
  9639: Cette vérité est-elle liée d'une manière ou d'une autre aux Portes du Paradis, ou pourrait-il s'agir d'autre chose ? La vérité de l'expédition, peut-être ?${prompt}
  9640: |-
    Et le cardinal Mildaurion... Je n'ai jamais su qu'elle était encore en vie.
    Mais si c'est vrai, pourquoi n'est-elle pas retournée à Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  9641: Nous a-t-elle oubliés...moi ?${prompt}
  9642: Je me souviens que Sa Sainteté avait mentionné que l'expédition avait été appelée pour vérifier certaines informations apportées par le gouvernement bastokien.${prompt}
  9643: |-
    Cependant, vous pourriez essayer de vous renseigner à Windurst.
    Cette affaire est encore entourée d'incertitudes...${prompt}
  9644: Mais en mettant de côté ces pensées troublantes, la réunion d'aujourd'hui a été une surprise des plus agréables. Nous devons remercier la douce Altana pour cette merveilleuse bénédiction.${prompt}
  9645: Hm? Vous cherchez Louverance N Mistalle?${prompt}
  9646: Cela pourrait être plus difficile que vous ne l'imaginez. Cependant, si vous êtes bénis par la lumière d'Altana, rien n'est impossible.${prompt}
  9647: |-
    Ah, vous êtes l'aventurier qui est passé avant.
    Avez-vous trouvé Prishe par hasard ?${prompt}
  9648: |-
    Je vois...
    J'ai entendu parler de ce qui s'est passé par Ulmia.${prompt}
  9649: Il est affligeant d'entendre que Prishe, aussi malade qu'elle soit, est impliquée dans tout cela. Et maintenant, Ulmia dit qu'elle a disparu et que le gouvernement de Jeuno a émis un mandat pour sa capture.${prompt}
  9650: ${name-player}, vous connaissez Prishe, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9651: Bien que je ne l'aie rencontrée qu'une seule fois il y a longtemps, je ne peux pas croire qu'elle puisse faire les choses dont le duché l'accuse.${prompt}
  9652: Ce n'est peut-être qu'une inquiétude inutile, mais il y a une chose qui me trouble.${prompt}
  9653: Lorsque le cardinal Mildaurion a amené son disciple, Prishe, à notre résidence, mon mari m'a dit de me méfier d'elle...${prompt}
  9654: Quand j'ai demandé pourquoi, il a dit que sa naissance était un grand malheur, et qu'en temps voulu elle commettrait un grand crime contre Vana'diel et ses enfants--c'était son destin.${prompt}
  9655: Et c'était tout ce qu'il dirait...${prompt}
  9656: Oh, ne vous inquiétez pas, ${name-player}. J'ai abandonné tout intérêt personnel et j'ai promis mes services à la Déesse de l'Aube.${prompt}
  9657: Je ne me soucie pas de savoir si quelqu'un a commis des crimes dans le passé. Je ne peux pas tourner le dos à quelqu'un qui implore de l'aide.${prompt}
  9658: J'ai offert mon aide à Ulmia dans son moment de besoin. J'ai également suggéré qu'elle reste ici.${prompt}
  9659: S'il vous plaît, seriez-vous assez aimable pour lui transmettre un message important ?${prompt}
  9660: Il y a quelques instants, un haut prêtre de la cathédrale, Chasalvige, est passé. Il a demandé à parler à Ulmia.${prompt}
  9661: Je crois qu'elle est quelque part près du port. Je vous serais extrêmement reconnaissante de la trouver et de lui dire de visiter la cathédrale.${prompt}
  9662: Ulmia se rend tous les jours au port pour demander aux voyageurs s'ils savent quelque chose de Prishe.${prompt}
  9663: Seriez-vous assez aimable pour la trouver et lui dire de rendre visite au haut prêtre Chasalvige à la cathédrale ?${prompt}

  9719: Les règles de base de Brenner sont les suivantes :${prompt}
  9720: Tout d'abord, les participants se divisent en deux équipes. Le camp de chaque côté contient le même nombre de "Flammen-Brenner".${prompt}
  9721: Au début du match, la moitié des Flammen-Brenner de chaque côté seront enflammées avec "Flamme", tandis que l'autre moitié restera éteinte.${prompt}
  9722: Les participants peuvent saisir une Flamme du Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse et la transporter autour de l'île.${prompt}
  9723: Le but est de voler la Flamme de votre adversaire et de l'utiliser pour allumer les Flammen-Brenner de votre côté.${prompt}
  9724: L'équipe qui réussit à allumer tous ses Flammen-Brenner sera déclarée gagnante après un laps de temps spécifié.${prompt}
  9725: Si aucune des équipes n'est victorieuse avant la fin du match, le résultat sera jugé en fonction du score. La section "score du match" du règlement contient plus d'informations à ce sujet.${prompt}
  9726: Brenner est significativement divisé en matches publics et privés. Les matches officiels sont tenus périodiquement selon le niveau et offrent une participation générale.${prompt}
  9727: Vous ne pouvez pas réserver l'île lorsqu'un match officiel est en cours.${prompt}
  9728: Aucun objet n'est nécessaire pour participer, mais des frais minimes seront prélevés. Vous ne pourrez pas participer si votre niveau est trop bas.${prompt}
  9729: 'Le résultat du match sera enregistré sauf si le nombre de participants ne dépasse pas ${number: 0} membres, ou s’il y a moins de ${number: 1} membres dans un match où les nombres des deux côtés diffèrent. Dans de tels cas, le jeu sera considéré comme un match d’entraînement et ne sera pas enregistré.${prompt}'
  9730: 'Les matches privés nécessitent une réservation et la participation peut être limitée. Le ${color: 5}Maître de cérémonie${color: 1} (MC) peut librement ajuster les règles et contrôler le déroulement du match.${prompt}'
  9731: “LS Liga” est une forme de match privé. Vous pouvez en apprendre plus sur LS Liga en parlant à un Maréchal.${prompt}
  9732: Un Flammen-Brenner est un dispositif qui contient une Flamme. Le Flammen-Brenner est couvert par une grille qui s'ouvrira après avoir subi une certaine quantité de dégâts, exposant la Flamme.${prompt}
  9733: Les participants doivent profiter de cette occasion pour saisir la Flamme avant que la grille ne se referme. Une fois la grille fermée, le Flammen-Brenner commencera à récupérer des dégâts qu'il a subis.${prompt}
  9734: Si vous parvenez à ouvrir le Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse et à capturer leur Flamme, vous devez vous dépêcher d'allumer l'un des Flammen-Brenner de votre côté.${prompt}
  9735: Après un certain laps de temps, la Flamme s'éteindra et le Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse sera rallumé.${prompt}
  9736: Lorsque vous êtes en possession d'une Flamme, vous ne pouvez pas accélérer votre rythme en utilisant des capacités spéciales.${prompt}
  9737: Dans le cas où aucune des équipes ne remplit les conditions de la victoire, le résultat du match sera évalué en fonction du score.${prompt}
  9738: Dix points sont attribués à chaque équipe pour chaque Flammen-Brenner allumé, tandis qu'un point est attribué chaque fois qu'une Flamme est capturée, utilisée pour allumer un Flammen-Brenner, ou récupérée d'un adversaire. Un point est également attribué pour la protection du Flammen-Brenner pendant une certaine période.${prompt}
  9739: 'Comme pour Ballista, la capacité ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) peut être utilisée lors de la pratique de Brenner. Les participants peuvent utiliser cette capacité pour extraire des ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} et des objets temporaires.${prompt}'
  9740: 'Cependant, contrairement aux Petras de Ballista, les Petras de Brenner n’ont aucun effet sur le score du match. Vous pouvez ${color: 5}échanger${color: 1} un Petra à un Héraut pour récupérer vos PV et PM sans frais en TP.${prompt}'
  9741: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} ne peut pas être utilisé lorsque vous transportez un Petra. De plus, veuillez noter que la capacité ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ne peut pas être utilisée dans Brenner.${prompt}'
  9742: Les Petras seront perdus en cas de KO, mais peuvent être conservés d'un match à l'autre.${prompt}
  9743: 'La capacité ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) peut être utilisée pour augmenter la vitesse du joueur lorsqu’il n’est pas en possession d’une Flamme ou de Petras.${prompt}'
  9744: En cas de KO, vous serez ramené au camp de votre équipe. Cependant, la récupération prendra plus de temps si vous tombez souvent au combat.${prompt}
  9745: En d'autres termes, vous recevrez une pénalité si vous tombez immédiatement après avoir récupéré d'un KO. De plus, votre TP sera réduit à zéro et vous perdrez tous les Petras que vous possédez.${prompt}
  9746: Je suis désolé. Je n'écoutais pas. Pourriez-vous recommencer depuis le début ?${prompt}
  9747: Vous dites que vos voyages vous ont emmené dans les prairies balayées par le vent de Tavnazia. Bien des lunes ont passé depuis que ce nom est tombé à mes oreilles.${prompt}
  9748: |-
    Cependant, avec votre arrivée, des souvenirs oubliés de la Marquisate ont surgi des recoins de mon esprit, tout comme l'eau claire de la montagne jaillit d'une source.
    Oui, je me souviens quand les rues étaient remplies de produits et de marchandises transportés par d'innombrables marchands de l'archipel lointain.${prompt}
  9749: 'Pourquoi, quand Lady Femitte était encore enfant, j’utilisais souvent ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} quand je préparais son dîner. Oh, comme elle adorait son arôme savoureux.${prompt}'
  9750: Je me demande si l'épice pousse toujours parmi les arbres du Cape Riverne...${prompt}
  9751: Quoi ? Des forces d'un autre monde ont déchiré les champs tranquilles, laissant le cap en ruines totales ? Mon Dieu, alors je ne pourrais pas vous demander de risquer votre vie pour quelque chose d'aussi simple qu'une herbe.${prompt}
  9752: 'Si, par quelque merveilleux miracle, vous vous retrouvez en possession d’un brin de ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, alors je serais très heureuse de préparer à nouveau à Lady Femitte des plats tavnaziens authentiques.${prompt}'
  9753: 'Mon Dieu, c’est du ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} ! Je n’aurais jamais imaginé que je serais à nouveau bénie de l’opportunité de garnir mes plats avec cette épice succulente.${prompt}'

    Comme je ne suis qu'une simple servante, je n'ai que peu à vous offrir en retour.
    Veuillez accepter ceci comme un témoignage de ma gratitude.${prompt}
  9755: Un jeune et talentueux marchand de Tavnazia venait souvent au manoir et me donnait ces épices avant de se rendre à la cathédrale pour faire des affaires avec les prêtres. Mais c'était il y a longtemps...${prompt}
  9756: Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Rouva ? Je ne vous ai pas vue aussi ravie depuis des lustres.${prompt}
  9757: 'Oui, ma dame. Cet excellent aventurier nous a apporté un brin de ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}!${prompt}'
  9758: Non, ce que je voulais dire, c'est que vous aviez l'air terriblement ravie lorsque vous parliez de ce jeune marchand. Peut-être aviez-vous un faible pour ce jeune homme exotique venu de loin ?${prompt}
  9759: "Dame Femitte ! Je... je...${prompt} \nIl y a longtemps, j'ai purifié mon esprit de telles pensées impures.${prompt} "
  9760: Bien qu'à un moment donné, mon cœur ait pu battre plus vite au son des pas du marchand s'approchant de la porte du manoir, j'ai repoussé ces sentiments après avoir entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles il aurait épousé l'une des théologiennes de la cathédrale et serait retourné à Tavnazia. Ce serait un péché pour moi de désirer quelqu'un lié à un autre.${prompt}
  9761: "Mais...${prompt} \nJe ne peux qu'espérer qu'il ait échappé aux flammes de la guerre qui ont traversé son pays il y a vingt ans...${prompt} "
  9762: Que la Déesse ait pitié du jeune Despachiaire...${prompt}
  9763: Grâce à votre acte de gentillesse désintéressé, j'ai pu offrir à ma dame un goût de son enfance.${prompt}
  9764: Mon nom est Sobane, et mon mari est le chef de cuisine de la famille royale.${prompt}
  9765: Tout récemment, il m'a annoncé une nouvelle des plus troublantes. C'est pourquoi j'ai été poussée à demander l'aide d'un aventurier...${prompt}

  9769: Si vous décidez d'accéder à ma demande, seriez-vous prêt à prêter un serment de sang ?${prompt}

    J'ai été stupide de m'attendre à ce qu'un aventurier accepte un accord aussi contraignant. Je trouverai un autre moyen...${prompt}
  9775: 'En guise de preuve de votre serment, je vous demande d’apporter ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9776: |-
    Merci, aventurier.
    J'accepte ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} comme preuve de votre parole.${prompt}
  9777: |-
    Je vous demande une fois de plus de ne souffler mot de cela à quiconque.
    Maintenant, passons aux choses sérieuses.${prompt}
  9778: Il y a quelques jours, le comte Varonbiriaux M Teulomme a été reçu en audience par le royaulais.${prompt}
  9779: |-
    Connaissez-vous le comte Teulomme ?
    Il réside dans un manoir construit dans le territoire de Carpenters' Landing.${prompt}
  9780: Il y a trente ans, ces terres appartenaient aux Chevaliers Mistalle.${prompt}
  9781: Cependant, le chef de famille, Francmage M Mistalle, a perdu la vie dans des circonstances mystérieuses...${prompt}
  9782: Sa mort inexplicable a été un terrible coup pour les chevaliers.${prompt}
  9783: Leservieus M Mistalle, fils unique de Francmage et membre des Chevaliers royaux, est emporté dans un tourbillon de rage et de désespoir.${prompt}
  9784: |-
    Il s'est disputé avec Lord Epuliphont, un Templier avec qui il n'entretenait pas de bonnes relations.
    Enragé par les conjectures diffamatoires sur le sort de son père, Leservieus a défié Epuliphont en duel à mort.${prompt}
  9785: Comme cela a toujours été le cas à San d'Oria, les duels sont strictement interdits par la loi.${prompt}
  9786: Lorsque la nouvelle de leur combat est parvenue à la cour royale, les deux familles ont été déchues de leurs titres, et la femme de Leservieus est retournée à Selbina avec son enfant en bas âge.${prompt}
  9787: Trente ans se sont écoulés depuis ce temps.${prompt}
  9788: Le fils né de Leservieus et de sa femme est devenu un magnifique chevalier.${prompt}
  9789: Il s'est lancé dans un voyage pour racheter le nom de sa famille.${prompt}
  9790: Lorsque le comte Teulomme en a appris davantage, il a ordonné à ses vassaux de rechercher cet héritier des Chevaliers Mistalle.${prompt}
  9791: Le comte, sous prétexte de vouloir connaître la vérité sur ce qui s'est passé il y a trente ans, propose d'aider le chevalier dans son entreprise...${prompt}
  9792: Cependant, le cuisinier du comte pense que Teulomme est plus préoccupé par le fait de perdre ses terres au profit de leur propriétaire légitime.
  9793: |-
    Ne prenez pas les paroles d'un cuisinier à la légère.
    Beaucoup d'informations parviennent à un homme qui prépare les repas pour un foyer.${prompt}
  9794: Si le comte Teulomme cherche vraiment à nuire à l'héritier des Chevaliers de Mistalle, nous avons le devoir de le mettre en garde contre le danger.${prompt}
  9795: Je suis sûr qu'un aventurier de votre calibre sera capable de localiser cet homme avant qu'il ne se produise quelque chose de fâcheux.${prompt}
  9796: Veuillez trouver le chevalier de Mistalle. Il doit être informé de la menace qui pèse sur sa vie.${prompt}
  9797: Le comte Teulomme cherche-t-il vraiment le chevalier de Mistalle pour lui nuire ?${prompt}
  9798: Je vous demande de trouver ce chevalier et de le mettre en garde contre le danger qui le menace.${prompt}
  9799: Je ne sais pas où il réside actuellement...${prompt}
  9800: Mais il est possible que sa mère, la dame Leffine, habite encore dans la ville de Selbina.${prompt}
  9801: La Bande d'Atarefaunet !?${prompt}
  9802: C'est en effet un nom effrayant.${prompt}
  9803: Ce groupe de brigands odieux terrorisait le continent de Quon quand j'étais enfant.${prompt}
  9804: Ils rôdaient sur les routes commerciales entre San d'Oria, Bastok, Jeuno et Tavnazia, et attaquaient tous les marchands qu'ils rencontraient.${prompt}
  9805: |-
    Ils n'avaient aucune pitié pour les hommes, les femmes ou les enfants, et utilisaient les biens et les informations obtenus pour menacer et faire chanter d'autres personnes.
    Ils étaient bien pires qu'une simple bande de voleurs.${prompt}
  9806: Mais vers la fin de la Grande Guerre, leur chef, Atarefaunet, a finalement été capturé par des chasseurs de primes.${prompt}
  9807: Atarefaunet a été amené ici, à San d'Oria, et exécuté peu de temps après.${prompt}
  9808: Les membres restants de la bande se sont dispersés aux quatre coins de Vana'diel et se cachent encore aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  9809: Est-il possible que le comte Teulomme ait employé des membres de la Bande d'Atarefaunet ?${prompt}
  9810: Et ces bandits recherchent le fils de la dame Leffine, Louverance...${prompt}
  9811: |-
    Les choses sont bien pires que je ne le craignais.
    Apprendre l'implication de la Bande d'Atarefaunet me remplit de crainte.${prompt}
  9812: |-
    Voici votre récompense.
    Je vous en prie, aventurier, ne soufflez mot de cela à personne.${prompt}
  9813: |-
    Restez sur vos gardes, ${name-player}.
    Et s'il vous plaît, ne soufflez mot de cela à personne.${prompt}
  9814: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Votre timing est des plus fortunés.${prompt}
  9815: Mon mari souhaite discuter avec vous.${prompt}
  9816: Êtes-vous l'aventurier qui a réalisé la demande de ma femme ?${prompt}
  9817: Elle semble vous estimer beaucoup, mais avez-vous réellement les compétences nécessaires pour répondre à cette confiance ?${prompt}
  9818: Vous feriez bien de ne pas signer un serment de sang si légèrement.${prompt}
  9819: Le serment de sang signé par les familles de Mistalle et de Revemel servait de preuve de leur duel lorsque l'affaire a été portée devant la cour royale.${prompt}
  9820: Les deux familles ont été sévèrement punies pour leurs actions.${prompt}
  9821: Cette affaire ne me concerne pas personnellement. Cependant, la mère de ma femme, qui travaillait pour la famille Revemel, a été accusée d'avoir remis ce serment.${prompt}
  9822: Ma mère est innocente de cette accusation, mais ses supplications sont restées lettre morte.${prompt}
  9823: Maintenant, peut-être comprenez-vous pourquoi Sobane est si déterminée à découvrir la vérité.${prompt}
  9824: |-
    Bien que je sois le chef de cuisine de la famille royale, je ne suis qu'un simple cuisinier.
    Je n'ai aucun intérêt à élever des chevaliers et à me joindre à la lutte des familles nobles pour le pouvoir.${prompt}
  9825: Quels que soient les accords ou les plans sous-jacents, tout cela appartient au passé.${prompt}
  9826: Il n'y a rien à gagner à fixer une assiette vide une fois le repas terminé.${prompt}
  9827: Je comprends ce que tu veux dire, mon amour.${prompt}
  9828: Cependant, nous devons assumer la responsabilité de l'avenir.${prompt}
  9829: Louverance Mistalle doit être mis en garde contre la menace qui pèse sur sa vie...${prompt}
  9830: Même si vous n'avez jamais rencontré le chevalier en question ?${prompt}
  9831: Selon le chef de la famille Teulomme, le comte est confronté à des menaces venant d'une personne inconnue.${prompt}
  9832: |-
    Pour ce que nous en savons, il pourrait s'agir de ce Louverance que vous cherchez à protéger.
    Le comte Teulomme serait alors bien justifié dans ses efforts pour le retrouver.${prompt}
  9833: Louverance a été élevé dans la ville de Selbina et n'a reçu aucune formation chevaleresque formelle.${prompt}
  9834: Après avoir atteint l'âge adulte, il s'est rendu à San d'Oria avec de grandes perspectives de rejoindre les Chevaliers Royaux. Sa décision de renoncer à cette chance ne témoigne pas en sa faveur.${prompt}
  9835: '...${prompt}'
  9836: Mais ce serait une erreur de le juger uniquement sur ces faits.${prompt}
  9837: C'est pourquoi j'aimerais que vous confirmiez quelque chose pour nous, aventurier.${prompt}
  9838: La personne qui menace le comte Teulomme est-elle vraiment ce Louverance, ou un autre personnage qui s'est éloigné du chemin chevaleresque ?${prompt}
  9839: Apparemment, le comte n'a pas encore répondu à son tourmenteur.${prompt}
  9840: Selon le chef, le criminel aurait dit qu'il peut être contacté par l'un des Tonberries de Carpenters' Landing.${prompt}
  9841: |-
    C'est tout ce que je sais.
    Je dois retourner à mes devoirs au château.
    Sobane, méfie-toi des étrangers.${prompt}
  9842: Oui, cher...${prompt}
  9843: Je me demande si Sir Louverance est celui qui menace réellement le comte Teulomme, comme le suggère mon mari.${prompt}
  9844: Le criminel aurait dit qu'il peut être contacté par l'un des Tonberries de Carpenters' Landing.${prompt}
  9845: |-
    ${name-player}.
    S'il te plaît, aide-moi à découvrir la vérité.${prompt}

    As-tu découvert l'identité de celui qui menace le comte Teulomme ?

  9853: Il est même allé jusqu'à dire que les actions de Louverance ont été responsables de lui avoir sauvé la vie.${prompt}
  9854: Il m'a également promis qu'une lettre serait rédigée et envoyée à Louverance pour le prévenir du danger potentiel provenant du comte Teulomme.${prompt}
  9855: Cela te satisfait-il, Sobane ?${prompt}
  9856: |-
    Oui, je pense que cela devrait suffire.

  9942: Vous voyez, nous prenons ces cartes et les enterrons autour des environs de la ville. Ensuite, les Gobelins sortent et essaient de les trouver. S'ils y parviennent, ils peuvent nous les rapporter et les échanger contre différents prix, kupo.${prompt}
  9943: Cette fois-ci, nous les avons dispersées dans toute la région, pensant que les Gobelins ne pourraient pas couvrir autant de terrain, kupo.${prompt}
  9944: Mais c'était avant que nous apprenions qu'ils avaient leurs propres chocobos !${prompt}
  9945: Ce n'est pas juste, kupo !${prompt}

    Et c'est pourquoi nous avons besoin de votre aide, kupo !
    Pourriez-vous aller sur le terrain et trouver les cartes avant les Gobelins ?${prompt}

    Mais notre discussion dévie encore.

    Quelle belle voix elle avait ! Un talent rare à l'époque, je me souviens.${prompt}
  9957: |-
    Elle était aussi belle de visage que de voix...
    Bien que cela me fasse honte de l'admettre, j'étais plutôt jalouse du couple qu'ils formaient ensemble.${prompt}
  9958: |-
    Despachiaire et sa bien-aimée étaient souvent le sujet de commérages parmi les jeunes femmes.
    Je suis certaine qu'il y en a d'autres qui se souviennent aussi bien du couple que moi.${prompt}
  9959: En fait, l'histoire de la choriste de la cathédrale et du marchand tavnazien est devenue un véritable scandale.${prompt}
  9960: Après avoir emmené son amour à Tavnazia, je crois que cette... attention... a empêché Despachiaire de revenir à San d'Oria...${prompt}

  9962: Je ne suis pas complètement certain(e) de son origine, mais à en juger par sa forme, je dirais qu'il s'agit d'un artefact de la cathédrale de San d'Oria.${prompt}

  9964: Peut-être qu'en le polissant avec les spores des champignons lumineux trouvés près du Débarcadère des Charpentiers, les lettres deviendront suffisamment claires pour être lues...${prompt}
  9965: |-
    Les connaissances triviales d'une femme âgée...
    Les jeunes de nos jours sont si prompts à se débarrasser de tout ce qui montre des signes d'usure...${prompt}
  9966: Si jamais vous vous trouvez à proximité du Débarcadère des Charpentiers, cherchez un des champignons dont j'ai parlé.${prompt}
  9967: |-
    Je pourrais peut-être vous en dire plus une fois que l'inscription sera lisible.
    D'ici là, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9968: |-
    Je vois que vous avez trouvé le chemin du Débarcadère des Charpentiers.
    Et vous avez fait un excellent travail avec le ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  9969: |-
    C'est exactement ce que je supposais...
    C'est un amulette fabriquée par la cathédrale de San d'Oria et gravée des paroles d'un saint célèbre.${prompt}
  9970: |-
    Ah oui, les lettres sont maintenant légèrement lisibles. Bien que je doute qu'elles soient remarquées par quelqu'un qui n'en connaît pas l'existence...
    L'inscription dit :${prompt}
  9971: “Les regrets ne tourmentent pas un cœur rempli de foi.”${prompt}
  9972: |-
    J'ai déjà entendu ces mots à la cathédrale.
    Un “cœur rempli de foi” faisait référence à la croyance en la Déesse, cependant...${prompt}
  9973: Oui, je suis sûr(e) que le propriétaire de cet amulette appliquait ces mots à plus que des questions religieuses.${prompt}
  9974: |-
    Oh, mon Dieu.
    Je crois bien que j'ai un soupçon de jalousie.
    Dame Femitte, vous conduirez mes pensées dans de telles directions inappropriées !${prompt}
  9975: Veuillez transmettre mes salutations à Despachiaire lorsque vous retournerez à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9976: |-

    Le Festival des Poupées a commencé, kupo !${prompt}
  9977: J'ai entendu de mes sources moogles que c'est une célébration pour la santé et le bonheur des filles, kupo.${prompt}
  9978: Apparemment, la jeune fille et son amoureux jouaient à l'impératrice et à l'empereur, et étaient rejoints par huit de leurs amis pour les festivités, kupo.${prompt}

    Pourquoi ne pas essayer de former une équipe de dix personnes également ?
    Nous pourrons tous nous amuser à célébrer le Festival des Poupées, kupo !${prompt}

    On dirait que vous avez tous les membres dont vous avez besoin.

    Bon travail, kupo ! Vous leur avez bien montré qui est le patron !
    Grâce à vous, nous avons pu éviter un désastre diplomatique avec l'Extrême-Orient, kupo.${prompt}

  10476: Tous semblent être présents, alors commençons.${prompt}
  10477: Vous êtes réunis ici aujourd'hui pour discuter des raisons des récents changements de comportement des chocobos.${prompt}
  10478: Parle pour toi. Les chocobos à Bastok semblent très bien se porter.${prompt}
  10479: Pas de problèmes à Windurst non plus.${prompt}
  10480: Ce problème affecte actuellement les nations de San d'Oria et de Jeuno. Il est seulement question de temps avant qu'il ne se propage également à Windurst et à Bastok.${prompt}
  10481: Quoi ? Cela pourrait affecter Windurst ? Eh bien, qu'est-ce que vous attendez ? Allez-y, maintenant !${prompt} 
  10482: Récemment, un chocobo s'est échappé de ces écuries.${prompt}
  10483: J'ai réussi à la retrouver et à la ramener, mais elle agit étrangement depuis.${prompt}
  10484: Elle a souvent la tête dans les nuages, développe un tempérament, et semble toujours agitée...${prompt}
  10485: Pourquoi, la même chose est arrivée à un chocobo dans mon écurie !${prompt}
  10486: Vous deux devriez surveiller de plus près vos chocobos. Vous n'avez personne d'autre à blâmer que vous-mêmes.${prompt}
  10487: Vous avez raison... Je n'aurais jamais dû mentionner les chocobos sauvages devant lui...${prompt}
  10488: Des chocobos sauvages ?${prompt}
  10489: Oui. Le chocobo s'est échappé dès que j'ai fini de parler à cet aventurier ici...${prompt}
  10490: Et c'est à ce moment-là qu'il a commencé à se comporter étrangement ? Serait-ce... ?${prompt}
  10491: Ça doit être... l'appel de la nature.${prompt}
  10492: Oh, donnez-moi une pause... Ces chocobos ont été élevés dans une écurie, pour l'amour d'Altana !${prompt}
  10493: Non. Nous ne devons pas écarter cette possibilité. Comme Brutus, j'ai également découvert mon chocobo sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  10494: Et pour aggraver les choses, le problème se propage aux autres chocobos.${prompt}
  10495: Que voulez-vous dire ? Les gens et les chocobos ont un lien spécial, pas facilement brisé !${prompt}
  10496: Vous devez vous rappeler que les chocobos sont des animaux. Ils retourneront à la nature s'ils en ont la chance.${prompt}
  10497: Ce problème a le potentiel de causer un grand désordre parmi les chocobos s'il n'est pas maîtrisé. Nous devons formuler une solution sans délai.${prompt}
  10498: Je pense que le problème réside dans la façon même dont nous élevons et entraînons nos chocobos.${prompt}
  10499: Nous avons déjà débattu de cette question, non ? Nous venons même de réformer le système !${prompt}
  10500: Je pense toujours qu'il faut plus de travail. Nous avons été trop laxistes en matière de discipline.${prompt} 
  10501: Élever des chocobos ne se résume pas à la discipline ! Nous avons déjà eu cette discussion !${prompt}
  10502: Alors comment expliquez-vous notre problème actuel ? Ce sera notre responsabilité si l'un des chocobos blesse quelqu'un !${prompt}
  10503: Calmez-vous, tous les deux.${prompt}
  10504: Nous sommes tellement habitués à ce genre de discussions que nous avons perdu de vue l'essentiel.${prompt}
  10505: Je pense que nous devrions demander l'opinion de cet aventurier ici.${prompt}
  10506: Vous avez raison. C'est pour ça que j'ai invité ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] ici, après tout.${prompt}

  10509: Nous pourrions prendre une bien meilleure décision sans cet aventurier.${prompt}

    Donnons une autre chance à ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}

    ...D'accord.
    Écoutons ce que ${name-player} a à dire.${prompt}

  10514: Tu vois ? Même ${name-player} est d'accord.${prompt}
  10515: Tu ne sais juste pas quand t'arrêter, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10516: S'il te plaît !${prompt}
  10517: Cela ne ferait-elle pas qu'ils deviennent deux fois plus mauvais ?${prompt}
  10518: |-
    Attends !
    Nous ne saurons pas tant que nous n'aurons pas essayé, n'est-ce pas ? Rassemblons-les tous les deux !${prompt}
  10519: Qu'est-ce qui te prend tout à coup ?${prompt}
  10520: Je pense que cet aventurier tient quelque chose. De plus, nous n'allons rien résoudre en discutant. Nous devrions essayer !${prompt}
  10521: Eh bien... Si tu y tiens tellement...${prompt}
  10522: |-
    Je suppose que c'est ça, alors !
    Je me dirigerai vers Jeuno plus tard.${prompt}
  10523: C'est vraiment une perte de temps...${prompt}
  10524: Penses-tu vraiment que ce plan va fonctionner ?${prompt}
  10525: Génial. Je te soutiens à fond !${prompt}
  10526: Veuillez vous rendre aux écuries de chocobos à Jeuno. Je ramènerai le chocobo avec moi lorsque j'aurai terminé mes préparatifs.${prompt}
  10527: Je suis Hantileon, président de la Société des Chocobos de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10528: Vous semblez également aimer les chocobos... Je peux le dire par le regard dans vos yeux. Je vous autoriserai à rejoindre notre société.${prompt}
  10529: Échangez un œuf avec moi si vous voulez commencer à élever un chocobo.${prompt}

  10754: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  10755: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10756: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10757: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10758: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10759: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10760: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10761: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10762: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10763: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  10770: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10771: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10772: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10773: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10774: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10775: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10776: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10777: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10778: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10779: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10780: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10781: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  10782: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10783: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10784: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10785: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10786: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10787: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10788: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10789: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10790: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10791: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10792: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  10793: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10794: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10795: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10796: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  10797: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10798: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

  10818: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10819: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10820: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10821: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10822: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  10823: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  10824: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10825: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10826: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10827: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  10828: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  10829: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}

  10831: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10832: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10833: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  10834: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  10835: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10836: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10837: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10838: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10839: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10840: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10841: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10844: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10845: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10846: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10847: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10848: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10849: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10850: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10851: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10852: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10853: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  10854: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10855: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10856: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  10857: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  10858: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  10859: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10860: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  10861: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10862: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10863: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  10864: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10865: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  10870: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt}
  10871: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  10872: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  10873: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'
  10874: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt}
  10875: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt}
  10876: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt}

  11484: 'Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt}'

  11488: |-
    ...
    I'm disappointed in you.${prompt}

    I see...

  11534: ${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt}
  11535: I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt}

  12332: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  12333: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  12334: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  12335: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  12336: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  12337: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  12338: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12339: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12340: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12341: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12342: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  12343: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  12344: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  12345: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  12346: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12347: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12348: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12349: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12350: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12351: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12352: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12353: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12354: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  12355: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  12356: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12357: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12358: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12359: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12360: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12361: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  12641: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12642: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12643: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12644: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12645: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12646: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12647: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12648: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12649: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12650: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12651: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12652: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12653: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12654: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12655: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12656: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12657: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12658: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12659: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12660: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12661: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12662: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12663: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12664: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12665: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12666: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12667: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12668: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  12669: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12671: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12672: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12673: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12674: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12675: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12676: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12677: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12678: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12679: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12680: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12681: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12682: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12683: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12684: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12685: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12686: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12687: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12688: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12689: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12691: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12692: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12693: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12694: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12695: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12696: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12697: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12698: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12699: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12700: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12701: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12702: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12703: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12704: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12705: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12706: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12707: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12708: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12709: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12710: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12711: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12712: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'

  12776: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  12777: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  12778: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  12779: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12780: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12781: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12782: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12783: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12784: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12785: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12786: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12787: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12788: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12789: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12790: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12791: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12792: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12793: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12794: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12795: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12796: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12797: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  12798: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  12799: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12800: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12801: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12802: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12803: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12804: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12805: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12806: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12807: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12808: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12809: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12810: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  12872: Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...${prompt}
  12873: '...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt}'
  12874: Good day, fol--${prompt}
  12875: ピヨ！${prompt}
  12876: Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt}
  12877: 'Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana''diel''s top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt}'
  12878: 'First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt}'
  12879: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  12880: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  12881: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12882: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12883: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12884: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12885: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12886: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12887: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12888: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  12889: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  12890: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  12891: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  12892: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  12893: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  12894: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  12895: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  12896: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  12897: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  12898: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12899: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12900: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12901: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12902: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12903: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12904: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12905: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  12906: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  12907: Good day, fol--
  12908: ピヨ！

  12912: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
  12913: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12914: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12915: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12916: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12917: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12918: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12919: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12920: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12921: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12922: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12923: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12924: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12925: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12926: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12927: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12928: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12929: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12930: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12931: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12932: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12933: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12934: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12935: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12936: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12937: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12938: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12939: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12940: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12941: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  12942: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  12943: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  12944: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  12945: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  12946: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12947: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  12948: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  12949: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  12950: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  12951: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  12952: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  12953: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  12954: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  12955: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  12956: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12957: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12958: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12959: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12960: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12961: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12962: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12963: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12964: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12965: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12966: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12967: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12968: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12969: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12970: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12971: And they're off!
  12972: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12973: Well, I fel--
  12974: ピヨピヨッ！
  12975: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12976: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12977: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12978: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12979: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  12980: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12981: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12982: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12983: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12984: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12985: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12986: ピヨピヨ！
  12987: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12988: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12989: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12990: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12991: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12992: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12993: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12994: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  12995: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12996: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12997: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  12998: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  12999: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  13000: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  13001: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  13002: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13003: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  13004: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13005: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13006: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13007: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  13008: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13009: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  13010: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  13011: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  13012: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  13013: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  13014: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  13015: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  13016: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  13017: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  13018: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  13019: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  13020: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  13021: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  13022: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  13023: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  13024: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  13025: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  13026: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  13027: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  13028: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  13029: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  13030: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  13031: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  13032: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  13033: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  13034: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  13035: Until next time, race fans...
  13036: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  13037: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13038: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  13039: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13040: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  13041: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  13042: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  13043: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  13044: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  13059: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  13060: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  13061: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  13062: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  13063: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  13064: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  13065: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  13066: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  13067: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  13068: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  13069: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  13070: But...?${prompt}
  13071: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13072: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  13073: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  13074: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  13075: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  13076: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  13077: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  13078: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  13079: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  13080: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  13081: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  13082: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  13083: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  13084: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  13085: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  13086: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  13087: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  13088: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  13089: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  13090: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  13091: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  13092: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  13093: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  13094: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  13095: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  13096: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  13097: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  13098: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  13099: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  13100: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  13101: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  13102: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  13103: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  13104: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  13105: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  13106: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  13107: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  13108: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13109: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  13110: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  13111: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  13112: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  13113: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  13114: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  13115: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  13116: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  13117: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  13118: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  13119: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  13120: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  13121: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  13122: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  13123: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  13124: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  13125: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  13126: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  13127: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  13128: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  13129: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  13130: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  13131: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  13132: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  13133: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  13134: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  13135: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  13136: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  13137: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  13138: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13139: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13140: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  13141: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  13142: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  13143: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  13144: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  13145: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  13146: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  13147: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13148: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13149: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  13150: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  13151: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  13152: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  13153: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  13154: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13155: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  13156: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13157: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  13158: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  13159: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  13160: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  13161: '...${prompt}'
  13162: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  13163: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  13164: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  13165: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  13166: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  13167: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  13168: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  13169: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  13170: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  13171: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  13172: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  13173: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  13174: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  13175: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  13176: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  13177: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  13178: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  13179: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  13180: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  13181: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  13182: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  13183: '...${prompt}'
  13184: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  13185: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  13186: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  13187: What's more...${prompt}
  13188: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  13189: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13190: What...?${prompt}
  13191: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  13192: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  13193: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  13194: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  13195: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  13196: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13197: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  13198: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  13199: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  13200: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  13201: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  13202: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  13203: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  13204: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13205: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13206: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  13207: And they're off!
  13208: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  13209: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  13210: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  13211: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  13212: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  13213: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  13214: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  13215: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  13216: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13217: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13218: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  13219: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13220: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  13221: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13222: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13223: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  13224: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  13225: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  13226: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  13227: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  13228: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  13229: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  13230: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  13231: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  13232: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  13233: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  13234: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  13235: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  13236: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  13237: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  13238: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  13239: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  13240: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  13241: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  13242: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  13243: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  13244: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  13245: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  13246: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  13247: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  13248: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  13249: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  13250: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  13251: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  13252: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  13253: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  13254: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  13255: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  13256: |-

    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  13277: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  13278: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  13279: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  13280: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  13281: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  13282: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'

  13284: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  13285: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Perchance you have come to question the authenticity of my testimony regarding the Sentinels. I do not deny that I may have possibly added a bit of color to the facts surrounding the true nature of our fine leader, but all's well that ends well, no?${prompt}
  13286: Ah, yet you need not fret any longer, my fine friend. Our prodigal president and provider once again has proffered forth her ever-giving hands in a selfless gesture of heartwarming charity.${prompt}
  13287: From this day forth, all employees of Salaheem's Sentinels can now teleport freely from San d'Oria to Aht Urhgan Whitegate!${prompt}

    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.

    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...

  13304: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  13305: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  13306: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  13307: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  13308: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  13309: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  13310: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  13311: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  13312: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  13313: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  13314: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}

    Are you ready to go?

    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  13318: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13319: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  13320: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  13321: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}

    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?

    Not today.${prompt}
  13325: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  13326: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  13327: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  13328: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  13329: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  13330: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  13331: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  13332: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  13333: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  13334: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  13335: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  13336: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  13337: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  13338: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  13339: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  13340: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  13341: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  13342: Kupopo...${prompt}
  13343: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  13344: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'

  13381: Eh bien... hmmm... Oh ! Et que dirais-tu d'une coccinelle ? Ce sont de petits parasites distinctifs avec des corps rouges vifs et semi-circulaires, trois taches noires distinctives et...${prompt}
  13382: |-
    Je m'excuse, j'ai complètement oublié mes manières ! Tu dois m'excuser.
    C'est un plaisir de faire ta connaissance. Je suis Atelloune, l'assistante du célèbre biologiste Professeur Clauvert B Chanoix.${prompt}
  13383: Pour aider à la recherche du professeur, je cherche toutes sortes de spécimens de Quon et de Mindartia dont les effectifs ont diminué ces dernières années.${prompt}
  13384: Je pensais juste qu'un aventurier comme vous avait sûrement vu des créatures rares lors de vos voyages... mais peu importe. Je suis désolé de vous avoir dérangé.${prompt}
  13385: Salutations, aventurier. San d'Oria est reconnaissante pour vos services. Je suis le Valet Royal Esmallegue.${prompt}
  13386: Le Grand Chevalier Depardal a quitté son poste de sentinelle dans les Terres Extérieures. Pour l'instant, il a été enrôlé en tant que membre de la force de défense de la ville.${prompt}
  13387: Comme vous le savez sûrement déjà, l'armée de San d'Oria est divisée en deux branches, les Chevaliers Royaux et les Chevaliers du Temple.${prompt}
  13388: En temps de paix, nous, les Chevaliers Royaux, sommes chargés de la défense de la nation, tandis que les Chevaliers du Temple sont responsables du maintien de l'ordre public. Cependant, en temps de guerre, les Chevaliers du Temple sont chargés de superviser nos rangs.${prompt}
  13389: Malheureusement, c'est une source de conflit. Malgré notre appartenance à un même royaume, il existe un fort sentiment de rivalité entre les deux armées. On dit qu'il y avait beaucoup de zones de friction entre nous pendant la Grande Guerre.${prompt}
  13390: Bonjour. Dis-moi, si tu as un peu de temps, pourrais-tu m'écouter ? J'ai un petit problème...${prompt}
  13391: Eh bien, je ne sais pas si tu le savais déjà ou non, mais je suis Atelloune, l'assistant du grand zoologiste, le Professeur Clavauert B Chanoix.${prompt}
  13392: Je reçois beaucoup de courrier dans mon travail. Tu sais, des lettres de personnes de tous âges passionnées par les animaux, me posant toutes sortes de questions.${prompt}
  13393: J'ai récemment trouvé une lettre dont l'écriture gribouillée a attiré mon attention.${prompt}
  13394: Elle a été envoyée par un jeune Elvaan qui n'a pas donné son nom.${prompt}
  13395: Cher Atelloune, mon grand-père dit qu'à mon âge, il y avait de gros insectes ronds rouges dans la forêt de Ronfaure.${prompt}
  13396: Mais je pense qu’il devient sénile et qu’il pense juste à une pomme. Soit ça, soit il ment, et il n’y a jamais eu de bugs comme ça. S’il te plaît, dis-lui qu’il est fou.${prompt}
  13397: '...Hmmm.${prompt}'
  13398: Je suis vraiment désolé de vous embêter avec ça.${prompt}
  13399: C’est juste que ce gamin m’a vraiment agacé. Je veux dire, il n’y a même pas de question ! Tellement irritant...${prompt}
  13400: |-
    I'm thinking that what he is referring to may be the ladybug.
    It was a species of vermin which inhabited the Ronfaure region before the war.${prompt}
  13401: You know, when I was just a little girl I mistook them for app--${prompt}
  13402: Never mind that!${prompt}
  13403: Let's focus on the real problem here. The ladybug supposedly went extinct a long time ago.${prompt}
  13404: But here's where it gets really interesting!${prompt}
  13405: I believe that there must still be some ladybugs out there somewhere in Vana'diel! If you ever happen to see one in your travels, please try and bring me back a live specimen!${prompt}
  13406: 'Wait...that''s going to be tough. They''re actually quite large animals. And I wouldn''t want to harm them... Well, if you ever chance upon the corpse of one do you think you could bring back the ${item-plural: 0[2]} for me? You''ll know them when you see them. That''s all I need.${prompt}'
  13407: I'd reeeally like to blow this brat's mind. And I think that would do just the trick.${prompt}
  13408: 'Oh my! Is this really ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!?${prompt}'
  13409: Wow, it's even more beautiful than I imagined. Such brilliance! And this contrast between the red and black... Absolutely remarkable!${prompt}
  13410: Where did you find this!?${prompt}
  13411: Ahhh, playing your cards tight to the vest, eh? That's fine, suit yourself.${prompt}
  13412: It doesn't matter. This is exactly what I need to make a believer out of that little Elvaan brat. Maybe now he'll recognize the true beauty of the ladybug!${prompt}
  13413: To think of that poor grandfather, being called a liar by his own grandchild! Well, this should help him sleep at night.${prompt}
  13414: I must say, it's all thanks to you. I'll tell you what. In return, I'll let you in on a little secret...${prompt}
  13415: The real reason why the ladybugs went extinct...${prompt}
  13416: |-
    To be honest, not even the most esteemed minds in the ecological field could explain why it happened.
    But I've come across some...other information.${prompt}
  13417: Rumor has it that right around the time of the Great War the ladybugs were overhunted to extinction by an inconsiderate people with no regard for the natural balance.${prompt}
  13418: They were described as seemingly possessed, an eerie and ominous group. Obsessed with the red and black colors of the ladybug, which they could constantly be heard murmuring, as if in a trance. "Red...black..."${prompt}
  13419: There's no doubt in my mind that these wings were in high demand for some reason or another back then.${prompt}
  13420: For example, perhaps some military strategists thought up an application for this characteristic design which so effectively startles predators.${prompt}
  13421: The possibilities are endless!${prompt}
  13422: '...${prompt}'
  13423: What? Why are you looking at me like that?${prompt}
  13424: Don't misunderstand. I'll see to it that these wings make their way to that little Elvaan boy...just as soon as I run some tests of my own!${prompt}
  13425: Here, now take this and be on your way. And no dropping in unannounced! I have work to do...${prompt}
  13426: Welcome to the Lion Springs!${prompt}
  13427: You wish my permission to dance on the stage?${prompt}
  13428: Why, I have not had dancers here since Troupe Brilioth graced us with a performance.${prompt}
  13429: |-
    As I recall, my customers were riotously appreciative...
    Their cheers shook the very walls of the tavern.${prompt}
  13430: |-
    Are you sure you're a dancer?
    It is just that you seem so...nervous.${prompt}

    Well, I suppose even professionals have the jitters every now and again.

  13436: My eyes...
  13437: Your dancing style is...quite unique.${prompt}
  13438: You know, I'm not sure my establishment is the right place for such an “original” performance...${prompt}
  13439: Your dancing style was...quite unique...${prompt}
  13440: |-
    You there, adventurer!
    I wonder have you heard of the so-called “Cavernous Maws”?
    That is what many are calling the strange stone effigies appearing throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13441: I don't know if it's true or not, but some say that it was the wicked rituals of Orcish mesmerizers on the stones that caused them to assume that wretched form.${prompt}
  13442: The San d'Oria residential area is ahead. You'll find your Mog House within.${prompt}
  13443: Ahead lies the residential area. Proceed to your Rent-a-Room, foreigner!${prompt}

    So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?

  13560: |-
    Le Signet t'aide même lorsque tu n'es pas engagé dans un combat. Par exemple, il augmente la vitesse de guérison pendant le repos.

    Ce repas particulier augmentera temporairement ta puissance d'attaque lorsque tu le mangeras.${prompt}
  13563: |-
    Chaque fois que tu consommes un type de repas, tu recevras un bonus de statut temporaire.
    Naturellement, différents repas confèrent différents types de bonus.${prompt}

    Pour la plupart, les plats de viande affecteront la puissance d'attaque.
    À l'inverse, les plats de fruits de mer augmentent généralement la défense, et ainsi de suite.
    Veille à choisir les plats les mieux adaptés à ton objectif.${prompt}
  13565: |-
    Une chose dont tu devrais te souvenir, cependant, est que tu ne peux pas manger un repas pendant que le bonus de statut d'un autre repas est encore en cours.

    Regarde ce ventre bien rempli ! Bien joué !

  13572: Sortir par cette porte là-bas te mènera dans une zone avec des ennemis hostiles.${prompt}
  13573: |-
    Essaie de cibler l'un des monstres, puis sélectionne l'option “Examiner” dans ton menu.
    Cela t'aidera à déterminer le niveau de difficulté d'un ennemi et à t'assurer qu'il n'est pas trop fort. Un aventurier avisé choisit ${choice-player-gender}[ses combats/le combat].${prompt}
  13574: Attention. Affronter un ennemi qui se révèle “très difficile” ou plus entraînera l'annulation des bonus de défense et d'esquive normalement accordés par ton Signet.${prompt}
  13575: Et cela nous amène à ta prochaine mission !${prompt}
  13576: Il est grand temps que tu apprennes à utiliser une “compétence d'arme” !${prompt}
  13577: Peut-être l'as-tu déjà remarqué, mais parfois, en combattant un ennemi, tes “compétences” augmentent petit à petit.${prompt}
  13578: Lorsque ta compétence avec l'arme que tu manies atteint une valeur prédéterminée, des compétences d'arme deviennent disponibles pour utilisation.${prompt}
  13579: |-
    “Combo” pour ceux adeptes des armes de combat à mains nues. “Piqûre de guêpe” pour ceux qui combattent avec des dagues.
    “Lame rapide” pour ceux qui préfèrent l'épée.${prompt}
  13580: |-
    “Frappe éclatante” pour les porteurs de massues. “Coup lourd” pour ceux qui prennent le bâton.
    Et ainsi de suite, et ainsi de suite...${prompt}
  13581: |-
    Sélectionner “Statut” dans le menu principal fera apparaître l'option “Compétence combat”.
    Cela affichera toutes les valeurs de compétence actuelles dans toutes les catégories d'armes.${prompt}
  13582: |-
    La première compétence d'arme pour chaque type d'arme peut être apprise avec une valeur de compétence de 5.
    Donc, fais-en ton premier objectif, et nous prendrons le relais à partir de là !${prompt}
  13583: |-
    Ohhh ! Quelqu'un a appris une nouvelle compétence d'arme, n'est-ce pas ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] ?
    Très bien !${prompt}
  13584: |-
    Je vois à cette lueur dans tes yeux que tu l'as déjà utilisée sur une pauvre créature malchanceuse, mais je vais expliquer encore un peu plus.
    Chaque fois que tes “Points Tactiques” (PT) atteignent 1000 ou plus, sélectionner “Capacités” puis “Compétence combat” dans le menu affichera une liste de compétences d'arme utilisables.${prompt}
  13585: |-
    Ce sont des techniques mortelles capables d'infliger des dégâts massifs aux ennemis.
    Il vaut vraiment la peine pour un aventurier d'apprendre et de maîtriser ces compétences.${prompt}
  13586: Ah, au fait, avez-vous eu la chance de recevoir des objets des monstres que vous avez combattus ?${prompt}
  13587: |-
    Si vous avez eu la chance de trouver des ${item-plural: 0[2]}, assurez-vous de les conserver.
    Ils pourraient rapporter gros plus tard...${prompt}
  13588: |-
    Au fait, cela me rappelle. Il y a une autre leçon qu'il vaut mieux apprendre tôt que tard.
    Les objets que vous rencontrerez sans aucun doute, connus sous le nom de “cristaux”, tels que ${item-plural: 1[2]} et ${item-plural: 2[2]}, sont extrêmement importants.${prompt}
  13589: |-
    Ce sont vraiment des objets polyvalents qui peuvent être utilisés à plusieurs fins.
    Cela inclut les échanger aux gardes contre certaines récompenses et les vendre pour gagner de l'argent, pour n'en citer que quelques-unes.${prompt}
  13590: Pour l'instant, j'aimerais expliquer davantage un autre de leurs utilisations. À savoir, le rôle qu'ils jouent dans la “synthèse”.${prompt}
  13591: |-
    Mais avant toute chose. Votre récompense pour avoir accompli votre dernière mission ! Voici ce qu'il en est.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et enfin, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  13592: |-
    Maintenant, utiliser ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} fera apparaître l'interface de synthèse.
    Une fois là-bas, sélectionnez ${item-singular: 1[2]} et ${item-singular: 2[2]} comme ingrédients à ajouter.${prompt}
  13593: Tout ce qu'il reste à faire est de sélectionner l'option “OK”, et la synthèse commencera !${prompt}
  13594: |-
    Vous constaterez que le processus de fabrication ne commencera jamais si les ingrédients que vous avez sélectionnés ne forment pas une recette de synthèse viable.
    De plus, même lorsque vos matériaux sont corrects, il y a toujours une chance que votre synthèse échoue, alors soyez prudent.${prompt}
  13595: La majorité des objets que vous créez via la synthèse, ainsi que la plupart de ceux laissés par les ennemis que vous battez, peuvent être placés sur le “Bureau des ventes” pour la vente.${prompt}
  13596: Le bureau des ventes est un lieu de consommation ultra où vous pouvez tenter d'acheter les marchandises d'autres joueurs en plaçant des enchères, ainsi que de permettre à d'autres joueurs d'enchérir sur les objets que vous avez mis en vente.${prompt}
  13597: |-
    Mes mots seuls ne peuvent rendre justice à la vaste cornucopie de biens qu'est le bureau des ventes.
    Il faut simplement le voir de ses propres yeux.${prompt}
  13598: |-
    Êtes-vous toujours avec moi?
    ${selection-lines}
    Expliquer à nouveau la synthèse.
    Expliquer à nouveau le bureau des ventes.
    Bien sûr.${prompt}
  13599: Quelque part dans cette grande ville se trouve le bureau des ventes de notre nation. Trouvez-le, et revenez me voir lorsque vous l'aurez trouvé.${prompt}
  13600: |-
    Vous n'avez pas besoin de vous soucier de procéder à un achat réel.
    Il suffit simplement d'examiner l'un des “Comptoirs de vente aux enchères”.${prompt}
  13601: |-
    Alors, vous avez pu localiser le bureau des ventes!
    Plutôt difficile à manquer, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
  13602: |-
    Qu'en pensez-vous? C'est comme je l'ai dit, n'est-ce pas? Peu d'organisations dans ce monde dépassent le bureau des ventes en termes d'échelle.
    Il ne cessera jamais de vous être utile tout au long de vos aventures. Il serait sage de devenir compétent dans son utilisation.${prompt}
  13603: |-
    Et maintenant, passons aux choses sérieuses!
    Voyons si nous ne pouvons pas vous faire monter de niveau!${prompt}
  13604: Il existe plusieurs objets qui servent à augmenter le nombre de points d'expérience que vous recevez pour avoir vaincu des ennemis.${prompt}
  13605: 'Par exemple, il y a des ${item-plural: 0[2]}, des ${item-plural: 1[2]}, et des ${item-plural: 2[2]}, pour n’en citer que quelques-uns.${prompt}'
  13606: Ceux-ci sont un peu particuliers car vous devez attendre un certain temps après les avoir équipés avant de pouvoir les utiliser.${prompt}
  13607: |-
    Il y a aussi un laps de temps prédéterminé, généralement assez long, qui doit s'écouler avant que ces objets puissent être réutilisés.
    Le nombre total de fois que vous pouvez utiliser un seul objet est également limité, alors veillez également à en tenir compte.${prompt}
  13608: |-
    Beaucoup de ces objets peuvent être obtenus auprès des mêmes gardes qui vous fournissent le Signet.
    Vous n'avez qu'à échanger des “Points de conquête” pour les acquérir.${prompt}
  13609: |-
    En fait, pour avoir terminé cette dernière mission, je vais vous donner ce ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Avec ça, vous pourrez obtenir ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} sans avoir à utiliser vos Points de conquête.${prompt}
  13610: |-
    Rendez-vous auprès de n'importe quel garde et essayez d'en échanger contre quelque chose.
    Et après cela, voyez si vous ne pouvez pas atteindre le niveau quatre.
    Je serai ici à vous attendre lorsque vous reviendrez.${prompt}
  13611: |-
    Avec un bonus d'expérience en place, cela ne devrait vous prendre pratiquement aucun temps.
    Bonne chance, et faites attention! Ça peut devenir assez compliqué là-bas!${prompt}
  13612: |-
    Eh bien, eh bien, eh bien! Nous pourrions bien faire de vous un aventurier après tout!
    On dirait que nous avons presque enlevé toute cette inexpérience de vous.${prompt}
  13613: |-
    A bit of bad news now, though.
    Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
  13614: |-
    As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
    You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
  13615: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
  13616: |-
    Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
    It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  13617: |-
    Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
    Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
  13618: |-
    Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
    In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
  13619: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items work in the same manner as the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier.
    That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
  13620: |-
    All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
    There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
    It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
  13621: |-
    It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
    Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
  13622: '${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}'
  13623: |-
    You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
    It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
  13624: |-
    Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
    Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
  13625: |-
    Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
    If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
  13626: |-
    I know those smells...
    You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13627: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
  13628: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
  13629: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
  13630: If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
  13631: |-
    Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
    You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
  13632: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
  13633: |-
    I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
    I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
  13634: |-
    Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
    You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
  13635: |-
    I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
    Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
  13636: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  13637: |-
    But don't go getting too cocky!
    This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
  13638: |-
    Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
    I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
  13639: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
  13640: |-
    Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
    You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
  13641: |-
    There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
    Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
  13642: |-
    And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
    The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
  13643: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
  13644: 'I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}'
  13645: 'Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}'
  13646: |-
    There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
    Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
  13647: 'Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}'
  13648: |-
    Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
    And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
  13649: |-
    This shall be your final assignment.
    Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
  13650: |-
    Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
    Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13651: |-
    And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
    As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
  13652: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
  13653: |-
    Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
    Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
  13654: |-
    Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
    You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
  13655: 'And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13656: |-
    I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
    From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
  13657: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
  13658: |-
    Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
    It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
  13659: |-
    I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
    It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
  13660: |-
    There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
    Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
    I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
  13661: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13662: |-
    Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13663: |-
    Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13664: |-
    Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13665: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing just now.
    Search comments.
    Skillchains.
    Magic bursts.
    Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
  13666: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
  13667: |-
    There are several different categories of search comments.
    These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
  13668: Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
  13669: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
  13670: Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
  13671: |-
    Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
    You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
  13672: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
  13673: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
  13674: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
  13675: Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
  13676: |-
    In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
    Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
  13677: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
  13678: |-
    One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
    It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
  13679: |-
    The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
    It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
  13680: |-
    Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
    You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
  13681: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
  13682: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
  13683: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
  13684: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
  13685: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
  13686: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
  13687: |-
    Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):
    Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),
    Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),
    Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).${prompt}
  13688: |-
    Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder),
    Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).${prompt}
  13689: |-
    Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder),
    Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).${prompt}
  13690: Amaura!${prompt}
  13691: Well, well, if it isn't little Lilisette!${prompt}
  13692: It's lovely to see you again, Amaura. You're looking well.${prompt}
  13693: |-
    Oh, my, just look at ye! How ye've grown!
    Why, the last time I saw ye would've been the day Sir Ragelise passed away...${prompt}
  13694: Yes...${prompt}
  13695: And what's the pretty little number ye've got on there, eh? Looks mighty familiar, like somethin' your mother used to wear.${prompt}
  13696: You like it? It's the performance outfit for my dance troupe. I'm actually a famous dancer now, you know.${prompt}
  13697: A dance troupe, ye say? Do those things still even exist? The closest thing we have comin' to San d'Oria nowadays is that Valeriano crew, what with their fire breathin' and sword jugglin' and--${prompt}
  13698: |-
    Um, yes, we're rather rare nowadays...
    But, more importantly, I have a favor to ask, Amaura. I need you to make that medicine again.${prompt}
  13699: Medicine, ye say? You mean the same one I brewed for your father all those years ago?${prompt}
  13700: Yes. You see, someone I know is experiencing similar symptoms...${prompt}
  13701: |-
    Is that right...?
    It breaks my heart to have to disappoint ye, dearie, but I can't make that medicine anymore.${prompt}
  13702: Wh-what? But, why?${prompt}
  13703: |-
    <Sigh>...
    The main ingredient, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, can no longer be found.${prompt}
  13704: Oh...${prompt}
  13705: 'A real shame, I know, but it''s been that way for some years, ever since the last batch of ${item-plural: 0[2]} was harvested.${prompt}'
  13706: There's nary a mature tree to be seen nowadays. It's like they all just up and disappeared off the horizon.${prompt}
  13707: And to think that not a decade ago, the saplings from which the bulbs could be obtained were still as common as those pesky little hares out in Ronfaure...${prompt}
  13708: Saplings...in the past...!${prompt}
  13709: ${name-player}, I trust I needn't tell you what our next course of action is.${prompt}
  13710: |-
    Even extinction is no match for this tag-team duo! Whatever the task, and no matter the odds, Future Fabulous shall prevail!
    Heheheheheh...${prompt}
  13711: 'My, my, be that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ye have there?${prompt}'
  13712: |-
    Why, I haven't seen one of these for...
    Actually, I can't remember when I last saw one. How did ye come by it?${prompt}
  13713: This is what you said you wanted, right? Please, Amaura, I need the medicine as soon as--${prompt}
  13714: Ohoho, ever the impatient young Lilisette, I see. Ye never were one for waiting.${prompt}
  13715: I hate to have to disappoint ye again, dearie, but the mature tree is what we need.${prompt}
  13716: What!?${prompt}
  13717: Try planting that bulb by the shore of an unspoilt lake.${prompt}
  13718: Once it has grown to maturity, ye'll find resin seeping out from the crack of ripened fruit. That resin, solidified, is what is needed to make our medicine.${prompt}
  13719: Alright... I'll do as you say...${prompt}
  13720: Yes, yes, that's the spirit. Ye'll have something to look forward to ten, perhaps twenty, years from now.${prompt}
  13721: What!?${prompt}
  13722: Ohoho, it seems I've developed a knack for disappointing ye!${prompt}

  13868: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  13869: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  13870: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  13871: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  13872: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  13873: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  13874: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  13875: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  13876: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  13877: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  13878: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  13879: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  13880: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  13881: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  13882: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13883: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  13884: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  13885: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  13886: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  13887: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  13888: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  13889: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  13890: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  13891: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13892: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  13893: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  13894: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  13895: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  13896: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  13897: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  13898: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  13899: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  13900: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  13901: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  13902: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  13903: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  13904: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  13905: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  13906: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  13907: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  13908: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  13909: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  13910: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  13911: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  13912: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  13913: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  13914: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  13915: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  13916: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  13917: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13918: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  13919: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  13920: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  13921: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  13922: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  13923: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  13924: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  13925: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  13926: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  13927: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  13928: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  13929: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  13930: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  13931: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  13932: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  13933: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  13934: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  13935: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  13936: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  13937: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13938: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  13939: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  13940: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  13941: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  13942: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  13943: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  13944: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  13945: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  13946: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  13947: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  13948: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  13949: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  13950: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  13951: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13952: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  13967: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  13968: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}
  13969: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not today.
    Teach me!
    Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  13970: |-
    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  13971: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  13972: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  13973: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  13974: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  13975: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  13976: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  13977: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  13978: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  13979: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  13980: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  13981: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  13982: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  13983: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  13984: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  13985: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  13986: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  13987: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt}
  13988: What in the world...?${prompt}
  13989: Our future...is fading away?
  13990: Th-the comet...${prompt}
  13991: Are we the only ones...who can see it?${prompt}
  13992: |-
    The situation is worse than I feared. We haven't any time to waste.
    As for who we could speak to...${prompt}
  13993: |-
    How about Monarlais Halver, whom we accompanied to entreat the aid of Bastok and Windurst in the past?
    Considering his post, he should be well versed in all things regarding the Crystal War.${prompt}
  13994: Whether or not he remembers the two of us, though, we'll just have to find out.${prompt}
  13995: |-
    What's that? You wish to hear of my father?
    Forgive me, but I'm far too busy to indulge in idle reminiscing.${prompt}
  13996: |-
    Perhaps you can seek out my son Ailbeche.
    The boy was quite close to his grandfather.${prompt}
  13997: 'Why, those ${item-singular: 0[2]}...!${prompt}'
  13998: |-
    They bear a remarkable resemblance to a prized possession of my dear departed father's.
    Oh, the memories this brings back!${prompt}
  13999: |-
    Father was quite the ardent angler, you see.
    In fact, I cannot recall a single day that he did not make the trip to Lake Mechieume.${prompt}
  14000: |-
    Oh, of course he'd spare an hour here or there to instruct me in swordplay.
    A gesture for which I was most thankful, to be sure.${prompt}
  14001: |-
    But this was but a diversion for him.
    That angling was his true passion was clear for all to see.${prompt}
  14002: |-
    So all-consuming was his obsession that I grew to resent him.
    What kind of father could harbor a greater love for fishing than for his own family?${prompt}
  14003: As it turns out, I had misjudged the man.${prompt}
  14004: |-
    I heard the truth from my mother one day.
    Fishing as a craft was of little interest to him, she said.${prompt}
  14005: And yet, it was an age of war, with foodstuffs few and far between.${prompt}
  14006: |-
    This is what drove my father to make the perilous journey through Jugner Forest each and every dawn.
    A desire to provide sustenance, not just to his own beloved family, but to his suffering countrymen as well.${prompt}
  14007: The father I had seen as little but a cruel taskmaster was, in fact, a deeply honorable, self-sacrificing soul.${prompt}
  14008: I was instilled with a newfound pride, and swore that one day I would instill my son with the same values that my father had stood for.${prompt}
  14009: |-
    'Tis a comical twist of fate, is it not?
    In the end, all that he inherited from his grandfather was his skill with the rod and lure.${prompt}
  14010: My apologies. Whatever has gotten into me, to get so caught up in trivial nostalgia?${prompt}
  14011: |-
    At any rate, I wish you the best in your travels.
    Farewell!${prompt}
  14012: Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.${prompt}
  14013: |-
    Those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused.
    Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.${prompt}
  14014: Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  14040: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  14041: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  14042: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  14043: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  14044: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14045: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  14046: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  14047: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  14048: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  14049: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  14050: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.
    For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt}

    Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.

  14855: Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt}
  14856: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  14857: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14858: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  14859: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14860: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}
  14861: Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt}
  14862: Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt}
  14863: |-
    Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
    Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt}
  14864: |-
    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.
    They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt}
  14865: Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt}
  14866: 'The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt}'
  14867: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  14868: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  14869: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  14870: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  14871: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  14872: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  14873: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  14874: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  14875: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  14876: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  14877: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14878: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  14879: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  14880: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  14881: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  14882: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  14883: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  14884: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  14885: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14886: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  14887: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  14888: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14889: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  14890: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  14891: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  14892: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  14893: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  14894: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  14895: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  14896: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  14897: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  14898: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  14899: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14900: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  14901: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  14902: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14903: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  14904: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  14905: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  14906: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  14907: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  14908: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  14909: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14910: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  14911: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  14912: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  14913: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  14914: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  14915: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  14916: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  14917: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  14918: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  14919: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  14920: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  14921: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  14922: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  14923: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  14924: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14925: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  14926: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  14927: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  14928: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  14929: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  14930: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  14931: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  14932: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  14933: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  14934: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  14935: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  14936: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  14937: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14938: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  14939: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  14940: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  14941: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  14942: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  14943: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  14944: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  14945: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  14946: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  14947: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  14948: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  14949: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}

  15302: But there was an--inconsequential?--issue with them consuming crystals like crunchy candies.${prompt}
  15303: Thanks to hardy heroes and moogle magic, we turned them into cerulean stone shards and sent them scurrying home, kupo.${prompt}
  15304: But we gave the victors great gifts resembling those rowdy ruffians, so our profits plummeted and we had to cancel our tropical travel plans...${prompt}

  15320: Yes? Mm hmm... Mm hmm...${prompt}

  15330: Most excellent explorer, please travel outside town and round up these recidivist reprobates!${prompt}

  15512: The leading council has bid me come to this fair land of San d'Oria with a most sacred mission.${prompt}
  15513: Several moons past, our famed institute held a lavish symposium at which we made privy to the public information about a new form of magic.${prompt}
  15514: These new forms of incantations, which we call “Trust,” would prove a mighty boon to adventurers of your caliber.${prompt}

    How fortuitous! I swear by every gray hair on this head that you will not regret it!
    Your first task is to head to the city gates in Northern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15519: There you will find someone engaged in the running of “Ballista,” a type of mock skirmish. Some call him by the moniker of “the grand hero of San d'Oria.”${prompt}
  15520: As you have already surmised, experimental magic may have unknown effects on the world, so he is very careful to ensure the safety of everyone involved.${prompt}
  15521: In fact, he is so dedicated to this goal that he himself stepped up as the nation's first participant in the program.${prompt}
  15522: The two other grand nations--Bastok and Windurst--have also seen others step up to try their hand at this wonderful manifestation of the arcane.${prompt}
  15523: But we will leave those journeys for a later date. Your first step starts here, in San d'Oria, where you will garner the services of one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.${prompt}

  15527: Take this letter of introduction with you and head to Ranperre Gate in Northern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15528: To get to Northern San d'Oria, you must first head west of here, then north toward Victory Square.${prompt}
  15529: After reaching Northern San d'Oria, you are to make for Ranperre Gate. Once there, seek out Excenmille--and pray do not affront him in any fashion. The words of a hero such as he carry unmatched weight in this land.${prompt}

    Ce qu'est la Confiance.
    Ce qui se passe lorsqu'on utilise la Confiance.
    Comment apprendre de nouveaux sorts de Confiance.
    Où se trouvent les participants à la Confiance.
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  15532: La Confiance est une nouvelle série d'incantations magiques tissées en existence par l'Institut d'Études Magiques de Jeuno, annoncée lors de notre récent symposium.${prompt}
  15533: Peut-être que le terme "incantations" est un peu trompeur. Plutôt que de s'appuyer sur la manipulation éthérique, la Confiance puise dans la connexion spirituelle entre ceux liés par un amour ${choice-player-gender}[fraternel/sororal].${prompt}
  15534: Pour vous amener à la conclusion logique de mon explication, je dirai que cette magie peut être utilisée quelle que soit la vocation de son utilisateur. Simple et profitable à la fois.${prompt}
  15535: Comme la technique dépend de la connexion entre deux âmes, toute interférence par une multitude d'âmes, comme dans les villes, rend la technique inutilisable.${prompt}
  15536: L'utilisation de la magie de Confiance permet au lanceur d'appeler des alter ego de ceux avec qui ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] a formé des liens d'amitié et de confiance.${prompt}
  15537: Comme cette technique utilise la résonance entre deux esprits apparentés, l'alter ego qui se manifeste correspond toujours au lanceur, qu'il soit faible ou fort.${prompt}
  15538: Les voyages sont bien plus satisfaisants lorsque vous avez un compagnon, n'est-ce pas ? L'alter ego que vous invoquez se battra bravement à vos côtés, mais vous ne pourrez pas lui donner d'ordres tactiques détaillés.${prompt} 
  15539: Si vous souhaitez renvoyer l'alter ego d'où il vient, il vous suffit de lui parler et d'exprimer votre désir. Un moment doux-amer, à n'en pas douter.${prompt}
  15540: Les alter ego subissent des blessures comme vous et moi, et s'ils tombent au combat, ils disparaîtront. Voir quelqu'un de si cher s'estomper... cela vous tire une larme, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  15541: Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, mon disciple ! Après un court laps de temps, vous pourrez le ramener dans le monde une fois de plus. Votre tristesse ne sera plus que des chuchotements sur le vent.${prompt}
  15542: Faire apparaître un alter ego n'est pas un processus simple. Vous devez d'abord forger des liens intangibles avec ceux dont vous souhaitez obtenir l'aide.${prompt}
  15543: Cultivez soigneusement la confiance et le respect entre vous et un praticien, car cette technique ne peut fonctionner que si les liens entre vous sont aussi solides que l'acier.${prompt}
  15544: Know you the adage “opposites attract”? Assuredly, such is not the case here. Storied personages have little time for those whose deeds are not sung as widely as their own.${prompt}
  15545: But all I have just told you can be circumvented, as research into new methods of calling forth alter egos has been ongoing. It is possible to summon one without having so much as met the person.${prompt}
  15546: As you can imagine, this requires a bit of tinkering with the aether, but it is indeed possible. All I require is the appropriate scroll.${prompt}

  15551: Funny story, that. They are also involved in the Trust initiative.${prompt}
  15552: I must bow my head in appreciation for all that you and your ilk have done for us. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.${prompt}
  15553: I am more than pleased to report that your activities on our behalf have aided the institute in posting never-before-seen results.${prompt}
  15554: Always cherish the bonds you have formed with that person, for such resilient ties take years--decades!--to form.${prompt}
  15555: May your trust and friendship blossom into the envy of all!${prompt}
  15556: Wh-who? This old mind does not work like it used to, for I know not one whit about that person.${prompt}
  15557: Bah! What exactly am I supposed to do with this pile of nonsense?${prompt}
  15558: But lest you think otherwise, it is the parchment to blame. Some strange energy prevents it from being properly read.${prompt}
  15559: '${color-alt: 138}You cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana''diel.'
  15560: Even I cannot tell who this cipher is supposed to call. Let me get out my reading glasses and take a gander, hmm?${prompt}
  15561: Oho! A strange apparition, you say?${prompt}
  15562: Glad I could help you reach even greater heights. May you enjoy many bright years with your new companion.${prompt}
  15563: Though I perhaps should not share this information with one not of the institute, lately we have been pushing the limits of the Trust initiative beyond just the five races.${prompt}
  15564: Let us get down to business, you say? Use these newfound powers?${prompt}
  15565: Then we shall commune together. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt}
  15566: A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt}
  15567: Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt}
  15568: You know about this all-important Trust initiative already? Rumors truly do spread like wildfire on a dry summer day.${prompt}
  15569: Whether my compatriots in Bastok or Windurst informed you is of little consequence. What matters most is that you are here--and wish to engage in the trials we San d'Orians can offer.${prompt}
  15570: 'Oh ho! Is that ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} you have there mayhap?${prompt}'
  15571: Doctor Monberaux is a doctor of much renown throughout Jeuno. I have been meaning to have him take a look at my creaky old back.${prompt}
  15572: By the by, when we spoke with him about helping us with our Trust magic, he asked if his friend could join too.${prompt}
  15573: It seems his friend Wolf-something is quite popular with ladies of a certain age such as Ilumida. He received quite a glowing recommendation.${prompt}
  15574: Unfortunately, things ended up being a bit complicated. No, it was not like anybody was jealous of him or anything.${prompt}
  15575: Now, where was I... Oh yes, we were talking about Doctor Monberaux. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt}
  15576: A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt}
  15577: Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt}

  15590: I shall mark her position upon your map so you may locate her more easily once you are in that vicinity.${prompt}
  15591: It is possible to check who has been marked on your map by opening the “Map” menu, selecting the “Markers” option, and then scrolling to the right.${prompt}
  15592: Performing a “Wide Scan” from the “Map” menu also allows you to locate people in your vicinity, should that method prove more convenient.${prompt}
  15593: Whether decorated in battle or recently enlisted, all can benefit from trying their hand at Records of Eminence. It is a simple method for participating in Vana'diel's many adventures, and bestows rewards all its own.${prompt}

  15602: Gondebaud is their representative, and he is stationed in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark his location on your map should you desire to make further inquiries.${prompt}
  15603: If you harbor doubts about something I have not yet touched upon, first open the main menu. From there, scroll right to the second page and select the “Help Desk” option.${prompt}

  15670: Thirdly--and of the utmost import--is that you “check” your adversaries before challenging them. It would not do for you to go charging into battle against an enemy who thoroughly outclasses you.${prompt}
  15671: Finally, never forget to check your spoils of war.${prompt}
  15672: Tasks issued by residents of the city for you to complete are called “quests.” Simply fulfill the requirements, such as procuring the desired item, to receive a reward.${prompt}
  15673: On the other hand, orders handed down directly from those involved with the nation's administration are called “missions.” Converse with the guard by the gate for a more detailed explanation.${prompt}
  15674: Open the “Map” option from the main menu, select “Markers,” and then scroll to the right. That will tell you where you need to go.${prompt}

  16000: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  16001: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  16002: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  16003: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  16004: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  16005: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  16006: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  16007: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  16008: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  16009: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  16010: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  16011: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  16012: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  16013: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  16014: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  16015: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  16016: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  16017: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  16018: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  16019: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  16020: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16021: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  16022: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  16023: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  16024: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  16025: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  16026: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  16027: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  16028: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  16029: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  16030: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  16031: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  16032: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  16033: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16034: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  16035: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  16036: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  16037: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  16038: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  16039: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  16040: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  16041: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  16042: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  16043: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  16044: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  16045: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  16046: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'

  16051: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  16052: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  16053: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}

  16403: I assume she has also rated your technique as highly as I do. Yes, it is always nice to receive validation, especially from those outside of our own circle.${prompt}
  16404: Shall we begin? First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so please try not to forget it.${prompt}
  16405: 'Let me see... For the necessary ingredients, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16406: 'This particular item is used to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'

  16408: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  16409: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  16410: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  16411: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  16412: That's all it says.${prompt}
  16413: 'Once you have increased the Craftsmanship, come show the shield to me and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'

  16418: Don't tell me you forgot the recipe! Fine. Here it is again. Professionals really only need to hear these things once, you know.${prompt}
  16419: Yes, you really have come a long way and are capable of making all kinds of wonderful things. I'm sure this will be no different.${prompt}
  16420: 'Oh yes... This is exactly what I need to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  16421: 'So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  16422: I can somewhat comprehend the technique to pour the soul of a craftsman into this shield and generate such a thing, but it is still impressive nonetheless.${prompt}
  16423: 'Oh, I''m not sure if this is related, but in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems to have reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16424: 'I don''t surmise it to be much of a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you might need to increase the Craftsmanship again if you ever need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  16425: That is clearly just a hypothetical of course. I mean, you would have to lose the item in order to need to make another one and you're much too responsible to let that happen.${prompt}
  16426: 'Wait, are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  16427: 'I suppose it can''t be helped. Here, I''ll make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  16428: You are better than this. Losing important ingredients is something I expect from an apprentice, not you.${prompt}
  16429: Ahh, I see you've made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a closer look?${prompt}
  16430: This is astonishing. The shape has changed, and I can feel a small surge of power emanating from it. Although, it is clearly still a work in progress.${prompt}
  16431: Yes, I remember her saying that you needed to craft multiple times before it would reach the level you want it to be.${prompt}
  16432: That reminds me, she wanted me to mark the shield when it was done. If I may?${prompt}
  16433: There, that should do it.${prompt}
  16434: Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.${prompt}
  16435: Oh, and please note that I often have deliveries for Wolden-Bolden. I hope you'll help me in my efforts to educate the more junior members of the guild.${prompt}
  16436: Oh, I have been expecting you. She said you might come asking about how to upgrade the shield.${prompt}
  16437: Allow me to tell you the recipe. This is important, so please try to remember it.${prompt}
  16438: Did you get all of that?${prompt}
  16439: 'Now, let me explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16440: 'You crafted while equipping the aspis before to increase its Craftsmanship, right? This is basically the same thing, as you will be equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} this time around.${prompt}'
  16441: However, you will really need to pour your spirit into the shield this time. It seems rather difficult compared to the last one.${prompt}
  16442: 'Once the shield''s Craftsmanship reaches 100%, bring it to me and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'

  16446: That covers the ingredients. I imagine it will take some time to gather them all, but I am positive that you can do it. Good luck.${prompt}
  16447: Well? Did you increase the shield's Craftsmanship?${prompt}
  16448: 'Excellent. I will create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you now.${prompt}'
  16449: Here you go.${prompt}
  16450: 'Look what happened here... It seems creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} lowered the shield''s Craftsmanship rating.${prompt}'
  16451: It would be quite cumbersome to have to create another one, so please take care of it until you are ready to craft with it.${prompt}
  16452: Very well done! So this is what became of those ingredients. It is a shining example of absolute perfection!${prompt}
  16453: In addition, I am feeling a power emanating from the shield that was not present last time. I cannot wait to see what the next upgrade will bring!${prompt}
  16454: Now, I just need to mark the shield for you and we will be finished.${prompt}
  16455: There you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.${prompt}
  16456: How disappointing... Although, it does us no good to worry about it. You can have another try at completing the final objective.${prompt}
  16457: Welcome. Have you come to upgrade your shield? Very well, I shall explain the recipe to you...${prompt}
  16458: Oh, so you've already heard the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt}
  16459: 'I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  16460: Basically, I would like your help with some orders that were placed with our guild. I need you to deliver the products to the customers.${prompt}
  16461: However, you can't just take the items to them because we've been requested to make the products on site.${prompt}
  16462: Some materials and other items are exempt, but basically you need to make all of the items where the customer can see you or they won't be accepted.${prompt}
  16463: Do you think I could ask you to gather the materials needed to make the items?${prompt}
  16464: By the way, we have reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their items on a trial basis, including some you normally can't buy.${prompt}
  16465: Speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. Hopefully it will prove useful for you.${prompt}
  16466: Oh, you should keep in mind that you might not always be able to buy the items you are looking for.${prompt}

  16482: Yes, you should really try to get some rest. I can prepare another job for you after you are feeling better.${prompt}
  16483: Ahh, you are looking much better now. Just in time too, as I have a new job for you.${prompt}
  16484: It is good to see you again. I see you finished the delivery. Thank you for that.${prompt}
  16485: Oh! I see you have finished the last delivery. Thank you for all of your hard work.${prompt}
  16486: 'I always keep my word, so here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} as promised.${prompt}'
  16487: If you ever lose them, you can trade guild points for a replacement.${prompt}
  16488: This process is almost like second nature to me now.${prompt}
  16489: So, this is what the shield looks like this time around...${prompt}
  16490: I am speechless. Would you consider letting me put it on display here in the guild?${prompt}
  16491: Hahaha... I am just joking of course. Our mutual friend seems to think that the next upgrade will unlock the shield's ultimate power. I wonder if she's right...${prompt}
  16492: Oh, before you go, I want you to have something. I think a craftsman of your ability will be able to use this crafting technique capably. Consider it a present from me for all of your hard work.${prompt}
  16493: Welcome. I see you have reached the final upgrade. I have managed to prepare the necessary materials for you.${prompt}
  16494: Allow me to explain how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  16495: 'First, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  16496: I have left them with Wolden-Bolden. In other words, you can obtain them by exchanging crafter points. How many do you have saved so far?${prompt}
  16497: 'You will also need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. For it, you will need to follow the same procedure as before, showing me your shield once its Craftsmanship has reached 100%.${prompt}'
  16498: 'That covers the ingredients. It is exciting to know that you are so close to finishing this process. I am looking forward to seeing the end result.${prompt} '
  16499: That reminds me, Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno is planning to use this, right? Please try not to lose it when making the delivery.${prompt}
  16500: Hm? Is something the matter? You look like you want to ask me something...${prompt}
  16501: Hmm... This item you mention sounds like the one a Tarutaru from Adoulin requested me to make.${prompt}
  16502: So, I apologize, but you are too late. I already sent it off to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  16503: Perhaps you should return to Jeuno and see if it has been delivered yet?${prompt}
  16504: I have no idea how this happened... This is the emblem you were looking for, right? It seems it was just sitting on the shelf here in my shop.${prompt}
  16505: You need this for something? No problem. I originally made it for you anyway. Feel free to do with it as you wish.${prompt}
  16506: Would you look at this!${prompt}
  16507: It looks like you finally finished. It really is quite amazing! I like the way our guild's emblem looks on it too.${prompt}
  16508: I really put my heart and soul into making that emblem! It will serve as the perfect symbol of our guild when you equip the shield.${prompt}
  16509: Although it has nothing to do with you completing the shield, I have prepared a small gift for you. It is a new crafting technique.${prompt}

  16605: |-
    Read the manual?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  16606: Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.${prompt}
  16607: You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).${prompt}
  16608: The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.${prompt}
  16609: The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.${prompt}
  16610: However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.${prompt}
  16611: Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.${prompt}
  16612: If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.${prompt}
  16613: You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.${prompt}
  16614: Now, for an explanation on points.${prompt}
  16615: |-
    You receive points after the completion of each game.
    The points are tallied using units known as mandy.${prompt}
  16616: |-
    If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board.
    In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.${prompt}
  16617: Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).${prompt}
  16618: The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.${prompt}
  16619: Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).${prompt}
  16620: 'They are worth ${number: 0}x and ${number: 1}x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.${prompt}'
  16621: The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.${prompt}
  16622: See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?${prompt}
  16623: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  16624: Can trade mandy for many goodies.${prompt}
  16625: Then I just give one piece of advice.${prompt}
  16626: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
