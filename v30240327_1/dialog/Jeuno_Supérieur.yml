  7153: On dirait qu'il s'est habitué à toi. Il n'a plus du tout peur.${prompt}
  7154: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il semble être à l'aise avec toi.)${prompt}
  7155: Encore un petit effort ! Grâce à toi, il mange plus, et ses plumes ont une lueur plus saine !${prompt}
  7156: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il mange joyeusement.)${prompt}
  7157: Ha ! Je ne l'ai jamais entendu piailler si joyeusement !${prompt}
  7158: 'Oh, désolé. Il ne mangera pas ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Mais il pourrait aimer ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} .${prompt}'
  7159: 'Je suis désolé. Sauf à l’heure des repas, le maître nous gronde quand nous leur donnons ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Je sais... C’est l’intention qui compte.${prompt}'
  7160: Eh bien, on dirait qu’il s’est habitué à toi maintenant !${prompt}
  7161: Bon travail ! Maintenant, tu es un cavalier de chocobo qualifié.${prompt}
  7162: Maintenant que tu peux lire dans l'esprit des animaux, peut-être que tu pourrais devenir un maître des bêtes. Bien sûr, je ne peux pas t'apprendre comment... Tu devras juste t'entraîner.${prompt}
  7163: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l'instant, apporte ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7164: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l'instant, apporte ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7165: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire dans leur esprit... Au moins, nous savons que le dernier propriétaire n'avait pas ce don !${prompt}
  7166: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire dans leur esprit... Au moins, nous savons que le dernier propriétaire n'avait pas ce don !${prompt}
  7167: Si tu peux lire dans leur esprit, tu pourrais avoir ce qu'il faut pour être un maître des bêtes. Mais aucun enseignement ne peut t'aider là... Non monsieur !${prompt}
  7168: En y repensant, je me demande ce qui est arrivé à ce soigneur de chocobos peureux ?${prompt}
  7169: Oh, tu n'as pas entendu ? Il est resté chez lui pour s'occuper de son fils depuis qu'il est tombé malade.${prompt}
  7170: Eh bien, c'est ce qu'il mérite pour avoir si mal traité ses chocobos. Bien fait pour lui !${prompt}
  7171: De quoi parles-tu ? Il était incontrôlable, mais son pauvre petit garçon n'a jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
  7172: Oui, tu as raison. J'ai entendu dire que son enfant était choqué par ce que faisait son père, aussi.${prompt}
  7173: Peut-être que si ce brute était plus doux avec ses chocobos, son enfant irait mieux. Qu'en penses-tu ?${prompt}
  7174: Eh bien, regarde de qui tu parles. Je ne pense même pas que ce soit possible... Ça me fait de la peine pour le gamin, cependant.${prompt}
  7175: Kweh !${prompt}
  7176: Oh, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?${prompt}
  7177: C'était un piaillement triste. Pourquoi es-tu si abattu tout d'un coup ?${prompt}
  7178: Ha-ha ! Il est si docile maintenant.${prompt}
  7179: Je détesterais le voir partir, mais peut-être que le renvoyer serait la meilleure chose pour lui.${prompt}
  7180: Il s'est juste levé et s'est enfui. Nous étions si inquiets. Il est revenu couvert de boue. Mais je me demande où il est allé ?${prompt}
  7181: Eh bien, salut ! Comment ça va, hein ? Tu as l'air en pleine forme ! Alors, qu'est-ce que je...${prompt}
  7182: Maître !${prompt}
  7183: 'Hé, que penses-tu que tu... ${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7184: Regarde, il a peur de toi !${prompt}
  7185: Attends... Il est content de quelque chose. Qu'est-ce que cela peut signifier ?${prompt}
  7186: Te voilà... Merci ! Tu es la raison pour laquelle mon fils s'est rétabli.${prompt}
  7187: Je t'ai battu et fouetté pendant si longtemps. Pourquoi as-tu décidé de m'aider ?${prompt}
  7188: Est-ce que tu me comprends ? Non, je ne peux pas te remercier assez pour tout ce que tu as fait pour moi. Je te remercie sincèrement.${prompt}
  7189: Et toi aussi ! Merci.${prompt}
  7190: Je ne suis plus un maître des bêtes. Mais je parie que tu peux devenir un grand maître des bêtes si tu continues comme ça.${prompt}
  7191: Et je suis désolé de t'avoir dit ces choses avant.${prompt}
  7192: Hé, ne t'en fais pas.${prompt}
  7193: Je ne suis plus digne des chocobos. S'il te plaît, prends soin de lui pour moi.${prompt}
  7194: Tu peux compter sur moi. Il deviendra grand et fort.${prompt}
  7195: Reste là où tu es.${prompt}
  7196: Souviens-toi de mes paroles. Un jour, il reviendra pour son chocobo.${prompt}
  7197: Et le chocobo ira volontiers avec lui. Après tout, c'est un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7198: Tout est bien qui finit bien, non ? Maintenant, tu peux te dire maître des bêtes. Tiens-toi droit, gamin !${prompt}
  7199: Tu peux maintenant devenir un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7200: Oh, mince ! Je veux devenir un maître des bêtes un jour, moi aussi !${prompt}
  7201: Quoi ? Oh, le fils de ce type va mieux ? Eh bien, c'est bon à entendre. J'aimerais bien l'inviter un jour.${prompt}
  7202: On dirait qu'il n'y a personne à la maison.${prompt}
  7203: Salut, Galmut !${prompt}
  7204: Hé, Collet ! Reste là. J'ai presque fini !${prompt}
  7205: D'accord !${prompt}
  7206: L'horloge est toujours parfaitement réglée, grâce à Galmut. Il huile les engrenages chaque jour, sans exception.${prompt}
  7207: Ouf... Alors, comment ça va ? Tu vas à l'école, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7208: Euh, oui... En quelque sorte.${prompt}
  7209: En quelque sorte ? Que veux-tu dire par là ? On dirait que tu séchais les cours !${prompt}
  7210: Ouais... Mais ta voix me met toujours un sourire aux lèvres.${prompt}
  7211: Vraiment ? Eh bien, l'enfance ce n'est pas que des études. N'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7212: ★★★★★★Sonnerie de cloche★★★★★★${prompt}
  7213: Elle est pile à l'heure ! Haha, je suis celui qui entretient cette horloge.${prompt}
  7214: Au début, c'était un travail ennuyeux, mais maintenant je vois à quel point c'est amusant.${prompt}
  7215: Cette horloge a besoin de beaucoup d'attention, sinon elle se dérègle tout de suite. C'est une créature si délicate.${prompt}
  7216: Chaque fois que j'entends sa sonnerie, j'ai l'impression de réveiller cette ville.${prompt}
  7217: Chaque jour, je vois les mêmes personnes passer quand je nettoie les engrenages, et ils s'arrêtent pour me saluer.${prompt}
  7218: Parfois, quand je n'en vois pas un, je commence à m'inquiéter s'il va bien.${prompt}
  7219: J'avais un œil sur une certaine fille...${prompt}
  7220: Jusqu'au jour où je l'ai vue avec un autre gars. Ça fait mal.${prompt}
  7221: Bon, quoi qu'il en soit... Plus je travaillais, plus j'avais l'impression d'aider tout le monde. Cela me rendait heureux.${prompt}
  7222: Je m'amuse trop, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7223: Oui, beaucoup trop !${prompt}
  7224: Hé, je ne te posais pas la question.${prompt}
  7225: Bon, je ferais mieux de rentrer bientôt à la maison. Prends soin de toi !${prompt}
  7226: Ravi de t'avoir rencontré. À demain !${prompt}
  7227: Galmut travaille sur l'horloge. Ne le dérange pas.${prompt}
  7228: J'ai tellement peur de l'école. J'ai dit à Galmut que je pense que tout le monde me déteste. Mais il a dit que cela ne pouvait pas être vrai.${prompt}
  7229: Oh, c'est toi... Désolé, mais je suis en plein milieu de quelque chose. Pourrais-tu revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
  7230: Eh bien, regarde qui est là ! Bienvenue dans mon humble demeure.${prompt}
  7231: J'ai plein de trucs bizarres, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7232: Heh. Ils peuvent être de la ferraille, mais ce sont toutes des choses précieuses qu'une certaine personne m'a données.${prompt}
  7233: Hé, qu'est-ce que tu fais ? C'est mon lit !${prompt}
  7234: Y a-t-il quelqu'un à la maison ?${prompt}
  7235: Tiens donc, le voilà... C'est M. Narihira !${prompt}
  7236: Je vois que tu es toujours en forme.${prompt}
  7237: Haha ! Vous, les jeunes de l'après-guerre, vous n'avez rien à envier à notre génération !${prompt}
  7238: Eh bien, ça fait plaisir de te voir.${prompt}
  7239: Comment va l'horloge, Galmut ?${prompt}
  7240: Je prends bien soin d'elle. Tu ne peux pas entendre sa sonnerie ?${prompt}
  7241: Hein ? Qu'est-ce que tu as dit ? Je plaisante. Bien sûr que je l'entends bien !${prompt}
  7242: Mais j'entends les engrenages peiner un peu. Il est peut-être temps de lui donner un peu d'huile.${prompt}
  7243: Eh bien, tu n'as pas changé d'un poil !${prompt}
  7244: Et je vois que tu as un ami avec toi !${prompt}
  7245: Écoute ici, jeune. Galmut est maintenant un citoyen modèle, mais il était un vrai voyou avant !${prompt}
  7246: Oh non, pas ça encore !${prompt}
  7247: Ohohoho ! Tu te défends, hein ? Quoi qu'il en soit, Galmut est arrivé à Jeuno il y a environ trois ans...${prompt}
  7248: Il est venu dans la grande ville pour faire sa marque. Il travaillait chaque jour du lever au coucher du soleil !${prompt}
  7249: Et quand j'ai enfin eu assez de fric pour ouvrir ma propre boutique...${prompt}
  7250: Je me suis fait escroquer tout ce que j'avais. J'ai perdu jusqu'au dernier gil...${prompt}
  7251: Et ça l'a vraiment secoué ! Il a perdu foi en ses semblables... Fusillant du regard tout le monde comme un chien affamé.${prompt}
  7252: C'est à ce moment-là que M. Narihira m'a offert un emploi dans la tour de l'horloge.${prompt}
  7253: Au début, je pensais qu'il était juste un autre escroc. Mais une fois que j'ai commencé, j'ai vraiment aimé ça.${prompt}
  7254: Tu sais, tu travailles si dur là-dedans que quand tu entends enfin la cloche sonner... Putain, ça résonne jusqu'au cœur !${prompt}
  7255: Et j'étais content de trouver quelqu'un qui prendrait ma place.${prompt}
  7256: Oh oui... J'ai presque oublié !${prompt}
  7257: 'Nous avons besoin de ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. Et avec les bêtes sauvages qui font des ravages, le magasin est presque à court.${prompt}'
  7258: Pas possible, vraiment ? Sans huile, nous...${prompt}
  7259: Peut-être que le Tenshodo en a encore. Je déteste faire affaire avec leur genre, cependant.${prompt}
  7260: 'Moi aussi... Hé, je sais ! Pourrais-tu nous apporter ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7261: Nous t'en serions tellement reconnaissants. Elle est une machine si délicate... Sans cela, j'ai peur qu'elle ne devienne folle !${prompt}
  7262: |-
    Vas-tu les aider ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Pas pour le moment.${prompt}
  7263: Très bien ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
  7264: Tout d'abord, rendez-vous au Tenshodo, ici à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7265: Ah bon ? Eh bien, dis-moi si tu changes d'avis. Nous devons faire quelque chose.${prompt}
  7266: 'Oh, c’est toi. Nous ne pouvons toujours pas trouver ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7267: Monsieur Narihira a dit que le Tenshodo en a. Sans cela, tôt ou tard, les engrenages s'arrêteront !${prompt}
  7268: Qui est là !?${prompt}
  7269: Oh, toi... Merci d'avoir apporté l'huile, mais nous n'en avons plus besoin !${prompt}
  7270: J'ai entendu dire qu'ils vont la démolir et en faire une sorte de grue pour charger les cargos depuis les navires.${prompt}
  7271: Le plan est déjà passé. Il n'y a rien que je puisse faire maintenant !${prompt}
  7272: 'Eh bien, je vais prendre ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Merci d’avoir essayé, ${choice-player-gender}[mon ami/ma chère]. Ceci est pour toi.${prompt}'
  7273: J'essaie de croire en quelque chose, et regarde ce qui arrive !${prompt}
  7274: Galmut, c'est moi ! Tu es là ?${prompt}
  7275: Oh, c'est toi. Où est Galmut ?${prompt}
  7276: Il est sorti, hein ? Et il a entendu parler de l'horloge ? Il a dû être choqué.${prompt}
  7277: 'C’est Galmut pour toi. Regarde, si nous obtenons suffisamment de signatures avec ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, nous pourrions peut-être arrêter le plan !${prompt}'
  7278: 'Ils vont démonter l’horloge. Narihira a dit que nous pourrions obtenir ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} de la Chambre de commerce et d’industrie, mais je ne sais pas ce qu’il veut dire.${prompt}'
  7279: Galmut était tellement choqué. Mais je ne peux rien faire. C'est lui qui me remonte toujours le moral.${prompt}
  7280: Galmut ne sortira pas, peu importe combien je l'appelle. Je me demande ce qui ne va pas...${prompt}
  7281: Mais l'horloge semble fonctionner normalement. Je me demande qui la maintient en marche... C'est l'une des sept merveilles de Jeuno !${prompt}
  7282: Hein ? Tu veux que je signe ? Si ça peut aider Galmut, tu peux compter sur moi !${prompt}
  7283: Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?${prompt}
  7284: Quoi !? Tu as...${prompt}
  7285: J'ai entendu dire que quelqu'un avait lancé une pétition. Mais c'était toi ? Galmut devrait être heureux d'avoir un tel bon ami.${prompt}
  7286: Je me demande où il est parti, de toute façon. Pathétique !${prompt}
  7287: 'Tout le monde est contre moi ! Tout est fini !${wait-animation: 3}${prompt}'
  7288: Monsieur Narihira... Et toi... Que faites-vous ici ?${prompt}
  7289: Tais-toi et écoute pour une fois ! Ton ami ici a rassemblé tellement de signatures que la pétition pour sauver la tour de l'horloge a réussi !${prompt}
  7290: Hein ? Pétition ? Est-ce que cela signifie que ses engrenages continueront de tourner ?${prompt}
  7291: Bien sûr, imbécile ! En ce moment, tu es l'horloge arrêtée.${prompt}
  7292: Tu sais ce que ça veut dire, pas vrai ? Plus de sonneries retentissantes. Tu comprends, mon garçon ?${prompt}
  7293: Monsieur Narihira... Je suis désolé.${prompt}
  7294: Peu m'importe ce que tu ressens !${prompt}
  7295: Tu dois affronter toutes les personnes qui comptent sur cette horloge ! Sans les cloches chaque jour...${prompt}
  7296: 'Argh...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7297: Monsieur Narihira !${prompt}
  7298: Oh, ça va. J'ai juste gardé l'horloge en marche pendant que vous étiez parti. Et parbleu, j'étais plus rouillé qu'elle !${prompt}
  7299: Je ne sais pas comment vous remercier. Personne n'a jamais eu assez d'attention pour me parler franchement.${prompt}
  7300: Hé ! Quel genre d'idiot aime se faire engueuler !?${prompt}
  7301: En plus, je pense qu'il y a quelqu'un d'autre que tu devrais remercier. Ton précieux horloge serait de la ferraille sans ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt}
  7302: Je ne sais pas quoi dire... Ou comment te remercier... Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais ça signifie beaucoup pour moi. S'il te plaît, je veux que tu l'aies.${prompt}
  7303: Je suis tellement reconnaissant. Je veillerai à ce qu'il n'arrive jamais rien à cette horloge, car c'est ce qui unit toutes les personnes.${prompt}
  7304: Je te crois, Galmut.${prompt}
  7305: Eh bien, tu as du pain sur la planche. Au boulot, mon gars !${prompt}
  7306: Salut, Galmut !${prompt}
  7307: Salut, Collet ! Je dois rester et finir... Et est-ce que c'est ${name-player} à côté de toi ? Grâce à toi, je sais à quel point je suis heureux !${prompt}
  7308: Galmut s'est remis dans le bain. Et moi, je me sens mieux aussi ! Hmm, je pense que je vais retourner à l'école encore une fois.${prompt}
  7309: Oh, c'est toi, hein ? Galmut travaille dur comme toujours, grâce à toi. Fais-moi une faveur et viens le voir de temps en temps, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7310: Hmm, peut-être que je pourrais demander à ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle]... Oh, ce n'est rien ! Laisse tomber.${prompt}
  7311: Dites, vous dirigez-vous vers Davoi ?${prompt}
  7312: 'Alors vous aurez besoin de ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Vous ne pouvez pas briser le sceau intérieur sans ça.${prompt}'
  7313: 'Je veux échanger cela contre ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. Qu’est-ce que vous en dites ?${prompt}'
  7314: |-
    Allez-vous me rapporter ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je le ferai pour le blason.
    Pas tout de suite.${prompt}
  7315: D'accord ! Merci ! Vous pouvez trouver des coeurls sur la Plaine de Sauromugue.${prompt}
  7316: Oh, zut ! Eh bien, revenez si vous changez d'avis.${prompt}
  7317: 'Avez-vous trouvé ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ? J’ai entendu dire qu’il y avait des coeurls sur la Plaine de Sauromugue. Faites attention !${prompt}'

  7319: 'Très bien. Voici le ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, comme promis.${prompt}'
  7320: 'Quoi ? Vous voulez savoir ce que je vais faire de ce ${item-singular: 6[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7321: Pour vous dire la vérité, ma sœur ne va pas bien.${prompt}
  7322: Hé, Audia... C’est moi. Tu te souviens ?${prompt}
  7323: 'Je veux de la viande ! Apportez-moi ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, trempée dans du sang rouge vif !${prompt}'
  7324: Vite... Dépêchez-vous ou je vous dévorerai !${prompt}
  7325: D'accord, d'accord... Je t'en ai apporté, alors ne me lance plus ce regard maléfique !${prompt}
  7326: Ahahaha... Cette viande a l'air si délicieuse. La graisse, si parfaitement marbrée !${prompt}
  7327: Aumfch... Mmmm ! Ahh... De la viande fraîche !${prompt}
  7328: Ma sœur était si gentille avant de tomber malade. Elle était tellement impatiente de se marier avec Albrecht.${prompt}
  7329: Mais un jour, après être rentrée d'un pique-nique avec Alista, elle a eu mal à la tête et est restée au lit. Ensuite, elle est devenue comme ça.${prompt}
  7330: Tout le monde dit qu'elle est sous une sorte de malédiction. Albrecht prie au temple tous les jours, espérant un soulagement.${prompt}
  7331: J'ai entendu dire que le blason lèverait la malédiction, mais ça n'a pas fonctionné non plus.${prompt}
  7332: Mais je ne pense pas qu'elle soit maudite du tout ! Elle n'a jamais fait quelque chose de mal pour être maudite comme ça !${prompt}
  7333: Oh, Audia...${prompt}
  7334: Je n'aime pas la montrer comme ça, mais je ne sais plus quoi faire.${prompt}
  7335: Son fiancé, Albrecht, est toujours au temple.${prompt}
  7336: Eh bien ? Des nouvelles ?${prompt}
  7337: |-
    As-tu appris quelque chose sur sa maladie ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Non, rien du tout.
    En fait...${prompt}
  7338: Vraiment ? Eh bien, merci d'avoir essayé.${prompt}
  7339: Ne te donne pas la peine. Je sais que tu essaies juste de me remonter le moral.${prompt}
  7340: Hé, Baudin. Comment va-t-elle ?${prompt}
  7341: Elle est toujours la même, Albrecht.${prompt}
  7342: Vraiment... Eh bien, ce n'est qu'une question de temps, car je prie pour elle chaque jour.${prompt}
  7343: Pas question ! Elle ne va pas s'améliorer !${prompt}
  7344: Baudin, qu'est-ce que tu dis ?${prompt}
  7345: Elle n'a jamais rien fait de mal ! Ça ne peut pas être une malédiction. Tu peux prier autant que tu veux, mais elle ne va pas s'améliorer !${prompt}
  7346: Qu'est-ce qui te prend ? Je reviendrai plus tard. Essaie de te calmer et de reprendre tes esprits avant mon retour.${prompt}
  7347: Baudin, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? Tu étais tellement perdu dans tes pensées que tu ne m'as même pas vu, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7348: Non, ce n'est rien.${prompt}
  7349: D'accord, ça va alors. Alors, comment va-t-elle ?${prompt}

  7353: Oui, j'espère.${prompt}

    J'aimerais savoir quoi faire...
    Si tu trouves jamais un remède pour ma sœur, fais-le moi savoir.${prompt}

  7359: Quoi ? Ça pourrait être un remède ? Merci beaucoup ! Maintenant, dépêche-toi !${prompt}
  7360: Très bien... Audia, tu te sentiras mieux en un rien de temps !${prompt}
  7361: Attends, Baudin ! Ce n'est pas un remède. Ça va la rendre pire !${prompt}
  7362: Albrecht ? Et Alista... Comment le sais-tu ?${prompt}
  7363: Ma sœur me l'a dit.${prompt}
  7364: Je... Je suis tellement désolé. Je savais comment guérir sa maladie.${prompt}
  7365: Quoi !? Que se passe-t-il ?${prompt}
  7366: Quand nous sommes sortis ce jour-là, j'ai vu un fantôme venir et la posséder. Je savais que nous devions l'exorciser...${prompt}
  7367: Je suis désolé. Je ne voulais pas perdre mon frère à cause d'elle.${prompt}
  7368: C'est pourquoi je me suis tu. J'espérais que si Audia ne guérissait jamais, alors mon frère finirait par abandonner un jour.${prompt}
  7369: Mais je me suis trompé. Il l'aime vraiment, vraiment. Maintenant je le sais.${prompt}
  7370: Et je ne pouvais plus voir Audia souffrir. S'il vous plaît, pardonnez-moi !${prompt}
  7371: Je...${prompt}
  7372: Baudin, je veux que tu nous pardonnes tous les deux. Je savais qu'Alista détestait Audia, mais je ne soupçonnais rien.${prompt}
  7373: Même si tu ne nous pardonnes pas, s'il te plaît, donne-lui ceci maintenant !${prompt}
  7374: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Et comment...?${prompt}
  7375: Ça devrait chasser l'esprit. Les monstres là-bas m'ont blessé, mais ma douleur n'est rien comparée à ce qu'Audia a souffert.${prompt}
  7376: Albrecht, Alista... C'est bon. Je vous crois.${prompt}
  7377: Audia, Albrecht s'est aventuré dans la gueule du danger pour trouver un remède pour toi. Maintenant, je veux que tu essaies de te rétablir !${prompt}
  7378: Ngraarrr ! Maudits soyez-vous tous ! Vous l'avez trouvé !? URRRNGAHHH !!!${prompt}
  7379: Uhh... Ouf...${prompt}
  7380: Hein !? Où suis-je... Oh, je suis chez moi ? Qu'est-ce qui... Qu'est-ce qui m'est arrivé ?${prompt}
  7381: Audia !${prompt}
  7382: Baudin, qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Maintenant, maintenant... Ne pleure pas.${prompt}

  7385: Que faites-vous tous ici ? Je ne me souviens de rien !${prompt}
  7386: Pardonne-moi ! S'il te plaît, pardonne-moi !${prompt}

  7388: Quoi ?${prompt}
  7389: Tu viendras vivre avec nous, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7390: Attends... Tu vas vraiment pardonner ce que j'ai fait ?${prompt}
  7391: Bien sûr ! Je pense que je comprends ce que tu ressens.${prompt}
  7392: Je suis tellement désolé, Audia. Je n'aurais jamais dû laisser ça t'arriver.${prompt}
  7393: Baudin...${prompt}
  7394: Et toi, étranger. Je te remercie.${prompt}
  7395: J'ai simplement refusé de faire face à la réalité. J'ai honte...${prompt}
  7396: J'ai oublié que nous devons d'abord faire ce dont nous sommes capables, avant de chercher l'aide divine.${prompt}
  7397: Il y a des moments où nous faisons face à l'adversité, et pourtant nous devons agir.${prompt}
  7398: Grâce à la prière, nous gagnons la force et l'espoir de continuer. Mais ensuite, nous devons passer à l'action !${prompt}
  7399: C'est pour toi. Pour avoir essayé d'aider Audia, et pour m'avoir fait réaliser la vérité. Utilise-le bien !${prompt}
  7400: Baudin, laisse-moi m'occuper d'Audia maintenant. Je ne laisserai plus jamais ce genre de chose lui arriver. Je te le promets !${prompt}
  7401: S'il te plaît, Baudin. Je t'en supplie !${prompt}
  7402: Non, c'est bon ! Je sais que tu peux bien t'occuper d'elle.${prompt}
  7403: Merci, Baudin.${prompt}
  7404: Audia...${prompt}
  7405: Oh, Albrecht...${prompt}
  7406: On dirait qu'elle va bien maintenant. Merci de nous avoir aidés. Ça fait une éternité que je ne l'ai pas vue sourire.${prompt}
  7407: Quoi ? La tour de l'horloge !? Galmut m'a montré l'intérieur une fois. C'était sombre, sale et ça sentait l'huile, mais Galmut la connaissait comme sa poche.${prompt}
  7408: 'Bien sûr que je vais signer ! En plus, voici un secret : Galmut avait un faible pour ma sœur !${prompt}'
  7409: Oh, bonjour. Vous ne trouverez ici que des souvenirs du passé. Les jeunes gens pleins de vie comme vous mourraient d'ennui !${prompt}
  7410: Bonjour. Je viens toujours aider Ilumida. Elle a des problèmes de dos et ne peut vraiment plus vivre seule.${prompt}
  7411: La guerre est peut-être finie, mais la douleur est éternelle. Ilumida a perdu son mari, et des gens comme elle souffrent chaque jour.${prompt}
  7412: Jeuno semble être un endroit animé, mais regardez de plus près et vous trouverez des cicatrices qui persistent. La guerre est vraiment une chose terrible.${prompt}
  7413: Oh, un visiteur ? Que puis-je faire pour vous ?${prompt}
  7414: Je cherche Ilumida. Est-elle ici ?${prompt}
  7415: Je me demande qui cela pourrait être. Excusez-moi, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7416: Pourquoi, c'est Wolfgang ! Entrez, entrez.${prompt}
  7417: Je suis content de voir que vous allez bien. Laissez-moi vous donner le paiement de ce mois-ci.${prompt}
  7418: Merci, comme toujours, Wolfgang. Vous savez à quel point je suis reconnaissante.${prompt}
  7419: Non, c'est ce que mon père voulait.${prompt}
  7420: Je l'apprécie vraiment, cependant. Que diriez-vous de quelque chose à boire ? J'ai du bon thé aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  7421: Merci, Ilumida, mais je dois partir. Peut-être plus tard j'aurai le temps de visiter.${prompt}
  7422: Oh ? C'est dommage. Eh bien, prends soin de toi, Wolfgang !${prompt}
  7423: Toujours à votre service, madame.${prompt}
  7424: Le père de Wolfgang, Brandolf, était aussi un soldat. Il a combattu pour la liberté de Jeuno bien avant le règne de l'archiduc.${prompt}
  7425: Et mon mari servait sous ses ordres. Mais dans les guerres qui ont suivi... Quand il avait à peu près l'âge de Wolfgang...${prompt}
  7426: Son père, Brandolf, est mort des blessures qu'il a reçues au combat. Avant de mourir, il a ordonné que des fonds soient versés à des gens comme moi.${prompt}
  7427: Eh bien, qui suis-je pour faire la leçon à un étranger à ce sujet ? Je suis désolée.${prompt}
  7428: Eh bien, maintenant je suppose que je dois aller annoncer la nouvelle.${prompt}
  7429: Je pensais qu'il y avait une bougie par ici...${prompt}
  7430: Oh, mon Dieu... Il semble que je n'ai plus de bougies !${prompt}
  7431: Pourriez-vous aller au temple en chercher une pour moi ? À mon âge, même les courtes promenades me laissent complètement essoufflée.${prompt}
  7432: |-
    Apporterez-vous ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tout de suite.
    Pas encore.${prompt}
  7433: Oh, quelle âme généreuse ! Je vous attendrai ici.${prompt}
  7434: Oh, bien sûr. Vous devez avoir tant de choses à faire. Je trouverai quelqu'un d'autre.${prompt}
  7435: Je pense que le Temple de la Déesse doit avoir des bougies. Je sais que c'est embêtant, mais pourriez-vous en chercher une ?${prompt}
  7436: Oh, splendide. Maintenant, je peux le dire à mon mari. Et pour vous, voici un petit quelque chose pour votre peine.${prompt}
  7437: Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais je crois que cela vous protègera en temps de besoin. Allez, ne soyez pas timide... Prenez-le !${prompt}
  7438: Cela fait si longtemps que mon mari est mort à la guerre. Cette maison était petite pour nous deux, et elle a toujours semblé si grande avec moi seule.${prompt}
  7439: Eh bien, n'hésitez pas à passer si vous êtes dans le quartier. J'ai toujours une théière prête pour les visiteurs.${prompt}
  7440: Et merci beaucoup. Mon mari doit être très heureux. Ne soyez pas un étranger, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7441: Ha ! Vous perdez votre temps !${prompt}
  7442: J'aide Verena et Fickie à faire pousser des fleurs. Nous les arrosons tous les jours. J'espère vraiment qu'elles vont bientôt fleurir !${prompt}
  7443: Ouais, c'est ça. Aucune chance que des graines de bêtes poussent un jour.${prompt}
  7444: Non, elles pousseront !${prompt}
  7445: Oui, mon père a dit que les bêtes allaient commencer une autre guerre ! Fickie est l'ennemi !${prompt}
  7446: Non ! Fickie est notre amie !${prompt}
  7447: Fickie nous a dit que quand elles fleuriront, cela signifiera que les gens et les monstres peuvent être amis. J'étais surpris d'entendre ça, surtout de la part d'un gobelin !${prompt}
  7448: Je sais qu'elles fleuriront. Je vais les faire pousser.${prompt}
  7449: Tu vas juste les voir se flétrir et mourir.${prompt}
  7450: Salut, Fickie ! Salut, Verena !${prompt}
  7451: Alors, toujours pas de germes, hein ?${prompt}
  7452: Je sais, c'est tellement décevant. Mais je les arrose tous les jours !${prompt}
  7453: Elles ne pousseront jamais.${prompt}
  7454: Arrose-les autant que tu veux. Jamais les graines de Fickie ne germeront ici à Jeuno. Jamais !${prompt}
  7455: Écoute, pourquoi tu ne la fermes pas ! On ne sait jamais avant d'essayer.${prompt}
  7456: Oh ! Tu es toujours du côté de Fickie, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7457: Je pense qu'elles germeront.${prompt}
  7458: Hein ?${prompt}
  7459: Tout le monde me parle maintenant que je les ai plantées. Ça me rend tellement heureux.${prompt}
  7460: Donc, même si les fleurs ne fleurissent jamais, c'était quand même bien.${prompt}
  7461: Fickie...${prompt}
  7462: Peu importe !${prompt}
  7463: Je dois retourner chez Muck. Je vous verrai demain.${prompt}
  7464: Prends soin de toi, Fickblix. Je rentre chez moi aussi.${prompt}
  7465: J'espère qu'elles germeront demain ! Au revoir !${prompt}
  7466: Merci pour tout.${prompt}
  7467: Et merci d'avoir apporté l'engrais, Geebeh.${prompt}
  7468: Peu importe ! Je ne le fais pas pour toi.${prompt}
  7469: Depuis que Fickie est parti, je ne vois plus Verena. Même les gars de Tenshodo ne me parlent plus.${prompt}
  7470: C'est un perdant ! Il s'est enfui avant que les fleurs ne fleurissent du tout ! Ce n'est pas juste !${prompt}
  7471: Je vous dis de germer ! Vous êtes nos fleurs ! Les nôtres et celles de Fickie ! Alors, germez, bon sang !${prompt}
  7472: Attends, Geebeh. Regarde ça !${prompt}
  7473: Oh, quoi maintenant ? Est-ce que... c'est une pousse ? Ça germe ?${prompt}
  7474: C'est ça, Geebeh ! Tu ne peux pas le dire juste en regardant, mais ça a commencé à germer sous la terre !${prompt}
  7475: Nous avons planté ces graines ! Nous et Fickie ! Et maintenant elles germent !${prompt}
  7476: Donne ça à Verena. Dis-lui que les fleurs que nous avons plantées avec Fickie ont commencé à germer !${prompt}
  7477: Je suis sûr qu'elles vont fleurir en grand !${prompt}
  7478: J'espère que nous pourrons planter beaucoup de graines, et que les gens et les monstres pourront s'entendre, comme Fickie l'a dit.${prompt}

  7693: Pourrait-ce être !? Pourtant, elles sont sales et rouillées, mais l'artisanat ! En effet, ce sont les œuvres de Borghertz !${prompt}

  7696: Un dispositif mystérieux la maintenait fermée ; personne ne pouvait l'ouvrir !${prompt}
  7697: Même s'il contenait un outil magique, je doute que quiconque ait les compétences pour réparer ces gantelets.${prompt}

    Régions sous le contrôle des bêtes.${prompt}
  7762: Toutes les trois nations s'efforcent quotidiennement de mettre plus de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les “conquêtes”. Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en vainquant des ennemis lorsque vous avez le Sceau de votre nation.${prompt}
  7763: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui se débarrasse du plus grand nombre de monstres dans ces zones prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  7764: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  7765: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}
  7766: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans les avant-postes des régions sous notre contrôle.
    Ils sont là pour lancer le Sceau sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  7767: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez obtenir des cristaux des ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
  7768: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez également des points de conquête. Vous obtiendrez plus de points de conquête si vous battez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  7769: |-
    Vous voyez donc... les conquêtes bénéficient aux nations et aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
  7770: |-
    Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant “Info Région” dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}

  7779: Lorsque les résultats des conquêtes sont annoncés, vous saurez quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les bêtes peuvent prendre le contrôle de régions.${prompt}
  7780: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières seront placés dans ses avant-postes pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  7781: Des marchands seront également placés là-bas, et des biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les boutiques locales ici.${prompt}
  7782: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base derrière les conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun d'entre vous fasse de son mieux, et amène notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
  7783: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions face à d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les prochains résultats des conquêtes soient annoncés.${prompt}
  7784: En guise d'incitation, nous vous accorderons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  7785: Mais si nous sommes alliés avec un autre pays, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous accorderons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions du pays classé en tête.${prompt}
  7786: |-
    Notre préoccupation principale réside dans les bêtes prenant le contrôle de nos régions.

    The minstrel of melodies is my name,
    For a mere ${number: 6} gil I'd recall your past.
    But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame,
    So until that time, my kind offer will last.${prompt}
  8091: Now close your eyes...${prompt}
  8092: Good day, young adventurer. Would you mind having a spot of tea with an old woman? I could use some company.${prompt}
  8093: You see this small chest? It was given to me by my late husband, Goddess bless his soul.${prompt}
  8094: But look at it. It is fairly old, the craftsmanship is not that remarkable, and on top of that, it is locked. Not the kind of gift you would think of giving a loved one, eh? Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  8095: This is the only present I ever got from my husband. I can still remember the day he gave it to me... “Here.” That is all he said... He never was good with words.${prompt}
  8096: But I still treasure this chest with my life... You must think I am crazy to hold on to something so useless for so long.${prompt}
  8097: Excusey-woozy me. Is anybody-buddy home?${prompt}
  8098: Oh, and who might you be, my little friend?${prompt}
  8099: My name is Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru. I am the proprietor of the most reliable-viable astrological services in all of Jeuno.${prompt}
  8100: I came here today to ask a favor. I was wondering if you would be willing to part with that chestaru.${prompt}
  8101: What?${prompt}
  8102: I've heard rumors from my customers that a strange-wangey oldy-moldy chest is in your possession. I sense that the chest you hold may be magical.${prompt}
  8103: There is a legend that states how once, long ago, a shy, timid god constructed a box to help him convey-away his true feelings to his love. He filled the box with the words he could not speak, and sent it to her.${prompt}

  8107: Once open, the promise of true love will be fulfilled...or so says the legend.${prompt}
  8108: I need that chestaru to tell Chulu...to tell my longtime friend how I feely-wheely about her. I want to fill it with my feelings.${prompt}
  8109: Why don't you just tell her yourself?${prompt}
  8110: I...I can'taru!${prompt}
  8111: And you mean to tell me...you've never opened the chestaru?${prompt}
  8112: That is correct. It was a gift from my husband...${prompt}

    Travel to the Boyahda Tree?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8118: What a kind young ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lady] you are. I appreciate that you would take on such a dangerous task for a feeble old woman.${prompt}
  8119: But to think that my husband would leave me such a gift...${prompt}
  8120: Oh well, I guess it was too much to ask of you...${prompt}
  8121: 'Ah, ${name-player}. You have come back. I know that it is asking a lot, but could you find it in your heart to assist me in finding the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that Kurou-Morou spoke of?${prompt}'
  8122: 'According to our little friend, there is a place deep within the Boyahda Tree where the moonlight penetrates the leaves. Once you have arrived at that spot, offering a prayer to the gods is the only way to obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'

  8126: Nothing has happened? Nothing has happened!? But the legend said...${prompt}
  8127: The legend was just a legend. Maybe we were foolish to believe...${prompt}
  8128: So there was nothing in the box?${prompt}
  8129: |-
    ...?
    What is this?
    It looks like a note. Wait, this is my husband's handwriting!${prompt}

    My dear Ilumida,
      I don't know why I am writing this.
      You know I have never been good at
      telling you how I feel.${prompt}
  8131: |2-
      Many a time I have tried to put
      into words my love for you, but
      those words never seemed to make
      their way out.${prompt}
  8132: |2-
      Drinking tea together on an autumn
      morning, or resting in the shade on a
      summer afternoon...it was the little
      things that brought me happiness.${prompt}
  8133: |2-
      As much as I would like to throw away
      everything and spend all my time with
      you, the situation in Vana'diel now
      will not let me.${prompt}
  8134: |2-
      I wish that I could be by your side
      when you read this letter, but that may
      not be what destiny has in store for me.
      I must tell you how I feel now.${prompt}
  8135: "  \n  I love you.\n  ${prompt}"
  8136: |2-
      To this day I regret never saying
      these words to you, and I beg that
      one day you will forgive me.

  8137: |-
    The date...
    This is dated the day before he went off to the war...${prompt}
  8138: All that time, he just wanted to say...${prompt}
  8139: My little friend. I think I can understand what you are going through.${prompt}
  8140: |-
    Here.
    Take this chest.${prompt}
  8141: R-really?${prompt}
  8142: Of course. I no longer require it. I have already received its true gift.${prompt}
  8143: If you truly care about this girl, avoid doing things that you will regret later. Women do not care about how fancy the delivery is. If you really mean what you say, she'll know it.${prompt}
  8144: Whether you use that box or not is for you to decide.${prompt}
  8145: Th...thank you. But I think I won't be needing it.${prompt}
  8146: Your story has given me the courage to tell Chululu how I feel. Thank you, Ma'am.${prompt}
  8147: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}. Take this--and some gil--as a reward. I was going to use them to acquire the chest anyway-away.
    Well, I'm off to my shop. Ta-taru!${prompt}
  8148: |-
    Thank you again for all of your help.
    Those words my husband left me still echo in my mind... It is as if he were here in this room, standing with me now...${prompt}
  8149: Our little friend was able to express his feelings to his girlfriend? I knew that he would do the right thing.${prompt}
  8150: I would like to sit down and have a cup of tea with that Chululu. I'm sure we would have a great deal to chat about...${prompt}
  8151: Wow, where did you get all those calluses on your hands?${prompt}
  8152: From practicing with your axe?${prompt}
  8153: That's pretty impressive, but I still don't think you could match my boss over there. He rounded up our chocobos and built this whole stable, all with a single axe.${prompt}
  8154: Why, he could take out the deadliest of monsters with a single swipe!${prompt}
  8155: Osker! Stop your gabbing and get back to work! Our chocobos are starving over there!${prompt}
  8156: I-I'm sorry, boss. I was just admiring this adventurer's hands. They look like they could wield an axe real good.${prompt}
  8157: Look. They've got calluses all over them, just like yours!${prompt}
  8158: |-
    You know, you're right...
    ${name-player}, it looks like you know your axe pretty well. If it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to ask you a favor.${prompt}
  8159: The other day, the leader of that Tenshodo outfit paid us an unexpected visit...${prompt}
  8160: He said he was interested in going into the axe business, but wasn't sure about which one he wanted to sell in his shop. He asked me to test two new models...but I'm busy enough with the stables and don't have any extra time to go out slicing and dicing.${prompt}
  8161: If you're not too busy, would you mind trying one out? You can think of it as polishing your skills.${prompt}
  8162: |-
    How about it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Okay, I'll help you out.
    I'm sorry...${prompt}
  8163: |-
    That's great!
    Here, take her. I already got somebody to try out the other one.${prompt}
  8164: Now go out and test that girl until she's as blunt as a chocobo girl. When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, bring her back to me and we'll continue from there. Got it?${prompt}
  8165: Yeah, you look like a busy ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]. Can't expect somebody to help you out when there's nothing in it for them...${prompt}
  8166: When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, show her to me, and I'll decide if we're to continue or not. Or are you here on other business?${prompt}
  8167: |-
    What do you want?
    ${selection-lines}
    I've lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    I'm tired of testing the axe.
    Nothing at all.${prompt}
  8168: You've what? Oh well, the Tenshodo guy gave me a box full of these axes, so I could care less if you used 'em to shave your cat's whiskers.${prompt}
  8169: Here, take another one. But you know this means that you're going to have to start all over now, right?${prompt}
  8170: Don't tell me that you're throwing in the towel? C'mon now. I've got a lot of work to do, and there aren't many kind folk out there that would help an old cowboy like me.${prompt}
  8171: |-
    Really throw in the towel?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  8172: I knew you'd come through for me, ${name-player}. Now get out there and get chopping! Take your time if you're busy with your other adventuring.${prompt}
  8173: Boy, you young folk these days have no respect. You give somebody your word, and then you go back on it like it don't mean nothing at all.${prompt}
  8174: I guess I'll just have to find somebody else to help me out. Now take that axe of yours and skedaddle.${prompt}
  8175: I don't know... I don't think I can decide yet. Whack up a few more monsters and then bring her back here for another look.${prompt}
  8176: Well, I'll be! You've worked this axe so hard that I could whack Osker over the head with it and he wouldn't even get a scratch. Now I think I'll be able to decide on which axe I recommend to the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8177: To tell you the truth, ${name-player}, I didn't think you'd be able to handle the test. I'm really impressed. To show my true gratification, how'd you like to put your axe-wielding skills to a real test?${prompt}
  8178: Back when I was still a blazin' young'un, me and my partners used to compete over who was the strongest of our pack. There was no real meaning to it, but it was fun and helped us build up our confidence on the battlefield.${prompt}
  8179: And after a few of those sessions, I could feel my skills getting more and more refined, until I was smashing through anything that got in my path.${prompt}
  8180: 'Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you''re there, all you have to do is find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Bring it back to me, and you''re done. Sounds easy, but you''d better go well prepared. I''ve seen more than a few buddies get their hides tanned by the beast that lives in that place.${prompt}'
  8181: 'Take that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you''re there, find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} and bring it back to me...but be careful now, hear?${prompt}'
  8182: Ha hah! You dog, you! I can tell by the grin on your face that you kicked that monster in the be-hind!${prompt}
  8183: 'But enough with the small talk! Let''s take a look at that there ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8184: Whoa! I wish I could be as strong as you and my boss someday! No, someday I will be as strong as you. You just wait and see!${prompt}
  8185: '...I take my hat off to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8186: As long as there are hard-hittin' white knuckled ${choice-player-gender}[men/ladies] like you out there, Vana'diel won't have to worry about no beastmen or no Shadow Lords.${prompt}
  8187: Now it's time to get back to work. Osker! Stop your dilly-dallying!${prompt}
  8188: More work? I'll never get a chance to practice my axe!${prompt}
  8189: Oh, quit your whining. One of my acquaintances should be here any minute.${prompt}
  8190: Acquaintance? Wow, I didn't think you had any friends, boss.${prompt}
  8191: You just shut your trap, Osker, or I'll glue it shut!${prompt}
  8192: Hello there, Brutus. I've brought back the axe you had me testing. It's a fine piece of work, but the head's a little too heavy for my taste.${prompt}
  8193: Anyway, Brutus, do you remember what day it is today?${prompt}
  8194: What day it is? Of course I do! One look on the calendar over there and...${prompt}
  8195: Don't tell me you forgot that today was the day you'd let me ride my old chocobo?${prompt}
  8196: |-
    Ha ha ha! I had you going there for a while, didn't I? Of course I remember.
    You did a good job with that girl. All the folks over here at the stables rave about how she's been the easiest to work with.${prompt}
  8197: The adventurers do, too! They say she's the most obedient chocobo they've ever ridden.${prompt}
  8198: Heh heh. They didn't say that, did they?${prompt}
  8199: Would I lie to you? You've become one helluva beastmaster, if you ask me.${prompt}
  8200: Her wounds are still not fully healed, but I don't think that a quick ride around the Duchy would hurt. Go on!${prompt}
  8201: Thanks again, Brutus.${prompt}
  8202: But you know...I'm still worried that she won't trust me riding her yet...you know, after all that I put her through...${prompt}
  8203: Are you still fretting over that? Come on, take a look at her eyes.${prompt}
  8204: They're shining as bright as yours, Dietmund.${prompt}
  8205: Brutus...${prompt}
  8206: Hey, hey! You're not going get all sissy on me now, are you!?${prompt}
  8207: I-I-I don't know what t-to say. I think I've g-got something in me eye...${prompt}
  8208: If all you're going to do is stand there and cry, the get the hell out of my stables! You're scaring away business!${prompt}
  8209: Th-thank you, Brutus...${prompt}
  8210: No, thank you, everyone. I'll never forget this day...never...${prompt}
  8211: You have learned the weapon skill “Decimation”!${prompt}
  8212: |-
    See, Dietmund came back, just like I told you. I could tell it from his eyes.
    People ain't that different from chocobos, you know. You can always tell what they're thinking by taking a gander at their baby blues, or blacks, or whatever color they may be.${prompt}
  8213: |-
    It won't be long before this girl goes home to her master...
    But you won't see me crying! Mr. Dietmund promised me that I could ride her whenever I wanted!${prompt}
  8214: The chocobo looks extremely happy.${prompt}
  8215: Comment va-t-il ? ${prompt}
  8216: Eh bien, il ne semble pas y avoir de blessures externes. Pour tout te dire, je ne sais pas exactement ce qui ne va pas chez lui. ${prompt}
  8217: |-
    Tu ne sais pas exactement ?
    Alors tu as quelque sorte de théorie ? ${prompt}

  8221: Wolfgang, qu'est-il réellement arrivé dans cette salle ? Qu'était ce dispositif, et que tentaient de faire les scientifiques de Jeuno avec cela ? Tu sais quelque chose, n'est-ce pas ? ${prompt}
  8222: Tu n'as pas à te soucier des affaires du Duché. ${prompt}
  8223: |-
    Je vois... Je suppose que certaines choses sont mieux laissées inconnues.
    Je me demande souvent s'il faut informer un patient lorsque sa maladie est incurable. Cependant, s'il reste même un fil d'espoir pour guérir cette maladie... ${prompt}
  8224: Si tu essaies de dire que Jeuno est malade, tu te trompes complètement. ${prompt}
  8225: |-
    <Soupir>
    Permettez-moi de reformuler ma question. ${prompt}
  8226: Entre amis, que s'est-il réellement passé ce jour-là ? ${prompt}
  8227: '... Je... je ne sais vraiment pas. C''est pourquoi il est crucial que nous interrogions ce garçon. ${prompt}'

    Attendez.
    Peut-être savez-vous quelque chose de ce qui s'est passé près de la Mer de Shu'Meyo. Récemment, j'ai entendu d'étranges rumeurs... ${prompt}
  8231: Docteur Monberaux, il y a beaucoup de mouvement à l'extérieur de l'infirmerie. Pensez-vous que les Gardes ducales sont revenus ? ${prompt}
  8232: Ces égoïstes ! Pensent-ils à autre chose qu'à leur propre gain ? ${prompt}
  8233: Je m'excuse, mais il y a quelque chose que je dois d'abord régler. ${prompt}
  8234: Et nous ne pouvons obtenir aucune réponse sans que le garçon soit réveillé et sous surveillance ! Remettez-le-nous ! C'est un ordre ! ${prompt}

  8242: |-
    Je ne comprends pas. Aucun signe de conscience depuis des heures, et puis il se réveille soudainement et s'enfuit...
    Il doit y avoir une explication à cela... ${prompt}
  8243: Je suis désolé que vous ayez dû assister à cet échange. J'aimerais vous informer davantage sur ce qui vient de se passer, mais même moi, je suis perplexe face aux événements d'aujourd'hui. ${prompt}
  8244: |-
    Vous allez bien ?
    Vous avez l'air légèrement pâle. ${prompt}
  8245: Eh bien, j'espère que ce n'est rien de grave. ${prompt}
  8246: |-
    Cet amulette que vous tenez. Elle appartient au garçon, n'est-ce pas ?
    Comment cela ? Vous dites qu'il vous l'a donnée ? ${prompt}
  8247: Je vous suggère de la garder. Elle pourrait nous donner des indices sur ce qui se passe réellement. Elle pourrait aussi... ${prompt}
  8248: '... Peu importe. ${prompt}'
  8249: |-
    Peut-être devrais-je commencer ma tournée dans les Jardins de Ru'Lude. Je pourrais collecter des informations précieuses.
    J'ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut est encore plus tendue qu'ici... ${prompt}
  8250: |-
    D'un point de vue médical, c'est un miracle que le garçon se soit réveillé.
    Je ne peux pas l'expliquer... ${prompt}
  8251: Pourquoi Wolfgang a-t-il besoin de parler avec lui si désespérément ?${prompt}
  8252: Peut-être devriez-vous visiter les Jardins de Ru'Lude. J'ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut pourrait être encore plus tendue qu'ici.${prompt}
  8253: Une connaissance du patient qui vient d'être admis ?${prompt}
  8254: C'est exact. Où est-elle !?${prompt}
  8255: Ah, vous connaissez également le patient ? Vous pouvez accompagner ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8256: Cependant, je dois vous prévenir. Son état est encore assez instable. Il semble qu'elle souffre terriblement...${prompt}
  8257: Prishe !${prompt}
  8258: Attendez, vous êtes...${prompt}
  8259: Vous deux vous connaissez ? Ce noble guerrier est celui qui a amené notre princesse inconsciente.${prompt}
  8260: Sir Tenzen... l'aventurier, ${name-player}, semble également connaître le patient.${prompt}
  8261: |-
    Prishe...
    Quel funeste destin t'a-t-il frappée... ?${prompt}
  8262: '... Gardien...${prompt}'
  8263: Prishe ?${prompt}
  8264: '... de l’... Apocalypse...${prompt}'
  8265: Gardien de l'Apocalypse ? De quoi parlez-vous ?${prompt}
  8266: '!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8267: |-
    M'appeler...
    ... Arrêtez !
    ... Éloignez-vous !${prompt}
  8268: N-non... !
  8269: Son amulette ! Elle a disparu !${prompt}
  8270: Toi ! N'as-tu pas vu une amulette autour du cou de ma chère amie ? Sans elle, elle...${prompt}
  8271: Je m'excuse, mademoiselle, mais quand je l'ai trouvée, elle était sans cette amulette dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  8272: Impossible...${prompt}
  8273: Attendez ! ${name-player}, pourriez-vous me montrer votre amulette ?${prompt}
  8274: |-
    J'ai le sentiment que les deux pourraient être liés d'une manière ou d'une autre.
    S'il vous plaît ! C'est peut-être le seul moyen de sauver Prishe !${prompt}
  8275: |-
    L'état du patient s'est stabilisé. Cependant, elle ne montre aucun signe de réveil du profond sommeil dans lequel elle est tombée.
    En toutes mes années en tant que médecin, je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel...${prompt}
  8276: ${name-player}, pensez-vous vraiment que tout cela ait un lien avec cette amulette ?${prompt}
  8277: Si seulement le mystérieux garçon qui l'a laissée était encore là, il pourrait nous aider à éclaircir la situation dans laquelle nous nous trouvons...${prompt}
  8278: Un garçon... ? Vous ne voulez pas dire le même garçon que la Garde Ducal recherche, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8279: Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ? Avez-vous aussi entendu les rumeurs sur l'étrange jeune homme qui a disparu il y a des jours ?${prompt}
  8280: Lors de ma visite au palais, on m'a parlé d'un certain garçon dangereux.${prompt}
  8281: Je vois... Donc ce garçon portait avec lui une amulette similaire à celle de la fille. C'est peut-être pourquoi elle a été attaquée...${prompt}
  8282: Mais, l'amulette de Prishe lui a été donnée par le Cardinal Mildaurion. Il est absurde de penser que le cardinal pourrait être associé à des criminels !${prompt}
  8283: Le Cardinal Mildaurion de la Cathédrale Tavnazienne ?${prompt}
  8284: Oui. Il y a longtemps, le cardinal a donné l'amulette à Prishe après qu'elle ait été gravement blessée dans un accident. Elle a dit que c'était pour la protéger.${prompt}
  8285: |-
    Depuis ce jour, elle n'a jamais été sans l'amulette.
    Mais pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait la voler... ?${prompt}
  8286: Peut-être que c'est le garçon qui a volé l'amulette du patient. Cependant, il y a seulement quelques jours, j'ai entendu dire que le garçon avait été vu récemment dans les ruines de Pso'Xja, situées profondément dans les redoutées Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8287: Quoi !? Êtes-vous sûr !?${prompt}
  8288: Un soldat que j'ai traité pour hypothermie a mentionné que son groupe l'avait vu seul dans les ruines. Quand la Garde Ducal a appris cela, ils sont partis pour les Terres du Nord sur-le-champ.${prompt}
  8289: |-
    Donc le quatrième cristal se trouve dans les ruines de Pso'Xja...
    Je n'ai pas de temps à perdre.${prompt}
  8290: Attendez !${prompt}
  8291: Avant de partir pour votre voyage, je dois vous informer que les ruines sont contrôlées par une organisation connue sous le nom de Tenshodo. Vous devriez probablement consulter avec eux d'abord.${prompt}
  8292: |-
    Je vois...
    Merci pour ces informations.
    Bonne journée, Docteur !${prompt}
  8293: Je me demande s'il pourrait y avoir un lien entre le garçon et cette jeune dame, Prishe.${prompt}
  8294: Selon les rumeurs parmi la Garde Ducal, quelqu'un l'a vu dans la tour centrale des ruines nordiques de Pso'Xja. Cependant, pour entrer dans les parties les plus profondes de ces tours, la permission du Tenshodo est nécessaire...${prompt}
  8295: Vous dites que vous connaissez la jeune fille Elvaan qui s'est effondrée ici ?${prompt}
  8296: |-
    Un voyageur étrangement habillé de l'Est l'a emmenée à la clinique du Docteur Monberaux.
    Oh, j'espère vraiment qu'elle va bien.${prompt}
  8297: Contrairement aux rumeurs désagréables qui se répandent dans les rues du Duché, la jeune fille Elvaan qui s'est effondrée ici n'a pas été attaquée par un assaillant louche.${prompt}
  8298: Alors qu'elle était à genoux devant la statue de la Déesse pour offrir une prière, elle s'est soudainement effondrée par terre et a commencé à convulser violemment. J'ai essayé de purifier son âme des terribles démons qui la possédaient ; cependant, mon eau bénite n'a eu aucun effet.${prompt}
  8299: J'espère que mes prières pour sa sécurité atteindront rapidement la Déesse.${prompt}
  8300: |-
    ...
    J-je m'excuse. Je n'ai pas été moi-même depuis que la jeune fille Elvaan a eu son...accident.${prompt}
  8301: Je sais que Mère Chiphraix insiste sur le fait qu'il n'y a pas eu de jeu trouble, mais je pourrais jurer avoir ressenti une présence sombre derrière la fille avant qu'elle ne s'effondre.${prompt}
  8302: Et maintenant, chaque fois que j'y pense, je deviens étourdi et confus...${prompt}
  8303: Si vous êtes ici pour voir la jeune fille, elle est éveillée depuis quelques heures déjà.${prompt}
  8304: De quoi parlez-vous !? Il n'y a aucune façon que le cardinal aurait...${prompt}
  8305: Je sais, mais même si c'était le cas, je suis certain qu'il y a une explication raisonnable.${prompt}
  8306: Oh, ${name-player}. Je ne peux pas commencer à exprimer ma gratitude pour vous avoir sauvé Prishe.${prompt}
  8307: Elle m'a informé de ce qui s'est passé ce jour-là.${prompt}
  8308: Possédée par une bête inconnue à l'intérieur de son propre rêve...${prompt}
  8309: Vous et Tenzen avez réussi à la ramener. Cependant, nous ne savons toujours pas ce qu'est devenue l'amulette qu'elle portait.${prompt}
  8310: Je sens que les événements des derniers jours ne sont que la partie émergée de l'iceberg.${prompt}
  8311: ${name-player}, y a-t-il quelque chose de plus que vous pouvez nous dire ?${prompt}
  8312: C'est la question que nous devrions vous poser !${prompt}
  8313: Quels sont vos liens avec ce criminel que moi, le Duché, et ${name-player} recherchons ?${prompt}
  8314: The boy who has constantly eluded the Ducal Guard--where is he hiding?${prompt}
  8315: Prishe, you must answer me. Why was that boy with you, and where has he disappeared to!?${prompt}
  8316: |-
    Hell if I know...
    But there is one thing that I can say: I don't care if he's on the top of Jeuno's most wanted list. If it weren't for him saving my butt, I'd be pushing up lilacs in the necropolis.${prompt}
  8317: Anyway, it's not the boy I'm worried about. What are you going to do about that monster in my dream!? You said you knew what it was, right?${prompt}
  8318: Come on! Spill it, old man! Why is that thing after me!?${prompt}
  8319: Diabolos... Terrestrial avatar of dreams...${prompt}
  8320: Terrestrial avatar...?${prompt}
  8321: The terrestrial avatars are the five powerful gods born of Vana'diel and entrusted to protect her.${prompt}
  8322: Many eons ago, the five avatars fought a fierce battle with an evil presence that attempted to envelop and suffocate our world.${prompt}
  8323: There is the fiery bird of resurrection, Phoenix, whom the blade I carry at my side has been blessed by.${prompt}
  8324: And then there is the ruler of dreams, Diabolos; the guardian of the moon, Fenrir; the bringer of rainbows, Carbuncle; and the conqueror of the skies, Bahamut...${prompt}
  8325: Ba-Bahamut!?${prompt}
  8326: |-
    You have heard of the legend of Bahamut?
    It just so happens that I have traveled across many malms of ocean to this continent in order to meet Bahamut--and request his assistance in stopping the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8327: '!!!${prompt}'
  8328: Now that you mention it, when I went to Cape Riverne, I do remember Bahamut saying something about a keeper of some sorts...${prompt}
  8329: Keeper of the Apocalypse... Prishe! Those are the words you spoke while you were unconscious!${prompt}
  8330: |-
    All I remember is that before you guys arrived, that monster Diabolos talked about a song that sang of the keeper.
    What was it called...? “Memoria de la S^tona”?${prompt}
  8331: The memory of the crystal...${prompt}
  8332: He also said that when the keeper arrives, “our pact will be fulfilled.” Whatever that means...${prompt}
  8333: And that's why he told me to see Bahamut as soon as possible...${prompt}
  8334: |-
    “Our pact”...
    What could he have meant...?${prompt}
  8335: Beats me, and I don't plan on going back there to ask him.${prompt}
  8336: But I have a feeling that Bahamut could fill us in on the details. That's why we've got to get back to Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8337: Back to Tavnazia? You mean to tell me that you have come from the Marquisate?${prompt}
  8338: That is correct. However, we were teleported here by Bahamut when we tried to speak with him...${prompt}
  8339: What an excellent turn of events!${prompt}
  8340: It just so happens that I have requested transport to Tavnazia from the leader of the Tenshodo, Aldo. If it is possible, I would like you two to join me and help me find Bahamut!${prompt}
  8341: So you're the guy Aldo was talking about...${prompt}
  8342: Well, I guess the more the merrier, right? We'll meet you at the Tenshodo when you're ready to go.${prompt}
  8343: Understood!${prompt}
  8344: Oh, and you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8345: I'll be holding on to this amulet for just a little while longer. You got a problem with that?${prompt}
  8346: Hey, and when you're finished with your business here, why don't you come back to Tavnazia? You know the way, right?${prompt}
  8347: See ya around!${prompt}
  8348: 'You lend the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Prishe.${prompt}'
  8349: |-
    I'm delighted to see my young patient fully recovered.
    She's awfully energetic when conscious, isn't she?${prompt}
  8350: |-
    It appears our visitors have returned to Tavnazia.
    I admit being most surprised to hear the nation still existed.${prompt}
  8351: ${name-player}, it seems as if you have experienced a trying ordeal in the Northlands.${prompt}
  8352: I have attempted to gather information from the Ducal Guard; however, none are willing--or should I say allowed--to speak of the matter, though the fear in their eyes tells much.${prompt}
  8353: |-
    And that is not all...
    Recently there have been unsettling rumors that the end of the world is near.${prompt}
  8354: Those rumors also say that the young patient that I treated--the girl who had her amulet stolen--is connected with all this in some matter.${prompt}
  8355: I have even heard that the Ducal Guard has a warrant out for her arrest...${prompt}
  8356: Preposterous! Lady Prishe is simply being used. The true criminal is that boy!${prompt}
  8357: Why, if it is not...${prompt}
  8358: I apologize for my sudden entrance, Doctor.${prompt}
  8359: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Something terrible is underway!${prompt}
  8360: I have come from the Grand Duke Palace, where I heard of the Duchy's ridiculous plan. Jeuno has begun to mobilize the Ducal Guard in preparation for an attack on...Bahamut!${prompt}
  8361: Yes, Bahamut has threatened Vana'diel with the promise of apocalypse. However, he is still one of the terrestrial avatars bound to protect our world.${prompt}
  8362: There must be some way to persuade the conqueror of the skies...and that is why I requested to accompany the commander of this operation, Lady Esha'ntarl. Unfortunately...${prompt}
  8363: '...the commander was not one to listen to reason. She is convinced that it would be futile to try and communicate with Bahamut, and the only way to save the people of Vana''diel is to attack the Wyrmking and his minions before they attack our cities.${prompt}'
  8364: Excuse me, sir. I am not sure if I fully comprehend what you are trying to say.${prompt}
  8365: Bahamut is readying to launch an attack on the four nations? That cannot be true!${prompt}
  8366: But if it was...${prompt}
  8367: Have the leaders of the nations been informed? Have their armies begun preparations?${prompt}
  8368: Unfortunately, San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst more than likely remain oblivious to the situation at hand. And even if they did know, they would have no means of mounting a counterattack.${prompt}
  8369: Bahamut is known as the conqueror of the skies for a reason. The power he and his minions possess is beyond anything we could imagine--the power to control time and space.${prompt}
  8370: Control time and space...?${prompt}
  8371: The moment he and his minions were to arrive above our cities would be the moment of our defeat. We would have no choice but to accept annihilation...${prompt}
  8372: '...${prompt}'
  8373: But I feel there is still a way...${prompt}
  8374: Lady Esha'ntarl mentioned that Bahamut is currently building up the energy necessary for teleporting his fellow wyrms to the locations of attack.${prompt}
  8375: If we could reach Bahamut before he has stored enough power, we may be able to persuade him not to begin his ambush of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8376: Persuade him? The end of the world is right before us, and you want to sit down and chat with the bringer of that destruction!?${prompt}
  8377: |-
    Exactly!
    With the Phoenix Blade and ${name-player} by my side, I am positive that I can convince Bahamut to spare the lives of those on this world.${prompt}
  8378: But to succeed, I require your assistance, Doctor.${prompt}
  8379: I need to know where that boy was first discovered!${prompt}
  8380: '...!${prompt}'
  8381: |-
    ...
    Understood.
    Wolfgang, captain of the Ducal Guard, ordered me not to reveal this information to anyone...however, I am afraid I no longer have any choice.${prompt}
  8382: On the first floor of Delkfutt's Tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the spire.${prompt}
  8383: It is somewhere down there that the boy mysteriously appeared. A large, central chamber...but that is all I remember.${prompt}
  8384: |-
    I am extremely grateful for all you have done for us, Doctor.
    Come, ${name-player}, we have no time to lose.${prompt}
  8385: Ah, but there is a door--a locked door, and only Wolfgang knows how to open it.${prompt}
  8386: I have no worries, as Phoenix will lead the way.${prompt}
  8387: ${name-player}, make your preparations quickly and meet me at the tower.${prompt}
  8388: ${name-player}, it may be a worthless effort, but let me ask Wolfgang for the key to that chamber.${prompt}
  8389: While sometimes misled, he is a man who strongly believes in justice. He may feel that it is solely his duty to protect the world on the eve of its destruction.${prompt}
  8390: |-
    We must let him know that there are those of us who also follow the same path as he.
    Here. Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8391: |-
    The boy first appeared in Delkfutt's Tower.
    On the first floor of the tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the structure...${prompt}
  8392: |-
    Wolfgang will know how to open the door that lies beyond.
    Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8393: I see by his reaction that Wolfgang understood the meaning of the map.${prompt}
  8394: |-
    Where should you go? Hah hah. That's a secret, ${name-player}.
    Though, if you think hard enough, I feel you will come to understand.${prompt}
  8395: |-
    I knew all along Wolfgang would come. He is a good man, despite being a little stubborn.
    Now hurry to Delkfutt's Tower. Tenzen should already be on his way.${prompt}
  8396: Somewhere on the first floor there is a large doorway that leads to the basement of the tower. The key you received from Wolfgang will open that door.${prompt}
  8397: Wolfgang should not be giving you any more problems. I think he has finally started to realize what is truly important in this world.${prompt}
  8398: |-
    Have you heard the rumors?
    Some are saying that the end of the world is upon us.${prompt}
  8399: Thanks to that, we here at the clinic have lately been spending more time mending people's spirits than their broken bones.${prompt}
  8400: ${name-player}, it is good to see you.${prompt}
  8401: We have finally grasped the entire tapestry that our separate tales have woven.${prompt}
  8402: I never believed that something like this was possible.${prompt}
  8403: I suggest you prepare yourself before Lady Ulmia arrives.${prompt}
  8404: Why is everyone so quiet? Is something wrong?${prompt}
  8405: |-
    Lady Ulmia, we have been waiting for you.
    Will you steel your heart and listen to the story we have to tell?${prompt}
  8406: Of course, we have tried to refute this conclusion and find some other explanation.${prompt}
  8407: However, we now know that the boy, Selh'teus, has come to thwart the plans of the ancient ones and steal the light of the crystals.${prompt}
  8408: We also know that the Divinity of Darkness that rules over the Kindred was not Promathia after all.${prompt}
  8409: But...the Moblins...heard from...the Divinity of Darkness...that the...Keeper of the Apocalypse...has already...arisen.${prompt}
  8410: And surely you have seen the magicite imbedded in Prishe's chest?${prompt}
  8411: According to your explanation, that stone contained the Emptiness of the Twilight God, Promathia.${prompt}
  8412: |-
    Lady Ulmia.
    This must come as a shock for one so close to Lady Prishe.${prompt}
  8413: But I must inform you of the facts I have learned from the terrestrial avatars Carbuncle and Fenrir.${prompt}
  8414: After ten thousand years, the Keeper of the Apocalypse was fated to be born in the nation of Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8415: Surely you are not saying that this keeper you speak of is Prishe!${prompt}
  8416: |-
    That is impossible!
    I refuse to believe it!${prompt}
  8417: We have been friends since the time before Tavnazia's destruction!${prompt}
  8418: I can honestly say that I have never met a person more pure of heart.${prompt}
  8419: She has more faith, and more courage...${prompt}
  8420: How could she be the Keeper of the Apocalypse and still urge Diabolos to save the world?${prompt}
  8421: It is true that I do not know of anyone who possesses the zest for life that Prishe has.${prompt}
  8422: And if we had but the time and the knowledge, we would rescue Lady Prishe from this destiny.${prompt}
  8423: However, we have no time remaining.${prompt}
  8424: |-
    A duty lies before us:
    Lord Bahamut and his minions must be stopped!${prompt}
  8425: And if Cardinal Mildaurion is still alive as we believe, she will be planning to use Prishe to awaken the Twilight God.${prompt}
  8426: With Prishe and her magicite in the cardinal's possession, the world is one step away from oblivion!${prompt}
  8427: When Promathia...awakens...there will be...no stopping...the Moblins.${prompt}
  8428: |-
    Stop it, all of you.
    You truly intend to do away with Prishe if it means the plans of Wyrmking Bahamut will be prevented?${prompt}
  8429: That is something I cannot do!${prompt}
  8430: Lady Ulmia!${prompt}
  8431: '...${prompt}'
  8432: |-
    Let her be.
    The first thing we have to do is rrrescue Prishe from the Grand Duke Palace.
    I'll start working on a plan.${prompt}
  8433: |-
    I will call upon some old acquaintances.
    They may be able to help us.${prompt}
  8434: |-
    I wish...no more lives...to be lost.
    I...will do...what I can.${prompt}
  8435: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8436: Do you agree with our decision?${prompt}
  8437: |-
    Do you agree?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, I don't.
    There's no other way.
    What decision?${prompt}
  8438: Do not let our actions concern you.${prompt}
  8439: You are free to follow your own path from here.${prompt}
  8440: |-
    I only ask that you look after Lady Ulmia.
    She did not take this news well.${prompt}
  8441: There is little you can say to comfort her, but at least see her safely to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  8442: If you ask the aid of Lady Esha'ntarl, I am sure your return will be a swift one.${prompt}
  8443: Until we meet again!${prompt}
  8444: |-
    You understand what we have all agreed to here?
    We have come to a brutal and bloody conclusion.${prompt}
  8445: Although no one life holds more importance than another, I have a duty to save the world, no matter the cost.${prompt}
  8446: |-
    But still...
    I worry for Lady Ulmia.${prompt}
  8447: In order to save the world from destruction, we must defeat the one known as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8448: Even if Lady Prishe herself is the Keeper, I will not fail to carry out this task.${prompt}
  8449: |-
    A beautiful lady justaru ran that way, tears streaming down her face.
    I've never seen anything like it.${prompt}
  8450: |-
    Today is Tarutaru day at the pub, and she was an Elvaan.
    I can understand how that'd make you want to cry.${prompt}
  8451: I am glad to see that you have all survived unscathed.${prompt}
  8452: You...!${prompt}
  8453: You are...the priest...!?${prompt}
  8454: Nice to see you both again after so long.${prompt}
  8455: |-
    It's been twenty years since I've seen you, Shikaree Z.
    And a hundred years for you, Jabbos, if I'm not mistaken.${prompt}
  8456: And you, the man of extraordinary luck.${prompt}
  8457: I am most delighted to be in your presence once more, Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  8458: I would love to celebrate this long overdue reunion; however, now is not the time.${prompt}
  8459: Lord Bahamut has revealed to us an unsettling truth--the Keeper of the Apocalypse waits in the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  8460: Until now, the Armathrwn Society had believed the city of Al'Taieu destroyed.${prompt}
  8461: Judging by the counsel of the terrestrial avatars and the memories of Selh'teus, however, we can assume that the celestial capital still exists.${prompt}
  8462: |-
    The society is now focused on gaining further information.
    To this end, the objective of our next operation is to capture--not kill--Lord Bahamut.${prompt}
  8463: I, Esha'ntarl, will join the main fleet of warships and head once more to the ends of the earth.${prompt}
  8464: But there is another important matter that requires our immediate attention--a matter involving the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  8465: Someone has apparently severed the fifth crystal from the Crystal Line.${prompt}
  8466: When the boy, Selh'teus, appeared, was not this Crystal Line the conduit he traversed with Lord Bahamut?${prompt}
  8467: |-
    Just a damn moment!
    So now we can't use this pipeline gizmo to get to the fifth mothercrystal!?${prompt}
  8468: How are we supposed to get to Al'Taieu and wipe the floor with the Keeper of the Apocalypse!?${prompt}
  8469: |-
    How, indeed.
    In any event, we must search for an alternative route now that Phoenix is no longer with us.${prompt}
  8470: |-
    Wait.
    Mildaurion, you mentioned that “someone” isolated the fifth mothercrystal?${prompt}
  8471: Who is rrresponsible for this act of sabotage?${prompt}
  8472: |-
    I do not know.

  8477: This is most worrisome. I shall follow him and see he does not come to harm.${prompt}
  8478: I will accompany you!${prompt}
  8479: I realize that Jabbos has tried for years to convince the Moblins that they are not the children of Promathia.${prompt}
  8480: But for the sake of the mothercrystal, the Moblins cannot be left to their own devices.${prompt}
  8481: If he fails to persuade them otherwise, they may attempt to destroy the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  8482: Destroy the crystal!?${prompt}
  8483: The mothercrystal is at both the beginning and the end of a person's journey in this life.${prompt}
  8484: After learning this fact from Jabbos, the Moblins now believe that destroying the mothercrystal will spell the end for the children of Altana.${prompt}
  8485: How could Jabbos fail to mention something so important!?${prompt}

    He had no choice.

    Not a momentaru ago, there were Mithra and Galka and all sorts filing out the door.
    They were saying something about going to Movalpolos.${prompt}
  8501: |-
    Are they thinking of bringing their beastmen buddies back here?
    Next thing you know, they'll be having “Goblin's Day.”${prompt}
  8502: You must indeed be serious about your beliefs to choose the Temple of the Goddess over the bustling sights and sounds of Jeuno.${prompt}

  8506: "Thank you, adventurer. \nPerhaps you have heard of the ruins of Pso'Xja, that are found on the Beaucedine Glacier?${prompt}"
  8507: It is whispered that those ruins are deeply entwined with the history of the ancients.${prompt}
  8508: When thieves discovered the mysterious structures in later years, they were quick to put up iron grates at the tower entrances and carry away the relics within.${prompt}
  8509: However, they were never able to open the decorated gate that lies in the deepest part of the ruins. The thieves searched for a way to open this portal for many years.${prompt}
  8510: |-
    Only recently did they finally stumble across the key to the gate.
    What they found inside apparently did not live up to their expectations.${prompt}
  8511: Believing that they had claimed all the treasures to be found, the Tenshodo opened almost every area of the six towers to adventurers.${prompt}
  8512: |-
    I do not agree with the Tenshodo's appraisal of their final discovery.
    The magical device that was hidden behind that gate closely resembles those that exist in the towers of Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8513: Would this not mean that the towers of Pso'Xja have a similar function to the Sarutabaruta ruins?${prompt}
  8514: I have had adventurers who share your level of integrity delve into the ruins several times to investigate this possibility.${prompt}
  8515: |-
    I do not think the Tenshodo has given the matter due consideration.
    A magical device was found on the other side of that gate.${prompt}
  8516: No one knows the purpose behind the towers' construction, and it is far too dangerous to allow the general population access to the ruins without further research.${prompt}
  8517: And that is why I decided to ask adventurers who share your level of integrity to place a seal upon that gate.${prompt}
  8518: |-
    The only problem is, not one adventurer has been able to reach it.
    There are two other gates that block the path to the deepest section of the southwest tower.${prompt}
  8519: Will you attempt to find a way into the southwest tower's heart?${prompt}
  8520: |-
    Will you go?
    ${selection-lines}
    I will.
    I don't think so.${prompt}
  8521: |-
    You will be able to open the final gate with this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    It should also activate the magical device that lies beyond.${prompt}
  8522: |-
    Once the device is activated, return here for your reward.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8523: |-
    Seal the final gate using this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8524: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and activate the device that lies beyond the final gate.
    Both the gate and the device should respond to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8525: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and seal the final gate with the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.

  8526: |-
    That was too close...
    Thankfully, the device was activated before those meddling scholars from Windurst arrived.${prompt}
  8527: |-
    But my work is not done.
    I must find a way to seal the device so that no one can stop it...${prompt}
  8528: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from activating the device.${prompt}
  8529: |-
    The devices within the other towers are also being activated, one by one.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8530: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from sealing the gate.${prompt}
  8531: |-
    Do not be concerned; the gates within the other towers are being sealed as we speak.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8532: |-
    Ah, the gate did not open for you?
    That is because a more experienced adventurer activated the device before you arrived.${prompt}
  8533: |-
    However, I still wish to recognize your sincere desire to carry out my request.
    Please accept this token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  8534: |-
    What would happen should all of the devices be activated?
    I really couldn't say.${prompt}

  8607: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8608: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8609: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8610: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8611: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8612: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8613: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8614: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8615: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}

  8621: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8622: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8623: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8624: I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.${prompt}
  8625: |-
    But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds.
    They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.${prompt}
  8626: When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:${prompt}
  8627: Then what's the difference between animals and people?${prompt}
  8628: |-
    I answered, “People are smarter than animals.”
    And then she retorted, “People sure are more sly!”${prompt}
  8629: |-
    Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me!
    I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.${prompt}
  8630: |-
    People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants.
    This difference is what makes it all worth it.${prompt}
  8631: |-
    There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe.
    But in the end, we all come from the same source.${prompt}
  8632: That's true for both people and animals.${prompt}
  8633: |-
    We all have this thing called a soul.
    The souls of animals are pure and simple.${prompt}
  8634: |-
    Look over there.
    That chocobo is living proof.${prompt}
  8635: |-
    You should ask someone how that chocobo was born.
    Then you'll have your answers.${prompt}
  8636: '...And then she went on her way.${prompt}'
  8637: I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.${prompt}
  8638: Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.${prompt}
  8639: She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.${prompt}
  8640: How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.${prompt}
  8641: I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...${prompt}
  8642: |-
    That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls.
    She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.${prompt}
  8643: She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.${prompt}
  8644: |-
    According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok.
    How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...${prompt}
  8645: |-
    What can I do for you?
    If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.${prompt}
  8646: Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.${prompt}
  8647: |-
    You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands.
    Have a safe journey.${prompt}
  8648: A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?${prompt}
  8649: Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8650: She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.${prompt}
  8651: The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.${prompt}
  8652: For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.${prompt}
  8653: I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.${prompt}
  8654: Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.${prompt}
  8655: In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...${prompt}
  8656: |-
    But then one day, Silver Comet was gone.
    Some chocobo thief had stolen her.${prompt}
  8657: |-
    Hm?
    You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables?
    You must be mistaken.${prompt}
  8658: Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.${prompt}
  8659: He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.${prompt}
  8660: That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8661: If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.${prompt}
  8662: |-
    He's given up the adventuring life, it seems.
    Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.${prompt}
  8663: The gate is locked.${prompt}
  8664: |-
    Whaddaya want?
    I got no time for adventurers.${prompt}
  8665: |-
    Huh? Where'd you hear...
    Well, whatever.${prompt}
  8666: You say you got business with me?${prompt}
  8667: |-
    Silver Comet...
    What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for?
    You some kind of crackpot?${prompt}
  8668: Leave me alone, you loon.${prompt}
  8669: "Can't you see I'm busy? \nThis place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.${prompt}"
  8670: |-
    Hold up a minute.
    If you bring me some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I might be willing to give you the time of day.${prompt}
  8671: |-
    Yep, three of those ought to do it.
    I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.${prompt}
  8672: |-
    You brought what I asked for?
    Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.${prompt}
  8673: |-
    It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see.
    Helps me get around.${prompt}
  8674: |-
    Now, then.
    You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?${prompt}
  8675: |-
    She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable.
    I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.${prompt}
  8676: |-
    I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge.
    That chocobo wasn't right in the head.${prompt}
  8677: |-
    She threw herself headlong into the marshes.
    Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
  8678: When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.${prompt}
  8679: That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.${prompt}
  8680: |-
    That general's a real schemer.
    Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.${prompt}
  8681: It's his fault I almost got killed!${prompt}
  8682: |-
    Huh?
    Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.${prompt}
  8683: Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.${prompt}
  8684: Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.${prompt}
  8685: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses.
    I'll see you around, adventurer.${prompt}
  8686: Were you able to meet with that adventurer?${prompt}
  8687: |-
    ...Is that right?
    I think you were around that ${item-singular: 1[2]} a bit too long.${prompt}
  8688: It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.${prompt}
  8689: Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.${prompt}
  8690: |-
    You mentioned a “Shooting Star”?
    I know that name.${prompt}
  8691: |-
    That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet.
    Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.${prompt}
  8692: Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.${prompt}
  8693: |-
    I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh.
    The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.${prompt}
  8694: |-
    Hm?
    Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?${prompt}
  8695: |-
    I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken.
    I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.${prompt}
  8696: He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  8697: |-
    But, wait.
    I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus.
    He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...${prompt}
  8698: Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?${prompt}
  8699: You are being attacked!${prompt}
  8700: Now is not the time for that!${prompt}
  8701: You sense something is not quite right...${prompt}
  8702: You find nothing.${prompt}
  8703: I...I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
  8704: |-
    Wow...
    So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?${prompt}
  8705: I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.${prompt}
  8706: So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8707: That collar...!?${prompt}
  8708: |-
    You've dug pretty far into this old story.
    Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.${prompt}
  8709: Please don't be angry, Brutus.${prompt}
  8710: I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.${prompt}
  8711: There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.${prompt}
  8712: I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.${prompt}
  8713: Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.${prompt}
  8714: Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.${prompt}
  8715: Really!?${prompt}
  8716: Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.${prompt}
  8717: He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.${prompt}
  8718: But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.${prompt}
  8719: We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.${prompt}
  8720: But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.${prompt}
  8721: Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.${prompt}
  8722: She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.${prompt}
  8723: It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.${prompt}
  8724: |-
    But she never gave up.
    She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.${prompt}
  8725: |-
    Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands.
    She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.${prompt}
  8726: That's when I took off her collar and set her free.${prompt}
  8727: What happened to them after that?${prompt}
  8728: Did they live happily ever after?${prompt}
  8729: |-
    That's right.
    And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.${prompt}
  8730: What a great story...${prompt}
  8731: |-
    It's not over yet.
    The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.${prompt}
  8732: "That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today. \nYou want to keep that chocobo safe, right?${prompt}"
  8733: Right!${prompt}
  8734: I'll never tell, I promise!${prompt}
  8735: |-
    Glad to hear it.
    And one more thing...${prompt}
  8736: Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.${prompt}
  8737: Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Right.
    That's because animals come from the same source as people.${prompt}
  8739: |-
    Adventurer, you can have this.
    Keep this story to yourself.${prompt}
  8740: |-
    Thank you so much!
    And this is from me.${prompt}
  8741: I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.${prompt}
  8742: I would like to meet her again some day...${prompt}
  8743: Press any button to continue.${prompt}
  8744: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt}
  8745: |-
    You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.
    Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt}
  8746: We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt}
  8747: |-
    Have you seen one?
    ${selection-lines}
    Indeed I have.
    I'm not quite sure...${prompt}
  8748: |-
    Aha, so you have firsthand experience.
    You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt}
  8749: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt}
  8750: |-
    My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.
    Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt}
  8751: |-
    I wish to know about the ENM in...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere in particular.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.
    Monarch Linn.
    The Shrouded Maw.
    Mine Shaft #2716.
    Bearclaw Pinnacle.
    Boneyard Gully.${prompt}
  8752: 'You won''t be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt}'
  8753: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt}
  8754: |-
    You have no need of my expertise at the moment?
    Very well.${prompt}
  8755: And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt}
  8756: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt}
  8757: |-
    These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.
    They must be destroyed.${prompt}
  8758: I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...${prompt}
  8759: Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.${prompt}
  8760: I hope I have been of some assistance to you.${prompt}
  8761: |-
    This dark plague grows ever stronger...
    If it is not stopped soon...${prompt}
  8762: |-
    Which item will you use to enter?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8763: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Esha'ntarl's ship has returned.${prompt}
  8764: |-
    This is excellent timing.
    I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  8765: |-
    My duty here is done.
    I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.${prompt}
  8766: |-
    I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions.
    You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.${prompt}
  8767: |-
    I have awaited your return, ${name-player}.
    You must tell me all that has happened.${prompt}
  8768: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.${prompt}
  8769: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.${prompt}
  8770: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.${prompt}
  8771: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?${prompt}
  8772: |-
    Has the keeper been defeated?
    ${selection-lines}
    Completely.
    Who can say?${prompt}
  8773: |-
    I knew it!
    Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...${prompt}
  8774: |-
    Tell me.
    What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?${prompt}
  8775: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...${prompt}
  8776: They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...${prompt}
  8777: |-
    The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago.
    Returned to Promathia...${prompt}
  8778: |-
    “Opening the Gates of Paradise” is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal.
    A way to return the world to its original state.${prompt}
  8779: |-
    The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood.
    The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.${prompt}
  8780: Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.${prompt}
  8781: She said, “As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.”${prompt}
  8782: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  8783: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  8784: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  8785: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  8786: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  8787: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  8788: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  8789: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  8790: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  8791: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  8792: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  8793: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  8794: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  8795: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8796: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  8797: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  8798: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8799: There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8800: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.${prompt}
  8801: But do not misunderstand.${prompt}
  8802: This possibility did not always exist.${prompt}
  8803: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.${prompt}
  8804: |-
    I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures.
    Feel free to choose one.${prompt}
  8805: Until our paths cross once more, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8806: Thank you, and farewell.${prompt}
  8807: |-
    There're so many people in this town.
    It takes me by surprrrise no matter how many times I come here.${prompt}
  8808: |-
    All this activity makes it difficult to get anything done.
    It's enough to make my whiskers curl.${prompt}
  8809: |-
    I don't think you'd be able to help me out, though.
    Why don't you rrrun along?${prompt}
  8810: |-
    Hey, you there.
    You wouldn't happen to have a little time up your sleeve, would you?${prompt}
  8811: I'm looking for some assistance, you see.${prompt}
  8812: |-
    I have to find out if these people are carrying a certain type of mirror.
    Look at the size of this list! Have you ever seen so many names!?${prompt}
  8813: |-
    I could rrreally use some help.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  8814: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    Not right now.${prompt}
  8815: Rrreally!? What a generous soul you are!${prompt}
  8816: There's a rrreward involved, so don't be too hasty with your rrreply!${prompt}
  8817: |-
    That's a shame...
    There's a rrreward involved, so let me know if you change your mind, or if your schedule frrrees up, okay?${prompt}
  8818: |-
    Take a look at this list.
    I want you to choose one person and see what information you can dig up on them.
    Do you think you can handle that?${prompt}
  8819: |-
    Rrridiculously long, isn't it?
    And this list is only for Jeuno.
    Makes my tail droop just thinking about it.${prompt}
  8820: First choose a page, then pick a name.${prompt}

    Yes. One of the mirrors was being kept in the Empire of Aht Urhgan, but was eventually lost to the world.
    Or so the tale goes...${prompt}
  9817: It was once stored within a small chest and strrrictly guarded, with only selected people permitted to view the mirror itself.${prompt}
  9818: This looking glass supposedly emitted a light of such heart-stopping beauty, it was almost blinding.${prompt}
  9819: This light was so dazzling, it spilled from the chest and soothed the souls of all who gazed upon it.${prompt}
  9820: And so we can deduce from these properties that the mirror lost to the Aht Urhgan Empire was most likely the Glass of Blessed Radiance.${prompt}
  9821: If this mirror still exists somewhere in the world, I would do anything to track it down!${prompt}
  9822: I'm a sucker for beautiful artifacts. And this tale of divine rrradiance makes me want it even more!${prompt}
  9823: '...This book appears to be of considerable age. You did well to discover such a valuable resource.${prompt}'
  9824: Let's see what it has to say.${prompt}
  9825: “Worshipped in the Near East, there is a small mirror whose creation was ordered by a king, now long deceased.”${prompt}
  9826: “As time passed, the looking glass came to be revered as a holy object, and even while it was kept under guard...”${prompt}
  9827: “...people began to call it the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.”${prompt}
  9828: “The blackened metal of the mirror emits a dim, dark light that conjures images of early evening.”${prompt}
  9829: Hmmm...${prompt}
  9830: |-
    That would suggest to me that the brrroken glass I have now is this Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
    The description fits perfectly.${prompt}
  9831: The explanation continues...${prompt}
  9832: “This metal is like no other substance we have ever encountered.”${prompt}
  9833: “Expert scientists concur that while this substance gives off a metallic glint...”${prompt}
  9834: “...it has a malleable structure at room temperature almost like a liquid. However, for reasons unknown, it is able to maintain its shape.”${prompt}
  9835: “The metal used by the creators of the mirror no longer exists, and as such, it would be impossible to duplicate its creation today.”${prompt}
  9836: |-
    No longer exists...!
    Then how am I supposed to...?${prompt}

  9848: Is there more to the passage?${prompt}
  9849: It continues...${prompt}
  9850: “However, the method for crafting the mirror has been discovered and follows these steps:”${prompt}
  9851: “One. Prepare the metal that is to become the body of the mirror.”${prompt}
  9852: “Two. Find a spring with a surface as smooth as glass. The spring must be filled with clear water.”${prompt}
  9853: |-
    “Three. Chant the charm, and offer a prayer.
    The charm is only known by the guardians of the mirror...”${prompt}
  9854: “If the above steps are followed correctly, an enchanted mirror will be created.”${prompt}
  9855: |-

  10882: There is a reason why I am here. Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  10883: An interesting idea was proposed at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly...${prompt}
  10884: '...And so it seems that the adventurers are using their own unique set of rules for Ballista.${prompt}'
  10885: There is also the remarkable news that the most capable adventurers in the world came together for a tournament that encompassed the greater part of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10886: Ballista has been taken out of our hands and placed into those of the adventurers.${prompt}
  10887: I agree. The Ballista participants have forced us to recall the true meaning of the word “hero.”${prompt}
  10888: The revival of Ballista has raised morale and restored public order. I suppose we have achieved our original goals.${prompt}
  10889: '...We have, have we?${prompt}'

  10894: |-
    Stop quarreling! It is my fault for mumbling to myself.
    Please listen to what I have to say.${prompt}
  10895: I agree that the San d'Orian Royal Knights are endowed with sound, quick decision-making abilities and deserve admiration.${prompt}
  10896: The deeds of a single hero are capable of setting afire the hearts of many a soldier. We must not neglect the power of motivation in leading an army to victory.${prompt}
  10897: Even so, soldiers must be able to follow their commander's orders and fulfill their given roles. Arbitrary decisions can lead an entire army to its doom.${prompt}
  10898: Thus, I am of the opinion that observing Ballista matches in their current state may not be a beneficial practice for our armies.${prompt}
  10899: |-
    Your remarks are inexcusable!
    How dare you denounce a San d'Orian tradition! I suggest you reconsider your statements.${prompt}
  10900: |-
    I apologize.
    I must admit that Ballista has noticeably improved the skills of many an adventurer and educated our soldiers on the importance of courage.${prompt}
  10901: However, the reality is that our armies are divided into several units, each with its own role. The soldiers must be able to coordinate themselves effectively and behave as a whole. I believe that a new form of Conflict that trains participants to work in a group would be most rewarding.${prompt}
  10902: |-
    Harumph, do we look like children to you?
    You could have cut that explanation in half and it would have been more than sufficientaru!${prompt}
  10903: All right then. I'll get straight to the point now.${prompt}
  10904: |-
    Oh, give us a break!
    What point could you make?
    All your vague statements and whatnot!
    Why not lend an ear to what I've got?${prompt}
  10905: |-
    No thanks...
    Well then, I shall be frank.${prompt}
  10906: I propose the reinstatement of “Brenner” as a new form of Conflict!${prompt}
  10907: Brenner!?${prompt}
  10908: |-
    Je me souviens de ce nom. Avant la Grande Guerre, Brenner était utilisé dans la sélection des Mousquetaires d'Or.
    Cependant, la compétition était extraordinairement féroce, et on dit que les pertes dépassaient toujours le nombre de candidats retenus.${prompt}
  10909: Ces histoires étaient fabriquées simplement pour exagérer le danger de Brenner.${prompt}
  10910: |-
    Brenner a été initialement créé comme exercice d'entraînement pour les mineurs.
    Le résultat de chaque match dépendait des compétences des participants en matière de gestion des rôles et encourageait la compétition en équipe.${prompt}
  10911: Bien sûr, je ne suggère pas que nous abolissions le Ballista. Je conseille simplement d'ajouter Brenner à la liste des options d'entraînement afin de fournir les éléments de travail d'équipe que je trouve absents dans les matchs actuels.${prompt}
  10912: |-

  10916: |-
    Je soutiendrai votre plan, mais veuillez être conscient
    que contre les mages noirs, personne n'a de prière !${prompt}
  10917: |-
    Si cela vient en complément du Ballista, je crois même qu'Excenmille n'aurait aucun argument.
    Vous avez mon approbation.${prompt}
  10918: |-
    J'apprécie votre décision.
    Maintenant, j'aimerais aussi suggérer que nous nous débarrassions de l'exigence de licence et des restrictions de nationalité pour Brenner.${prompt}
  10919: |-
    Une déclaration assez audacieuse.
    Cependant, les équipes seraient composées d'inconnus complets si nous appliquions ce que vous proposez. Est-ce votre désir ?${prompt}
  10920: The adventurers have taught me much, but one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the strength of the bond between linkshell members.${prompt}
  10921: Linkshells provide an exemplary model of unity. The cooperation and friendly competition of these groups are like those of the closest companions or even family. And thus, I propose that we introduce matches divided by linkshell rather than nation.${prompt}
  10922: |-
    Interesting. You seem to have worked out these plans more thoroughly than I expected.
    Have you also given consideration to where the matches will be held?${prompt}
  10923: |-

    Wolfgang, shall we invite our guest in now?${prompt}
  10924: A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am called Afdeen.${prompt}
  10925: I have come to your lands by order of the great Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  10926: |-
    By Altana!
    Do you mean to suggest that you are a direct disciple of Sir Abdhaljs? I believe I have heard your name before.${prompt}
  10927: |-
    Is your master in good health?
    He deserves our gratitude for the Diorama...${prompt}
  10928: Yes, he is quite well. However, he desires no reward. He is quite pleased with the Ballista matches that take place each day in the Diorama.${prompt}
  10929: On another note, he has expressed interest in a new form of Conflict. He has entrusted me with matters regarding his new diorama, which is designed after Purgonorgo Isle.${prompt}
  10930: The great Abdhaljs has created a new diorama specifically for this new form of Conflict? Magnificent! You will hear no argument from me.${prompt}
  10931: That's dandy-wandy, but don't forget that Windurst won't lend a single gil to the project!${prompt}
  10932: |-
    Well, there you have it. The preparations sound fine!
    Okay then, inform me when Windurst is next in line!${prompt}
  10933: The reinstatement of Brenner has now been approved!${prompt}
  10934: I will send a detailed explanation of the rules to each of you. If you should have any objections, please take them up with Sir Wolfgang.${prompt}
  10935: Obviously, the citizens of Windurst have the closestaru bond. Our adventurers will have to teach the rest of you a thing or two about teamwork now.${prompt}
  10936: |-
    I am simply beside myself--my prayers will not cease!
    Wishing your people get through this in one piece!
    Ohohoho～!${prompt}
  10937: |-
    I will not stand for these meaningless insults against the Royal Knights!
    Our records in Ballista prove our prowess in working as a team.${prompt}
  10938: I think it is time to call this meeting to a close. Thank you all for your participation.${prompt}
  10939: How can any idea be interesting when Bastok thoughtaru of it first?${prompt}
  10940: |-
    You're missing the point--this'll make them prepared
    for the time that they're needed, my plans unimpaired!${prompt}

  10942: |-
    Now to just wait and see
    what Brenner will bring to me!${prompt}

  11416: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  11417: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  11418: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  11419: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11420: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  11421: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11422: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  11423: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  11424: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  11425: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  11432: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  11433: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  11434: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  11435: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  11436: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  11437: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11438: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  11439: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  11440: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  11441: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  11442: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11443: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  11444: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11445: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  11446: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  11447: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11448: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  11449: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  11450: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11451: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11452: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  11453: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  11454: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  11455: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11456: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11457: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  11458: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  11459: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

  11480: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}

  11493: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11494: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  11495: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'

    Abilities.

    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11506: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  11507: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  11508: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  11509: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  11510: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  11511: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  11512: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  11513: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  11514: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  11515: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  11516: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  11517: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11518: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  11519: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  11520: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  11521: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11522: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  11523: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11524: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11525: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  11526: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11527: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  11532: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt}
  11533: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  11534: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  11535: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'
  11536: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt}
  11537: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt}
  11538: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt}

  11722: With this plan, the chocobos can enjoy a vigorous exercise program together. This increases the chance that a chick with high endurance will be born. Competition also raises the possibility that the male chocobo's traits will be inherited. Would you like to choose this plan?${prompt}

  11724: With this plan, the chocobos will get a tour of the Jeunoan streets led by yours truly. Seeing new sights will improve the chances of a highly receptive chick being born.

    <Sigh>...
    Well, ye were up t'the task, and no mistakin'.
    Welcome to Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11829: 'Ye know, I have another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, but its light faded years ago...${prompt}'

  11833: Ye look awfully familiar fer some reason...${prompt}
  11834: Nah, it couldn't be...${prompt}
  11835: Now, before ye begin yer trainin', let me tell ye a little somethin' about the origin o' our dance.${prompt}
  11836: It's a martial style based on the traditional Bastokan “Kriegstanz”--a dance used in actual battle.${prompt}
  11837: O' course, we've learned how t'adapt this martial style into a form suitable fer performances.${prompt}
  11838: But first, ye'll have t'work on the basic, martial movements.${prompt}
  11839: |-
    Rhea!
    Show this rookie the ropes!${prompt}
  11840: And now yer body has been conditioned fer the fundamental movements o' the Kriegstanz.${prompt}
  11841: |-
    Don't just stand there scuffin' yer feet!
    I expect ye t'spend ev'ry spare moment practicin' those moves!
    Troupe Brilioth only accepts the best!${prompt}
  11842: You can now become a dancer!${prompt}
  11843: |-
    Dance is learned by doin', not by watchin'.
    Get yer body movin', and dance until ye drop!${prompt}
  11844: |-
    What are you gawpin' at?
    I don't give out autographs.${prompt}
  11845: 'I''m glad you''ve joined our little grrroup, but be warned: the hard work has only just begun!${prompt}'
  11846: |-
    They're so pretty!
    I wanna be a dancer too someday!${prompt}
  11847: Deux demoiselles du champ de bataille... et un Galka ?${prompt}
  11848: Il y a beaucoup de “danseurs”, mais seulement quelques-uns sont vraiment brillants.${prompt}
  11849: |-
    Et parmi ces quelques brillants, dit-on que la plus talentueuse et gracieuse est visitée par la Divinité de la Danse.
    Est-ce vrai ?${prompt}
  11850: J'ai beaucoup appris sur la Guerre des Cristaux en m'occupant d'Ilumida.${prompt}
  11851: Elle m'a même parlé de ces affreuses statues que les gens appellent “gouffres”.${prompt}
  11852: Je n'ai pas moi-même vécu cette expérience, mais ils disent que rien que la vue de ces idoles fait ressurgir les souvenirs les plus horribles de la guerre...${prompt}
  11853: |-
    Je me demande s'il existe d'autres choses dans le monde qui retourlent aux gens cette période horrible.
    Si seulement de telles atrocités pouvaient être enterrées pour toujours.${prompt}
  11854: Est-ce que les bêtes ont aussi un dieu auquel elles prient, de la même manière que nous demandons les bénédictions d'Altana ?${prompt}
  11855: |-
    Bien que je ne sois pas sûr que je voudrais connaître les prières tordues que les bêtes pourraient faire.
    Et toi ?${prompt}
  11856: Why, isn't it ${name-player}? Been workin' hard on yer steps, have ye?${prompt}
  11857: Why don't ye show me some o' yer moves? Go on, let me see.${prompt}
  11858: Hmmm...sharp, conf'dent steps, an' great upper body balance t'boot. Without a doubt, ye've improved.${prompt}
  11859: Looks like ye've been faithfully rehearsin' the basics o' our martial style, the “Kriegstanz.”${prompt}
  11860: But yer dance still lacks a certain...“shine.”${prompt}
  11861: Listen up. What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates an' enchants.${prompt}
  11862: I want ye to think about how ye can make yer dance “shine.”${prompt}
  11863: What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates and enchants.${prompt}
  11864: What? You want to know what's lacking in your dance?${prompt}
  11865: That's a tough one... I personally believe you've imprrroved in leaps and bounds.${prompt}
  11866: Laila once told me about her childhood. Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg, was where her mother taught her to dance. She said that it was there she learned the true essence of dance.${prompt}
  11867: During the Great War, Witchfire Glen was rumored to be a mystical place, where pixies could be seen frolicking.${prompt}
  11868: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them there. I would love to have been part of those lessons!${prompt}
  11869: I'm sorry I couldn't help you spice up your steps...${prompt}
  11870: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them at Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg.${prompt}
  11871: So, ${name-player}. Did ye work out how to make yer dance “shine”?${prompt}
  11872: Ye think ye got the goods now? Go on then, give us a gander.${prompt}

    “A masterful dance can be the most lethal of weapons; a skillful fight, the most elegant of dances.”
    These be the words of me dear mother.${prompt}
  11875: But there's a key difference b'tween dancin' on stage, an' dancin' in battle.${prompt}
  11876: On stage, ye're dancin' in front o' an audience, with the goal o' bringin' smiles to their faces.${prompt}
  11877: Yer desire to entertain an' please the audience is what makes yer dance “shine.” Don't ye be forgettin' that.${prompt}
  11878: Laila! I've just met with Wyatt, the guy who runs a business prrromoting performance troupes...${prompt}
  11879: He said that Troupe Valeriano is next scheduled to perform rrright here, in Jeuno.${prompt}
  11880: Troupe Valeriano...in Jeuno!?${prompt}
  11881: Apparently, the leader of the trrroupe wants to come speak with you when they arrive.${prompt}
  11882: What business would the likes o' Troupe Valeriano possibly have with me?${prompt}

  11887: Just a minute ago she was singing prrraises of you, ${name-player}, and even asked me to prepare something to give to you.${prompt}
  11888: I didn't think the news would tick her off like that... No news is good news, huh?${prompt}
  11889: Enough with the daydreamin'! ${name-player}, I wanna see more “shine” on that dance o' yers!${prompt}

  11895: Have ye ever danced to a musician's tune?${prompt}
  11896: On stage, a dancer must be one with the musicians who perform the accompaniment.${prompt}
  11897: Even when ye practice, ye've to visualize the music in yer mind, or ye'll become a self-centered dancer.${prompt}
  11898: An' I guarantee ye, self-centered dancers don't get very far.${prompt}
  11899: To become a top-notch dancer, ye have t'work with a top-notch musician. I recommend ye find yerself a good musician who'll play a tune fer ye t'dance to.${prompt}
  11900: Let me tell ye a story. When I was little, I once skipped practice an' stole off to a lake in Jugner Forest. It was there that me ears were treated to a most marvelous pipe tune. Its soul-stirrin' melody is still vivid in me mind t'this day.${prompt}
  11901: Even though I never actually saw the person playin', it was this chance encounter that made me the dancer I am today.${prompt}

  11905: I wish I could meet a splendid musician who could strrrum on my heartstrings.${prompt}
  11906: Ye say ye met a bard who played a tune fer ye t'dance to?${prompt}

  11926: |-
    <Sigh>
    I suppose there's no use hidin' it...${prompt}

  11928: And such a fine dance troupe under your wings! Now I am certain it was the right decision to turn you down ten years ago.${prompt}

  11932: Except fer one thing... He has never, ever, seen me dance. How can he look forward t'seein' me “again” when he has never seen me...even once?${prompt}
  11933: How horrible!${prompt}
  11934: Ten years ago, me mother staged a big dance production, an' I was selected fer the lead role.${prompt}
  11935: It was the proudest moment in me life. It was all the more special because Mother was a strict teacher who didn't give special favors t'anyone, not even her own daughter.${prompt}
  11936: Not long after me debut as lead, Troupe Valeriano came t'town.${prompt}
  11937: Even back then, Troupe Valeriano had already grown into a circus o' a grand scale, with musicians as well as dancers in its repertory.${prompt}
  11938: Their performances were a hit with both young and old.${prompt}
  11939: It was the first circus I'd ever seen in me life, an' I was hopelessly spellbound.${prompt}
  11940: By the time they were packin' up t'move on, I was determined to join them. I wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano so badly, I took no heed o' objections from those around me.${prompt}
  11941: Waaait!${prompt}
  11942: And you are...?${prompt}
  11943: Me name's Laila Brilioth, an' I'm the number one dancer in town!${prompt}

  11947: So I've decided t'join ye.${prompt}

  11960: All the dancers left, too.${prompt}
  11961: It was a big setback, an' I sincerely sympathize with them fer their misfortune. But, I've never forgotten the humiliation I felt when I was rejected.${prompt}
  11962: After the incident, I left home an' formed Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11963: I was determined to surpass Troupe Valeriano, and did all I could t'get where I am today.${prompt}
  11964: I'm proud o' what I've achieved. But above that, I'm proud o' all o' ye.${prompt}

  11968: ${name-player}, just the adventurer I was lookin' fer.${prompt}

  11975: An' I was thinkin' t'mahself, how magnificen' it would be if troupes Brilioth an' Valeriano could collaborate in a circus an' dance extravaganza!${prompt}
  11976: These be the deetails o' mah proposal... So whad'ya think?${prompt}
  11977: Sounds interestin'... But what does Troupe Valeriano have t'say about it?${prompt}
  11978: Well ma'am, that's jes' the prawblem... Troupe Valeriano's bayn busy tourin' the three nations, so I haven't had a chance t'speak with'em prawperly yet.${prompt}
  11979: Why don't ye leave that to us? We'll go an' inform Valeriano fer ye.${prompt}
  11980: Well ain't that sweet! I'd be most grateful if you could pass the proposal to them. Guess I'll be seein' y'all later then.${prompt}
  11981: ${name-player}, I want ye to take this proposal to the music shop in Bastok Markets, an' pass it to the owner o' the establishment.${prompt}
  11982: Valeriano often goes there, so I'm told. ${prompt}
  11983: 'Pass ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the owner o'' the music shop in Bastok Markets. Valeriano is supposed t''be a regular patron.${prompt}'
  11984: Why did Laila agrrree to a collaboration? I thought she didn't like Troupe Valeriano... ${prompt}
  11985: Oh dear... Just thinking about performing alongside Troupe Valeriano gives me butterflies.${prompt}
  11986: What? Ye met Valeriano himself at the music shop?${prompt}
  11987: So...what did he think about the proposal?${prompt}
  11988: Really? He was that enthusiastic? Well, isn't that sweet...${prompt}
  11989: Hahahahahaaa!${prompt}
  11990: I've been waitin' fer this day fer so long...the day I surpass Valeriano.${prompt}

  11992: Needless t'say, ye'll dance with us too, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11993: This is the perfect opportunity...${prompt}
  11994: We'll show Troupe Valeriano who the audience prefers.${prompt}

  11996: If ye ask Rhea Myuliah, she'll give ye tips an' tricks on how t'please the crowd when ye dance.${prompt}
  11997: We're dancin' fer real this time, so no slackin' off before the performance!${prompt}
  11998: No slackin' off before the performance!${prompt}
  11999: A collaboration's one thing, but a showdown? What could Laila possibly be thinking?${prompt}
  12000: For the upcoming performance, we will dance with Troupe Valeriano perforrrming beside us.${prompt}
  12001: "The whole purpose of the collaborrration is to allow the audience to enjoy both circus and dance performances simultaneously... \nBut Laila is hell-bent on outdoing Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}"
  12002: So we must perform a style of dance that will please and drrraw the audience's attention.${prompt}
  12003: Just to give you a general idea...${prompt}
  12004: Younger folk tend to prrrefer waltz, the elderly are more fond of samba, while little kiddies can't get enough of jigs.${prompt}
  12005: While you're dancing, observe what type of crrrowd is watching Troupe Valeriano's circus performance, then dance a style that is to their taste.${prompt}
  12006: If you do so, the crowd will be surrre to turn their attention to Troupe Brilioth's performance instead.${prompt}
  12007: But you also mustn't neglect those who are alrrready watching us.${prompt}
  12008: If a style of dance isn't to their taste, it's only a matterrr of time before the audience turns their attention elsewhere.${prompt}
  12009: Does that make sense? Would you like to prrractice?${prompt}

    Practice pleasing the audience?

  12016: Please excuse our lateness. I hope you were not waiting too long.${prompt}

  12042: Aye... A long time ago, when I was but a child...${prompt}
  12043: |-
    I was born daughter to a renowned family o' dancers, an' grew up in the midst o' the Crystal War...
    Dance was me life, an' all I knew. But one day I became fed up with day after day o' endless drills, an' decided to run away from home.${prompt}
  12044: That was when I first heard the pipe, down by Lake Mechieume. Its soul-stirrin' melody flowed through me, guidin' each step, each whirl an' pirouette...${prompt}
  12045: It revived me dwindlin' passion fer dance an' inspired me t'continue. Everythin' I have, I owe to that pipe.${prompt}
  12046: I haven't forgotten that day, Laila...the day I first saw you dance.${prompt}
  12047: You were watchin'...?${prompt}
  12048: It was the most uplifting sight I have ever had the privilege of laying my eyes upon.${prompt}
  12049: When ${name-player} delivered the proposal to me in Bastok, I thanked the Goddess for giving me the opportunity to watch you dance once more.${prompt}
  12050: '......${prompt}'
  12051: B-but I can't do it... I don't have it in me anymore. Since the day ye rejected me, me sole purpose in life has been t'surpass ye.${prompt}

  12053: I am to blame for having caused you so much pain. Please forgive me, Laila.${prompt}
  12054: But...I still firmly believe I made the right decision. It would have been wrong to accept the most promising young dancer Vana'diel has ever seen into our troupe.${prompt}
  12055: What...?${prompt}
  12056: You were brought up surrounded by loved ones, and destined to become successor to the famed Brilioth style.${prompt}
  12057: Though tender of age, your talent had already bloomed beyond compare. Never before had such a young dancer been selected lead in your mother's production--even I knew this...${prompt}
  12058: But I had no right to pluck you away from where you belonged.${prompt}
  12059: You deserved so much more than I could have ever offered in my troupe.${prompt}
  12060: No circus tent could ever be large enough for you to grow and fulfill your potential, Laila...${prompt}
  12061: So...ye rejected me not because ye didn't think I was good enough?${prompt}
  12062: The answer is clear, Laila. You are everything a dancer could ever wish to be.${prompt}
  12063: I regret not having explained my decision more clearly when I turned you down.${prompt}
  12064: Even if ye did, I don't think I would've understood...${prompt}
  12065: I so wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano, I lost sight o' all those who cared about me most...${prompt}
  12066: I was--am--just a stupid girl...${prompt}
  12067: You need not be ashamed.${prompt}
  12068: Just look at the wonderful dance troupe that you have created! Cast your eyes upon the scores of fans who love you!${prompt}
  12069: V-Valeriano...${prompt}
  12070: Laila... Will you do me the great honor of dancing for me? Just like that time so many years ago?${prompt}
  12071: Aye!${prompt}
  12072: I have never enjoyed performing as I did today. I very much look forward to our next collaboration.${prompt}

  12079: I trust it will not take another twenty years before I next see you dance. All the best, Laila.${prompt}
  12080: Were my eyes just playing trrricks on me? Could it actually be...true?${prompt}
  12081: What am I talking about?${prompt}
  12082: You see, there is a legend that says that the most talented and grrraceful of dancers are visited by the Divinity of Dance.${prompt}
  12083: But I never actually believed it until this day... Just now when Laila was dancing, I could have sworn...${prompt}
  12084: But beforrre I forget, Laila was wanting to give something to you, ${name-player}. Why don't you go and speak with her?${prompt}
  12085: That was a helluva debut performance, ${name-player}. Ye never cease t'impress me.${prompt}
  12086: Nothin' rings truer than “practice makes perfect.” Here, this is fer all yer hard work.${prompt}
  12087: I've been such a fool all these years, usin' dance just t'try to patch up me broken ego.${prompt}
  12088: It's kinda embarrassin' to admit, but I haven't enjoyed dancin' like that fer ages.${prompt}
  12089: How I'd love t'dance beside Valeriano again...${prompt}
  12090: Here, take this. Ye deserve it fer all yer hard work.${prompt}
  12091: Dance can be illusive at times--the harder ye seek, the more ye lose sight o' it...${prompt}
  12092: When that happens, just clear all unnecessary thoughts from ye mind an' ev'rythin' will be alright.${prompt}
  12093: I will strrrive to become a great dancer like Laila.${prompt}

  12097: Avec à peine plus qu'un gracieux mouvement de leurs bras, mes blessures ont été guéries et mes douleurs apaisées. On aurait dit que la Déesse elle-même était descendue de son royaume céleste...${prompt}

    Hey, don't misunderstand me there.

    Hey, do you think that maybe I could even beat ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12275: Ohohoho! Flattery truly is your forte, Luto.${prompt}
  12276: That's because I've never once strayed from my strict training routine. I know for a fact, though, that ${name-player} has been less than diligent recently. There's no use denying it, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Um...I didn't mean to suggest anything of the sort.
    But I must admit, I'm warrrming up to the idea.${prompt}

    I for one would dearly love the opportunity to do battle with you.

  12307: So what will it be? Just so you know, I won't take no for an answer.${prompt}
  12308: Just in case you misunderstood me, that was a statement, not a question.${prompt}
  12309: Come on, say yes! It'll be great, I guarantee!${prompt}
  12310: What do you say, ${name-player}? You don't mind, right?${prompt}
  12311: |-
    Come on, you have to say yes!
    If you don't, I'll tell everyone I beat you anyway!${prompt}

    I for one would dearly love the opportunity to do battle with you.

    Don't take it so seriously, ${name-player}.

    So it's settled!
    As for the venue, what better place for good friends to trrrade blows than the Qu'Bia Arena?${prompt}
  12317: |-
    The Qu'Bia Arena is fine with me.
    I'll be waiting there, so come whenever you're ready, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Woohoo! Qu'Bia Arena, here I come!
    Don't keep me waiting, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12319: |-
    I'm cool with the Qu'Bia Arena.
    See you there in a little while then, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12320: |-
    I was about to suggest the very same venue.
    Prepare yourself as you see fit, ${name-player}, then come to the Qu'Bia Arena. I shall be waiting there.${prompt}
  12321: |-
    Yay! I've always wanted to fight there!
    I'll go on ahead to the Qu'Bia Arena, so come whenever you're ready, okay?${prompt}
  12322: |-
    Alright! The Qu'Bia Arena!
    Get yourself prepared, ${name-player}. I'll meet you there in a bit.${prompt}

    Woohoo! Qu'Bia Arena, here we come!
    I'll be waiting there, ${name-player}!${prompt}

    Then all the details are settled.

    I was about to suggest the very same venue.
    Prepare yourself as you see fit, ${name-player}, then come to the Qu'Bia Arena. I shall be waiting there.${prompt}
  12328: |-
    A fitting venue to spur us into the mood.
    For a civilian, you certainly know your battlefields, Luto. Prepare yourself well, ${name-player}! I will be waiting.${prompt}
  12329: This should be interesting.${prompt}
  12330: This is gonna be great!${prompt}
  12331: I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  12332: I'm very much looking forward to our encounter.${prompt}
  12333: I can't wait!${prompt}
  12334: I haven't felt my blood pumping this hard for ages!${prompt}
  12335: Don't keep me waiting, you hear?${prompt}
  12336: This is so exciting!${prompt}
  12337: See you soon, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12338: This is so exciting! Wheeeeee!${prompt}
  12339: I'm very much looking forward to our encounter.${prompt}
  12340: And don't you dare even thinking about running away!${prompt}
  12341: Ah, I've seen you before. You're a mercenary from Salaheem's Sentinels, are you not? It is so refreshing to see one of our own out in these parts, spreading the company's good name.${prompt}
  12342: |-
    By the way, might you have already heard the news? You haven't?
    In that case, it'd be my pleasure to inform you!${prompt}

    Now, whatever could the trouble be?
    Let's take a look-see.${prompt}
  12351: |-
    A letter?
    How curious, kupo...${prompt}
  12352: Let's see what this mysterious missive has to say...${prompt}

    What's that?
    Oh, Dom Kupeliaure is the MHMU representative in charge of administering all Mog House-related affairs.
    A most charming and charitable chap, kupo!${prompt}
  12356: |-
    That's odd, though...
    He always struck me as a bit more...literate?${prompt}
  12357: |-
    Then again, he is a busy moogle.
    Contracts to sign, inspections to oversee, deadbeat adventurers to evict...
    You know how it is, kupo. Perhaps he was just in a hurry?${prompt}
  12358: Anyway, let's take a swift survey of the area, shall we?${prompt}
  12359: "Walls...worrisomely worn. \nCeiling...categorically crumbling.\nFloor stones...frighteningly falling apart.${prompt}"
  12360: |-
    I'm afraid it's just as I feared, kupo.
    This place needs some serious sprucing up!${prompt}
  12361: |-
    First, let's take care of this gaping gash in the ceiling.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} should do the trick, don't you think?${prompt}
  12362: |-
    An adventurer with your mining mastery should be able to find it in a flash, kupo!
    You wouldn't object to obtaining it for me, would you?${prompt}
  12363: |-
    While you're out, I'll take up my tools and get cracking.
    Happy hunting!${prompt}
  12364: Yes, Master?${prompt}
  12365: |-
    I'm all tied up making repairs at the moment.
    Do forgive me, kupo!${prompt}

    Incredible! What speed! What alacrity!

    Now all it'll take is a tippity-tap here, a nudgety-nudge there, and...${prompt}
  12370: |-
    There! And sublimely done, if I do say so myself.
    But no rest for the weary moogle, kupo!

  12371: You should be able to log it somewhere, I think.${prompt}
  12372: |-
    Phew! That'll do it.
    Truly, I'm shocked--stupefied, even--that our union-run Mog Houses are in a state of such disrepair!
    Something must be done...and soon, kupo!${prompt}
  12373: I know! I'll talk to Dom Kupeliaure!${prompt}
  12374: |-
    Knowing him, he'll fix these right up into lavish three-bedroom suites fit for King Kupofried himself!
    That's just the magnanimous moogle he is, kupo.${prompt}
  12375: |-
    Just leave it to me! I'll draft up an official renovation request.
    Why, we'll be living in the lap of luxury before you know it, kupo!${prompt}
  12376: As for the pressing repairs at hand...${prompt}
  12377: |-
    Yes, yes...
    Why, it looks as if we're just about--${prompt}
  12378: |-
    Er--wait one minute. Yes, I...ah...almost forgot.
    One last piece of material to put on the critical coup-de-grace!
    A...${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, kupo.${prompt}
  12379: |-
    Don't worry. Preoccupied predators are leaving their hard-earned catches all over the place these days.
    Succulent slabs of meat are literally lying around waiting to be harvested by a keen-eyed adventurer like yourself!${prompt}
  12380: |-
    What's that, Master?
    Why, of course it's required for the repairs!
    Whatever are you insinuating, kupo!?${prompt}
  12381: |-
    I wouldn't dream of roasting it medium-rare, glazed with a delectable dragon-fruit-and-rolanberry sauce, and serving it on a romantic candlelit dinner date with my darling Kupiruru!
    That's the furthest thing from my innocent moogle mind!
    Please, Master! You're the only one who can save my romantic prospects--I mean, this dilapidated dwelling, kupo!${prompt}
  12382: |-
    ...and that should do it! Feast your eyes on this craftsmanship, Master!
    The precision! The perfection! Not a single bent nail! Not a single warped plank!${prompt}
  12383: |-
    And I couldn't have done it without you, Master.
    Thank you from the bottom of my ever-humble moogle heart, kupo!${prompt}

    Could the stress of dealing with disgruntled boarders be getting to him in his advanced age, kupo?${prompt}

    It seems we have a sticky situation on our hands...
    Whatever shall we do?${prompt}

  12631: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  12632: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  12633: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  12634: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  12635: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12636: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12637: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  12638: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  12639: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12640: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12641: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12642: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12643: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12644: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12645: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12646: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12647: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12648: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12649: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12650: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12651: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12652: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12653: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12654: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12655: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12656: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12657: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12658: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12659: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12660: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12661: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12662: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12663: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12664: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12665: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12666: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12667: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12668: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12669: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12670: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12672: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12673: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12674: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12675: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12676: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12677: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12678: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12679: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12680: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12681: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12682: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12683: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12684: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12685: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12686: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12687: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12688: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12689: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  12690: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  12691: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  12692: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  12693: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12694: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  12695: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  12696: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  12697: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  12698: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  12699: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}

    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12701: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  12702: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  12703: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  12704: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  12705: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  12706: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  12707: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  12708: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  12709: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  12710: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  12711: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  12712: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  12713: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}

    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  12735: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'

    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  12738: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  12739: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  12740: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  12741: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  12742: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  12743: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    ${name-player} and I are throwing no tantrums, Luto.
    You speak of our trial in “tandem.”${prompt}

    Hmm? “Tandem?” What does that mean again?${prompt}
  13005: |-
    A charming slip of the tongue, dear Luto.
    It's a trial in “tandem,” you know?${prompt}

    That would be “trial in tandem,” Luto.
    I suggest you remember it.${prompt}

  13012: Hm? Did I misspeak?${prompt}
  13013: |-
    Who cares!
    What matters is that the two of you are back, and positively brimming with vim, vigor, and vitality from the look of it!${prompt}
  13014: |-
    Yes. One could say I'm feeling decent enough.
    I suppose I owe the two of you my thanks.${prompt}
  13015: |-
    You don't know the half of it, Luto!
    I feel like I could take on the world, and it's all thanks to you and ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13016: |-
    I must admit, I'm feeling quite energized.
    I owe you and ${name-player} here a debt of gratitude.${prompt}
  13017: |-
    It is as if a spring of newfound power wells up from within me.
    You and ${name-player} have my sincere gratitude.${prompt}

  13019: |-
    You know it, Luto.
    There's no feeling finer than that of surpassing your limits, and it's you and ${name-player} here that have made it possible.${prompt}
  13020: |-
    Why, yes, I feel excellent. It's even done wonders for my complexion.
    How can I ever thank the two of you?${prompt}
  13021: |-
    You bet, Luto!
    These are the days I feel alive, and I owe it all to you and ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13022: |-
    Truly, it's as if I've been reborn.
    You and ${name-player} have my deepest gratitude.${prompt}
  13023: |-
    Aw, Luto. You sure know how to make a girl feel good about herself!
    My energy level is off the charts, and I've got you and ${name-player} to thank for it!${prompt}
  13024: |-
    I do not exaggerate when I say that it is as if I am ten times the woman I was.
    How can I ever repay the two of you?${prompt}
  13025: |-
    Why, yes. These trials have got my blood stirring as nothing before.
    I owe much to this Magian Mooglehood...and the two of you, I suppose.${prompt}
  13026: |-
    Don't mention it!
    Nothing pleases me more than being able to perform a favor for my frrriends.${prompt}
  13027: |-
    ...But hey, that's all I can do for today.
    Business just isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.${prompt}
  13028: |-
    Oh well, then.
    You know where to find me if you need me, ${name-player}.
    I...look forward to our next adventure together.${prompt}
  13029: |-
    Truly a shame! And here I was ready to set right off on my next assignment.
    Fortunately, ${name-player} and I still have many adventures ahead!
    Isn't that right, my friend?${prompt}
  13030: |-
    Alas, but there is nothing to be done.
    Well, ${name-player}. When you next feel the call of adventure, you know where to find me.${prompt}
  13031: |-
    I suppose I cannot complain, as it is a plight I brought upon myself.
    Well, ${name-player}, shall we go adventuring in the meantime?${prompt}
  13032: |-
    Aw man, what a bummer!
    Why don't we take our frustrations out on some nasty fiends, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13033: |-
    Let's not let the rough times get us down, ${name-player}.
    Adventure calls, and like a lady, we'd best not keep her waiting!${prompt}
  13034: |-
    ...I see. Well, ${name-player}, it would seem this is as good a time as any for our next adventure.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  13035: |-
    Yikes! That's a shame.
    Good thing there's still plenty of adventures out there to be had! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13036: |-
    These must be difficult times indeed.
    Still, as long as ${name-player} and I are together, we can find our own adventure. Is that not so?${prompt}
  13037: |-
    Aw, Luto, that's really too bad!
    Well, ${name-player}, why don't we cheer ourselves up with an adventure or two?${prompt}
  13038: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, it would seem there is nothing for us to do but go in search of our own adventure.
    Shall we be off?${prompt}
  13039: |-
    Then I bid you farewell for now, Luto.
    And you, ${name-player}. I thirst for adventure, and I trust that you will answer the call.${prompt}
  13040: |-
    ...That unflagging adventurer's spirit.
    Nearly brrrings a tear to my eye, it does.${prompt}

    My ol' adventurer's intuition has never steered me wrong before, and it told me to come here at this very moment!
    Let's be off, ${name-player}! I can already hear an adventurous etude playing for us in Ru'Lude.${prompt}

    There is no need for surprise; this will be our fourth undertaking, after all.
    So, shall we be on our way shortly, ${name-player}?${prompt}

    We've done this more times than I can count, Luto! Of course I know when and where my mentor will show up!

    I may very well know ${name-player} better than ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] knows ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] after our various outings together, so ascertaining ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] location was no trouble at all.

  13074: |-
    I had an inkling that today would be the day, and lo and behold, it is! I'm so lucky!
    Or maybe it's because ${name-player} and I have already journeyed together so often?${prompt}
  13075: |-
    Such acumen may very well be thanks to the bonds we have forged together in battle, Luto.
    ${name-player}, I am at your service. Might I suggest we first make our way to the Ru'Lude Gardens?${prompt}
  13076: |-
    Maybe doing all these trials in tandewhatsit has bestowed us with some magical connective powers?
    I don't know why, but I just had a feeling that ${name-player} would be here today. Gee, I'm so glad I listened to that hunch!${prompt}
  13077: |-
    This ability--if it can even be called that--is merely the byproduct of our shared experiences.
    ${name-player}, I shall expend my utmost effort in this new trial. I trust you will do the same as well.${prompt}
  13078: |-
    This will be our fourth trial in tandem. I did not get this far by ignoring ${name-player}'s behavior.

  13119: |-
    Whew, that's one obstacle down. You're on your own from here on out, but you know the prrroverb: when Altana gives you Azouph greens, charm a chocobo.♪
    Anyway, I wish you the best of luck!${prompt}
  13120: |-
    Oh ho. I see you're still both in one piece. Congratulations then on your trrriumph.
    How do you feel? Have you noticed any changes since your departure?${prompt}
  13121: |-
    As tedious as these trials are, I think I'm ready for another. Why, this is the strongest I've felt since I kicked that little...
    No, I'd best not say any more.${prompt}
  13122: Now I'm light as a cloud and tough as a tree! My hands can hit what even my eyes don't see!${prompt}
  13123: I'm not half bad. I wager I could go one-on-one with the Shadow Lord and barely even break a sweat.${prompt}
  13124: I feel quite empowered, thank you. All my senses seem heightened to the point where, for a fleeting moment, I almost questioned my mortality.${prompt}
  13125: What can I say? I'm ready to sink my teeth deep into the next job and tear off a chunk of absolute victory!${prompt}
  13126: |-
    I feel good enough to ask you out to dinner with me next week.
    Stay that thought! I'm not sure you're ready for me yet, my dear.${prompt}
  13127: This is a wonderful feeling. I am quite sure that were I to gaze into a mirror, all my senses as well as my face would be given point.${prompt}
  13128: I've never felt anything like this! I could take on all the evil in Vana'diel and emerge unscathed, to say nothing of your next task for me!${prompt}
  13129: This is a splendid feeling indeed. A simple wave of my hand seems sufficient to accomplish even the most arduous of tasks.${prompt}
  13130: |-
    This feeling is the best! It's like I huffed and puffed and blew down a wall that was blocking me!
    Now, what would you call that? A boundary bust, maybe?${prompt}
  13131: What a spectacular sensation. I can feel an unbelievable power welling up from the very depths of my being, surging through my limbs...${prompt}
  13132: I feel like I could claim all the world with a swift stroke of martial justice that's been sharpened upon my newly heightened senses.${prompt}
  13133: It's good to see you're enjoying your powerrrs.${prompt}
  13134: |-
    And while I'd like to rrreward your vim with an equally vigorous assignment, I don't have any right now.
    As I'm out of other ideas, why not continue training with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13135: I suppose if there's nothing better to do...${prompt}
  13136: You won't be sorry, Luto. I promise to be so valiant that you'll hear minstrels singing my praises before I even return!${prompt}
  13137: If that's how it is, that's how it is. I have no qualms with more training.${prompt}
  13138: As long as you suggest such a course of action, Luto, I shall heed your sage advice.${prompt}
  13139: |-
    You're abso-truly-complelutely fine with me training some more!?
    You're the greatest, Luto!${prompt}
  13140: How do you always know exactly what to say to me, Luto? A purrrfect response, if I do say so myself.${prompt}
  13141: That would be simply divine! What a wonderful idea, Luto.${prompt}
  13142: |-
    Really!? Can I!?
    Then I'm going slay so many monsters that I'll forget why I'm slaying them in the first place!${prompt}
  13143: You are more than kind, Luto, and I shall avail myself of your generous offer.${prompt}
  13144: |-
    They say faith makes you stronger, and I have crates of faith in both you and ${name-player}!
    A little more training and I should be almost invincible!${prompt}
  13145: I shan't question your acumen, Luto. If that is what you suggest, I shall devote myself to training as thoroughly as possible.${prompt}
  13146: |-
    Is that your consent I hear?
    Then ${name-player} and I shall form an army of two, leaving nothing but a wake of utter destruction in our path.${prompt}
  13147: Don't pull any punches, either. I think it'd be the cat's meow if you come back even strrronger.${prompt}
  13148: The same goes for you, ${name-player}. You wouldn't want the disciple to become the masterrr, would you?♪${prompt}
  13149: The faster we depart, the faster we can finish this errand. Therefore, I'll be taking my leave now.${prompt}
  13150: I'll forge the way for us, ${name-player}! Just make sure you don't fall too far behind!${prompt}
  13151: I'll take the lead on this one and let you bring up the rear, ${name-player}. Rendezvous with me when you're able.${prompt}
  13152: |-
    I beg your leave.
    I apologize for my early departure, ${name-player}, but I shan't be too far ahead.${prompt}
  13153: I'm going to run on ahead, ${name-player}. Catch up with me if you can!${prompt}
  13154: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, I'm going on ahead. Just call my name if you find yourself in trouble.
    ...And here's looking at you, Luto. You're welcome to join us anytime.${prompt}
  13155: Well, I'm off. Remember, ${name-player}, no dilly-dallying. Finish what you have to do, then hurry right along.${prompt}
  13156: |-
    I can barely contain myself. I mean I can't contain myself at all!
    You better not linger long, ${name-player}, or there won't be any monsters left for you to practice on!${prompt}
  13157: |-
    And this is where I take my leave.
    Should you require my presence, ${name-player}, simply say the word and it shall take me mere moments to appear at your side.${prompt}
  13158: |-
    I'm going to leave now so I can start training right away.
    You're going to be so proud of me, ${name-player}. I just know it!${prompt}
  13159: |-
    Please excuse me, I must be going now.
    If you would be so kind as to let me know when you leave, ${name-player}, I would be extremely appreciative.${prompt}
  13160: "Good-bye, Luto. \nAnd ${name-player}, if you don't make haste after your conversation's finished, the consequences will be...how should I say...excruciating?\nBwahaha!${prompt}"
  13161: Hmmm. I should prrrobably get this business back up and running soon.${prompt}
  13162: I realize that capable adventurers like you and your friend won't stay satisfied with trrraining missions forever, now, will you?${prompt}
  13163: Maybe my old scrrratching post will help me come up with some good ideas to get back on track.${prompt}
  13164: Anyway, get out there and rrraise hell, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13165: "I knew you'd be back, ${name-player}. \nYou seem to sense exactly when I'm in the mood for your special serrrvices.${prompt}"
  13166: |-
    Oh, you. Stop prrretending to be such a kitten.
    We both know how quickly you get down to business.${prompt}
  13167: |-
    And that business starts with taking another missive to that hoary hairball in the Ru'Lude Gardens.

  13176: The only kind of magnetism you possess is the type that repels paying jobs. How much shall I wager that this is just another training mission?${prompt}
  13177: |-
    Your whiskers really told you that, Luto? Because I came here after my adventurer's sense began tingling!
    We're so alike that we should start a business together! One where I get to do real jobs and not just train all the time!${prompt}
  13178: I assume this is just the usual training excursion? Would you be kind enough to remind me what sort of business we're running, again?${prompt}
  13179: |-
    Your mental acuity is most laudable, Luto. I expected nothing less from my employer.
    I shall expend my utmost effort in hopes this training will lead to more steady work.${prompt}
  13180: Awww, another trial in tandem? Just how many of these things are there!?${prompt}
  13181: A new training mission, eh? Well, I'm certainly not one to pass up a chance at impressing the ladies...especially after how I wowed the crowd last time.${prompt}
  13182: Thank you for thinking of me and ${name-player}, Luto. It's just such a shame these trials never lead to actual work...${prompt}
  13183: Yes! Another chance for me to kick some serious monster tuchus! Still, when I think of how we haven't gotten any work in forever...I...I...waaahhh!${prompt}
  13184: |-
    It's time once again for a trial in tandem, is it?
    Of course, I'm completely fine with undertaking this task so crucial to my own development, but--if I may--it does seem a tad suspicious that we never actually receive any job offers.${prompt}
  13185: You mean we're going off on another tangemawhatsit? Then I have to dig down deep and find my inner strength so we can bop those baddies and get some real work!${prompt}
  13186: "Your perspicacity is nonpareil, Luto. I wouldn't want to work under anyone else. \nI'm quite confident that after this training mission, work is one thing we shall not be in want of.${prompt}"
  13187: Another one of these cursed trials!? As much as the sight of scattered monster entrails beneath my bootheel excites me, I can't subsist on excitement alone! What about some real work!?${prompt}
  13188: |-
    Heh heh heh. You may think this is just another trial in tandem, but you'd be wrrrong.
    Your ever-resourceful boss has sifted through Jeuno's litterbox of a marketplace and finally come up with a gem of a job! Ha, whoever said, “Curiosity killed the cat” was dumb as a dagon!${prompt}
  13189: 'Our grrracious client''s only request was that we collect ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}'

    It's like getting two goldfish with one scoop of the paw!${prompt}
  13191: Oh...I see. Excuse me, but before we go, I have to dry these premature tears of disappointment I started shedding.${prompt}
  13192: |-
    Yeeeaaah!
    It's time to go a-smashin' and a-bashin' and a-crashin' in the name of good, old-fashioned work!
    Let's grab this opportunity by the horns and shake it 'til they break off! It's Ru'Lude or bust, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13193: |-
    Well, another job had to come eventually. It might as well be now.
    Come on, ${name-player}--to the gardens.${prompt}
  13194: |-
    What a welcome development, Luto. I promise not to disappoint you in this entrepreneurial venture.
    I assume you do not want to disappoint her either, ${name-player}? Then let us depart for Ru'Lude.${prompt}
  13195: |-
    I knew you'd pull through for us, Luto! Yay! We finally did it!
    A chocobo in the stable is worth two in the bush, so let's ride on over to Ru'Lude before our meal ticket leaves town, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13196: |-
    This is just the chance I need to prove how dashing and daring I can be. Be forewarned, Luto, lest you fall so hard for me that you can't get back up.
    ${name-player}. You, me, Ru'Lude. Now.${prompt}
  13197: |-
    Oh my, what impeccable timing! And here I was just thinking how nice it would be if we could see some work drift our way. It must be fate!
    Come now, ${name-player}, it's off to Ru'Lude for us.${prompt}
  13198: |-
    Then I'm the girl for you! Just you wait and see, we'll appease the moogle and have us all swimming in a sea of gil!
    C'mon, ${name-player}, we've not a moment to waste!${prompt}
  13199: |-
    What a pleasant surprise. Thank you for your tireless effort in procuring us employment, Luto.
    May this endeavor prove fruitful for us both, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13200: It's been so long since my last assignment, I think I might've forgotten how to fight, tee hee. Maybe you could teach me again after we visit the magician moogle, ${name-player}? Anyway, toodleoo until Ru'Lude!${prompt}
  13201: |-
    I'm elated to hear we finally have an official assignment.
    ${name-player}, let's both exert as much effort as possible to maximize our employability. For now, though, let us make haste to the Ru'Lude Gardens and the magian moogle.${prompt}
  13202: |-
    Now that's something to get your heart pumping!
    A trial and a job all in one!? So, I get to thrash the dirty hides of fiendish brutes for money? Lace my boots and call me ready!${prompt}

    So, how'd it feel working for the Man--er, Mithra?${prompt}
  13214: |-
    It was refreshing to feel something other than frustration at this eternal struggle for self-betterment.
    I guess it was nice to have been of service, too.${prompt}
  13215: |-
    Just the sight of ${name-player} and me was so imposing that they cowered and ran away without a fight!
    Next time, could you give us something a little more meaty and flavorful?${prompt}
  13216: "Pffft. I could've gotten a wagonful of those things without a problem. \nI don't know if I could even call what we just did “work.”${prompt}"
  13217: It was a valuable learning experience. It will also be liberating to finally not have to rely on my parents for pecuniary aid.${prompt}
  13218: |-
    Why'd you give us such an easy job with barely any clashing, bashing, or mashing?
    Don't think you can coddle me just 'cause I called you my big sister once!${prompt}
  13219: |-
    That was a nice bit of exercise. My muscles are rippling even more than when we set out.
    Fighting beside ${name-player} was all fine and well, but how about you and I meet for a midnight spar sometime, Luto?${prompt}
  13220: Thank you for asking, Luto! Well, knowing I contributed to society this time has given me an even more powerful sense of accomplishment! Without a doubt, I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.${prompt}
  13221: |-
    I'm so worked up I can't even describe how I feel! I was all like, “Boom,” “Hya,” “Shaaa,” the whole time!
    I haven't felt like this in sooo long!${prompt}
  13222: It was both a pleasure and an honor to successfully execute such a significant assignment with ${name-player}. That alone is enough of a reward, and yet I was blessed with this new feeling of empowerment as well. I simply could not be any happier.${prompt}
  13223: It's like I doubled my treasure, doubled my fun, and doubled my power with...ummm, how's that go again? ${prompt}
  13224: It was an invaluable experience and a wonderful opportunity to improve not only my own, but someone else's life as well. I thank you for giving me such a chance, Luto.${prompt}

    Oh, the rush! You wouldn't believe it! I've never felt so alive as when I was killing monsters...for the sake of others!
    I'm eternally indebted to you, Luto.${prompt}

    Glad to see you grrrabbed this job by the throat and shook the life out of it.

  13236: |-
    Luto, don't say that in front of me! It's disgusting!
    Uh, I mean the throat-shaking thing, not the getting-another-job thing! I'd love another chance to help a fellow citizen in need!
    Anywho, bye-byebees, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13237: I shall stay ever vigilant until that time--eyes peeled, searching for denizens in need. Should you wish to accompany me, ${name-player}, dally not long, for evil never rests!${prompt}

    I like your style, Luto! That's the same way I would've put it, except maybe with a bit more blood and leather. Hahaha!

    Buy a storage slip.
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  13251: |-
    Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?
    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  13252: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  13253: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  13254: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  13255: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  13256: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}

    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  13258: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}

  13260: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}

    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  13262: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  13263: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  13264: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}

  13266: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  13267: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  13268: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}

  13303: |-
    They're a subterranean race of beastmen that strikingly resemble moles.
    No need to get your britches in a bunch if you haven't, though--studying them is our job.${prompt}
  13304: |-
    We, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, have left no stone--figurative or real--unturned in our search for answers about this elusive species.
    Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13305: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work throughout a network of burrows.${prompt}
  13306: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13307: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?

    Finally, while there are many types of grimoires, they all share the same attributes.

  13323: You must be the explorer my compatriot in Jeuno was talking about. What brings you here?${prompt}
  13324: "Well, well, look who it is. \nWhat do you need this time?${prompt}"
  13325: Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.${prompt}
  13326: We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  13327: I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for “nefarious deeds” once again.${prompt}
  13328: |-
    Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives!
    Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.${prompt}
  13329: How, you ask? By collecting as much information as possible through new expeditions and finally getting to the bottom of this Moblin nuisance! We're always in need of proven researchers like yourself, should you wish to join in the action.${prompt}

    What are research marks?
    Can you tell me about the Meebles?
    What is grimoire engraving?
    Could you tell me about wizened worms?
    Palimpsests? Huh?${prompt}
  13333: |-
    You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.
    The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt}
  13334: |-
    Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.
    Be careful.${prompt}
  13335: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt}
  13336: |-
    Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.
    However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt}
  13337: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt}
  13338: |-
    Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.
    Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.${prompt}
  13339: |-
    What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.
    Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt}
  13340: |-
    Like I said, they're no picture books for children.
    They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.${prompt}
  13341: |-
    These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice!
    See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.${prompt}
  13342: Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions.
    Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.${prompt}
  13344: 'At the moment we only have ${number: 0} types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.${prompt}'
  13345: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt}
  13346: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to me.${prompt}
  13347: 'Once you do that, ${choice: 0}[he''ll/I''ll/I''ll] dole out ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13348: Those're the only supplies you'll need to start spelunking, but not so fast. You first have to decide what expedition you'll undertake.${prompt}
  13349: I'll help you make the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13350: |-
    It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots.
    The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13351: Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.${prompt}
  13352: 'It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you''re allowed to choose any expedition you''ve already proven your worth on.${prompt}'
  13353: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt}
  13354: 'After signing up, you''ll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt}'
  13355: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt}
  13356: |-
    ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.
    I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt}
  13357: |-
    Don't worry, this method is tried and true.
    Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt}
  13358: 'That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you''re the only one who isn''t carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they''ll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt}'
  13359: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt}
  13360: 'Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you''re free to experiment all you want.${prompt}'
  13361: '...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt}'
  13362: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt}
  13363: 'Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt}'
  13364: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt}

  13367: 'One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt}'
  13368: 'After making your escape, there''s only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'

    There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.

    Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.
    Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt}
  13376: |-
    Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.
    That's why.${prompt}
  13377: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt}
  13378: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt}
  13379: |-
    That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.
    Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13380: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt}
  13381: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt}
  13382: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt}
  13383: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt}
  13384: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt}
  13385: 'Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren''t stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt}'
  13386: |-
    That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).
    We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt}

    We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...
    How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt}
  13389: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt}
  13390: |-
    On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.
    Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt}
  13391: |-
    I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.
    If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt}
  13392: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt}
  13393: 'In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You''ll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt}'
  13394: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt}
  13395: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13396: |-
    How do you get them? It's simple.
    The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt}
  13397: |-
    There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.
    The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt}
  13398: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13399: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt}
  13400: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13401: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  13402: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13403: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt}
  13404: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt}
  13405: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt}
  13406: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt}
  13407: |-
    Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.
    Let me explain.${prompt}
  13408: 'If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt}'
  13409: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt}
  13410: |-
    Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.
    It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt}
  13411: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt}
  13412: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt}
  13413: |-
    Palimpsests?
    I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt}
  13414: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt}
  13415: |-
    Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.
    Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt}
  13416: |-
    Except it's not!
    Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt}
  13417: |-
    Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.
    These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt}
  13418: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt}
  13419: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt}
  13420: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt}

  13781: I imagine it'll be quite difficultaru, but if you find any information that might help him, can you please let him know?${prompt}
  13782: Oh, remember that I always welcome any astral notebooks-wotebooks that you might find!${prompt}
  13783: Hey, that looks-wooks like an astral notebook!${prompt}
  13784: 'Or maybe not!${sound: 30}${prompt}'
  13785: Wait a momentaru, could this be...${prompt}
  13786: Whoa! What is this!?${prompt}
  13787: This thing really fires up my engineering spirit!${prompt}
  13788: Hm? Did this thing really fly with humans riding-widing it?${prompt}
  13789: Really!? I've got to repair it right away!${prompt}
  13790: The damage to the chassis can be fixed. The problem is the engine...${prompt}
  13791: Let's see... This goes like this... Which means that this...${prompt}
  13792: Hmm... Wait a moment. This here is...${prompt}
  13793: What is it?${prompt}
  13794: I feel as if I've seen this before...${prompt}
  13795: 'I know! I saw it in ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}!${prompt}'
  13796: 'Wait! Isn''t ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} that place in the north with the ruins-wuins? What were you doing there!?${prompt}'
  13797: Well, I heard a rumor from an adventurer and decided to go check it out on my day off...${prompt}
  13798: That place sure was dangerous! It was so cold that as soon as my nose started running, it froze to my face! I thought I was done for.${prompt}
  13799: Anyways, back to this machine here! So you see, I haven't actually seen the real thing. I think it was displayed on some sort of device.${prompt}
  13800: 'Therefore, we''ll need to go back to ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} to find a clue about how to get this thing working!${prompt}'
  13801: Now that's enough of that! If you get yourself killed-willed, who's going to repair the stethoscope!?${prompt}
  13802: Umm... Wh-when you put it like that... I don't know.${prompt}
  13803: 'Oh, I got it! Maybe you could go to ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} and search for clues for me?${prompt}'
  13804: I'll keep examining this thing here. And deal with the stethoscope too, of course...${prompt}
  13805: Good luck out there!${prompt}
  13806: '${lettercase: 1}${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}... I hear it''s quite an unusual place, to say the leastaru. I feel there''s definitely something there.${prompt}'
  13807: Let me know if you find anything out there. Be careful that your nose-wose doesn't freeze off either.${prompt}
  13808: 'By the way, did you happen-wappen to find anything in ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}?${prompt}'
  13809: Huh!? Is that...!?${prompt}
  13810: I think you're overreacting a bit...${prompt}
  13811: Besides, it looks like we've got ourselves a new clue!${prompt}
  13812: Amazing! This is exactly what we needed!${prompt}
  13813: 'I took the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} apart for repairs, and there was something just like it in there. Give me a moment to replace it...${prompt}'
  13814: All finished! Let's give it a try, shall we?${prompt}
  13815: Get ready to take off!${prompt}
  13816: Huh!? The chocobos! Waitaru!
  13817: I made a slight mistake with the tuning. Here, I'll fix it right away.${prompt}
  13818: There, it should be fine now.${prompt}
  13819: Well? Care to give it a try?${prompt}
  13820: (I'd be scared too if I were you...)${prompt}
  13821: Alright! It worked!${prompt}
  13822: Okay now, I want you to use it.${prompt}
  13823: I thoughtaru you were making this for yourself, Jeridade.${prompt}
  13824: This Levitus... Oh, that seems to be this mount's name. It's carved into the seat.${prompt}
  13825: Anyways, I'll make my own once I develop a new engine. I think I can use the old one for reference.${prompt}
  13826: Now then... I need to go out and get some parts.${prompt}
  13827: Jeridade! What's got you all excited now!?${prompt}
  13828: Hey! Stop! Don't you run away from me!${prompt}
  13829: Ahh... Looks like he got away...${prompt}
  13830: 'I wonder how this can be register-wegistered in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  13831: 'Hm? This hasn''t been registered in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} yet!?${prompt}'
  13832: That reminds me... Didn't it just register itself automatically last time?${prompt}
  13833: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... I guess there''s something about these older vehicles. I better have Jeridade look into the matter-watter in more detail!${prompt}'
  13834: Hmm... What is the meaning of this...${prompt}
  13835: For now, it looks like you can summon-wummon it, so I'll ask Jeridade about it. I'll be sure to research it myself too!${prompt}
  13836: 'x=${number: 0} y=${number: 1} z=${number: 2}${prompt}'
  13837: 'Ah, how lovely! Let me register your ${item-singular: 0[2]} in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13838: 'Amazing-wazing! That''s ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13839: Wait...I remember reading-weading about the legendary noble chocobos in a treatise by the esteemed Markovich. “Legendary Chocobos of Our Time,” I believe that title was.${prompt}
  13840: Chocobos with such cherry-colored coatarus are of royal lineage and are only born during very specific times of the year.${prompt}
  13841: You must be very special-wecial indeed to have procured such a wonderful companion. I hope you enjoy them!${prompt}
  13842: Oh, what I wouldn't give to ride one!${prompt}
  13843: At the very least, please let me pet them!${prompt}
  13844: 'Either way, let me register your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13845: 'With this, you should now be able to mount ${choice: 2}[a chocobo/a raptor/a tiger/a crab/a red crab/a bomb/a sheep/a morbol/a crawler/Fenrir/a beetle/a moogle/a magic pot/a tulfaire/a warmachine/a xzomit/a hippogryph/a spectral chair/a spheroid/Omega/a coeurl/a goobbue/a raaz/Levitus/an adamantoise/a dhalmel/a doll/a golden bomb/a buffalo/a wivre/a red raptor/an iron giant/Byakko/a noble chocobo/an ixion/a phuabo].${prompt}'
  13846: Ahh, welcome. Did you happen-wappen to bring an astral notebook with you?${prompt}
  13847: It appears not. Although, I see you have something else you wish for me to take a looksie-wooksie at.${prompt}
  13848: Now then, let me see what you've got there...${prompt}
  13849: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} showed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  13850: Hmm... Yes, I see... Oh no!${prompt}
  13851: It seems-weems that I've done it again...${prompt}
  13852: Anyways, this appears to be rather old music. Indeed, it has piqued my interestaru.${prompt}
  13853: Of course, I'm no archaeologistaru or anything. Please tell me if you learn anything new.${prompt}
  13854: 'Hey! That''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Allow me to register-wegister it in the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13855: Hmm... It's not working for some reason. Please give me a momentaru to check it out.${prompt}
  13856: What is going on here? Oh no, not again!${prompt}
  13857: It seems I was careless-wareless.${prompt}
  13858: Huh? The music-wusic from before was decoded and registered!?${prompt}
  13859: I see... People from the pastaru must've performed the same research I did...${prompt}
  13860: Just thinking about it fills me with a sense-wense of romanticism.${prompt}
  13861: Okay! I've got to give it my very best effortaru!${prompt}
  13862: 'Even a small donation of ${number: 0} gil would allow me to provide medicine to any patient who may need it.${prompt}'
  13863: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.${prompt}
  13864: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.。${prompt}
  13865: Your recent donation is more than sufficient for the time being. Perhaps I will run out and request your services again later.${prompt}
  13866: 'Would you happen to be in possession of any ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]}? I require some to further my research, but they can be quite expensive to procure on my own.${prompt}'
  13867: 'Thank you very much for the ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}. I''m sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego''s capabilities.${prompt}'
  13868: 'Thank you very much for the ${item-plural: 0[2]}. I''m sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego''s capabilities.${prompt}'
  13869: Thank you very much for such expensive medicines. I'm sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego's capabilities.${prompt}
  13870: I should have more than enough concoctions for my current needs.${prompt}
  13871: 'I should have more than enough ${item-plural: 0[2]} for my current needs.${prompt}'
  13872: Let us hope that those at Salahaam's Sentinels keep up their end of the bargain...${prompt}
  13873: Ah. And you must be...${prompt}
  13874: ${name-player}. Of course. Your reputation precedes you.${prompt}
  13875: I am well aware of the deeds you have performed for me via your connections in Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt}
  13876: But where are my manners? I have yet to introduce myself.${prompt}
  13877: I am Elijah, but a humble member of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.).${prompt}
  13878: I have acquired some information about threats that need to be vanquished as part of your excellent work in the Records of Eminence initiative.${prompt}
  13879: I am loath to admit that these foes may be beneath your station, but I would ask you to remove them nonetheless.${prompt}
  13880: |-
    Accept the request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  13881: You have my gratitude. Allow me to provide you with the relevant intel.${prompt}
  13882: Unfortunate, but not altogether unexpected.${prompt}
  13883: Your quarry resides on the continent of Aradjiah.${prompt}
  13884: Though I would ordinarily rely on local mercenaries for the task, this requires a more...delicate touch.${prompt}
  13885: I promise that the reward will be worthwhile. Double so if you bring proof of the kill.${prompt}
  13886: Should you be able to do so, that is...${prompt}
  13887: While I appreciate your efforts, I am only able to provide you with rewards once per month (Earth time).${prompt}
  13888: I am positive that we will be able to uncover more threats in the upcoming months.${prompt}
  13889: Of course, I will provide you with more information as circumstances warrant.${prompt}
  13890: Once again, your assistance is most appreciated.${prompt}
  13891: Thank you for setting the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  13892: May you strike true.${prompt}
  13893: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smirks at you.'
  13894: Well, well, if it isn't my favorite intrepid adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13895: You seem to have been quite busy of late, what with all the fiend slaying and equipment collecting going on.${prompt}
  13896: And in between all your marauding, you still found time to deal with Falak. Heroism truly is your most impressive attribute.${prompt}
  13897: You've really helped me to regain my faith in humanity.${prompt}
  13898: And given your track record and breadth of talents, I would ask another favor of you.${prompt}
  13899: And just as before, this will be handled via Records of Eminence. Have to make sure all the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed, as you know.${prompt}
  13900: For you see, the fiends I hunt are not just limited to Aradjiah.${prompt}
  13901: Although it does seem they aimed to break a particular seal...${prompt}
  13902: '...this time they aim to lay claim to the World Eater Egg. No, this simply will not do.${prompt}'
  13903: This goes directly against the will of my master, and I shall suffer none to cross him.${prompt}
  13904: I trust you will vanquish this threat with all due haste.${prompt}
  13905: We're counting on you, hero.${prompt}
  13906: Pleasure as always, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13907: Your fervor in vanquishing those which threaten us all has not gone unappreciated.${prompt}
  13908: Although perhaps you were only assisting me for baubles and glory rather than righteousness and justice, I must thank you all the same.${prompt}
  13909: So without further ado, permit me to introduce you to your next targets.${prompt}
  13910: You are to make for Aydeewa and Arrapago.${prompt}
  13911: It appears that the dead have redoubled their efforts to usher in the egg's hatching, and it has already been brought to the reef.${prompt}
  13912: And if we can hinder their efforts...well, suffice it to say that my lord will be quite pleased indeed.${prompt}
  13913: Though I would normally be content to leave the dead well alone, I fear that his will is indeed absolute in this matter.${prompt}
  13914: Of course, I need not tell you that for every one you strike down two more will doubtless take its place. I can think of no task more Sisyphean.${prompt}
  13915: Were it up to me, I would see the entire place set ablaze.${prompt}
  13916: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.${prompt}
  13917: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.${prompt}
  13918: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.${prompt}
  13919: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.${prompt}
  13920: Goddesspeed, hero.${prompt}
  13921: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.${prompt}
  13922: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.${prompt}
  13923: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.${prompt}
  13924: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.${prompt}
  13925: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt}
  13926: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.${prompt}
  13927: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.${prompt}
  13928: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.${prompt}
  13929: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.${prompt}
  13930: “Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them.”${prompt}
  13931: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.${prompt}
  13932: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...${prompt}
  13933: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the “stragglers,” then so be it.${prompt}
  13934: I will fill my charge without fail.${prompt}
  13935: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.${prompt}
  13936: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.${prompt}
  13937: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.${prompt}
  13938: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13939: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.${prompt}
  13940: I wish you the best of luck.${prompt}
  13941: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?${prompt}
  13942: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.${prompt}
  13943: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.${prompt}
  13944: Pleasure to see you, ${name-player}. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?${prompt}
  13945: “What buffoons?” Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.${prompt}
  13946: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.${prompt}
  13947: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?${prompt}
  13948: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?${prompt}
  13949: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!${prompt}
  13950: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.${prompt}
  13951: |-
    But setting that small matter aside...
    You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?${prompt}
  13952: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.${prompt}
  13953: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.${prompt}
  13954: |-
    Haha...
    Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13955: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.${prompt}
  13956: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.${prompt}
  13957: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.${prompt}
  13958: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...${prompt}
  13959: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.${prompt}
  13960: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.${prompt}
  13961: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?${prompt}
  13962: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.${prompt}
  13963: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.${prompt}
  13964: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.${prompt}
  13965: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little “agreement.”${prompt}
  13966: You see, ${name-player}, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13967: And we are always watching...listening...${prompt}
  13968: Ah, ${name-player}. Somehow, I knew you would come.${prompt}
  13969: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  13970: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?${prompt}
  13971: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?${prompt}
  13972: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.${prompt}
  13973: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.${prompt}
  13974: 'But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.${prompt}'
  13975: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.${prompt}
  13976: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.${prompt}
  13977: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.${prompt}
  13978: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.${prompt}
  13979: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.${prompt}
  13980: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.${prompt}
  13981: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.${prompt}
  13982: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.${prompt}
  13983: I need not spell out for you what that implied.${prompt}
  13984: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.${prompt}
  13985: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.${prompt}
  13986: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.${prompt}
  13987: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.${prompt}
  13988: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.${prompt}
  13989: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?${prompt}
  13990: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.${prompt}
  13991: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.${prompt}
  13992: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?${prompt}
  13993: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.${prompt}
  13994: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.${prompt}
  13995: That is enough stories for one day.${prompt}
  13996: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.${prompt}
  13997: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.${prompt}
  13998: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...${prompt}
  13999: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smiles at you.'
  14000: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah begins laughing boisterously!'
  14001: ${name-player}. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.${prompt}
  14002: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.${prompt}
  14003: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.${prompt}
  14004: Of course, we have no choice but to answer in kind.${prompt}
  14005: Yet moving too hastily has caused the downfall of many, so I would ask for your aid once more.${prompt}
  14006: The first issue is dealing with the defectors amongst the beastmen who have joined forces with Chaos.${prompt}
  14007: Unfortunately, their contingent is present not only in the Middle Lands, but Aht Urhgan and the Far East as well.${prompt}
  14008: With the enemy spread out across the world, I have had to dispatch some of my most loyal retainers to the far reaches of the globe.${prompt}
  14009: While they are dealing with the threat above, you will deal with Garazu-Horeizu at the gate between this world and the next.${prompt}
  14010: Of course, this will allow the gate to be opened.${prompt}
  14011: I will take up the rear guard, so you have not to fear.${prompt}
  14012: Ah, but perhaps you are concerned that my protection alone may prove insufficient.${prompt}
  14013: |-
    Are you concerned?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Of course not!${prompt}
  14014: Then we shall continue along the same path we have traveled to date.${prompt}
  14015: Oho. I may not have a Prime Weapon, but I promise that my skills are more than sufficient.${prompt}
  14016: Then we have our tasks. Let us see them through.${prompt}
  14017: This is our watershed moment. We must defeat Garazu-Horeizu and his minions.${prompt}
  14018: Best of luck to us all.${prompt}
  14019: ${name-player}. It has been a spell, hasn't it?${prompt}
  14020: You did well in ridding us of Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos.${prompt}
  14021: I would venture to say that your performance exceeded my wildest expectations.${prompt}
  14022: So much so, in fact, that I find myself at a bit of a loss.${prompt}
  14023: The original plan involved my master having a bit more of a...pivotal role in the aftermath, so to speak.${prompt}
  14024: But you kept all the best parts for yourself.${prompt}
  14025: Still, he was quite pleased with how you presented yourself during the entire ordeal.${prompt}
  14026: And my efforts were rewarded in turn, as I have been permitted to remain in this world for a spell.${prompt}
  14027: A curse in disguise, if you will, for I had hoped to return to his side.${prompt}
