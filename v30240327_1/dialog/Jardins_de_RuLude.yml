  6821: As you command, my lord. I would give the very blood that runs in my veins if it were to further the cause of our kingdom. You can rely on me.${prompt}
  6822: These foreigners are wily and faithless. Never let down your guard, and may the Goddess of the Dawn protect you in Her mercy.${prompt}
  6823: The king has taken a beautiful queen, and I think a splendid addition to the royal family is not far off. An heir, perhaps...${prompt}
  6824: We people of San d'Oria, too, must ever look to the future. The Elvaan must never fall behind foreigners, in power or faith.${prompt}
  6825: I understand, Your Grace.${prompt}
  6826: Very good. Do well, Francmage.${prompt}

    Why must Humes and Galka be so irresponsible!?
    It is their fault for wandering off without telling us!${prompt}

    There are too few of us left to continue. I say we go back.

  6846: |-
    Yeah, you're right.
    This whole expedition was a failure. Let's head back tomorrow.${prompt}

    Ulrich.
    Tell me something... Was it really an accident?${prompt}
  6848: What do you mean?${prompt}

  6850: Are you accusing me of something, Elvaan?${prompt}
  6851: Hah! Calm down. I do not care if it was an accident or not. I care even less about your little country's problems.${prompt}
  6852: |-
    Just...do not cause any more trouble with such trivial matters while I am around.
    That is all.${prompt}

  10025: Hmph. Vous n'avez pas changé d'un iota, n'est-ce pas ? Vous devriez faire particulièrement attention, mon ami, de peur de le regretter un jour.${prompt}
  10026: Conseillez à votre ambassadeur d'éviter ces aventures imprudentes. Je reviendrai plus tard. Bonne journée.${prompt}
  10027: Hmm...${prompt}
  10028: Eh bien, je ne peux pas faire d'examens sans patient. Veuillez transmettre à l'ambassadeur que je suis désolé de l'avoir manqué, et que je repasserai plus tard.${prompt}
  10029: Le Seigneur Wolfgang est le capitaine de la garde de l'Archiduc Kam'lanaut. Mais je me demande quelle affaire il avait avec Son Excellence...${prompt}
  10030: Wolfgang est le capitaine de la garde de l'Archiduc Kam'lanaut. Dites, je me demande ce qu'il voulait avec Son Excellence...${prompt}
  10031: Wolfgang est le capitaine de la garde de l'Archiduc Kam'lanaut. J'aimerais bien savoir ce qu'il voulait avec Son Excellence, cependant...${prompt}
  10032: Ah, mais c'est une bonne chose que vous soyez ici ! Pourquoi ne pas aller à la Tour de Delkfutt et faire un rapport sur les progrès de l'ambassadeur ? Une tâche appropriée pour le nouveau venu !${prompt}
  10033: Hé, je sais ! Vous pouvez aller à la Tour de Delkfutt et nous dire comment il va. Pas mal pour votre première mission, non ?${prompt}
  10034: Bien sûr ! Pourquoi ne pas aller à la Tour de Delkfutt et voir comment il va ? Je sais que vous venez d'arriver, mais merci !${prompt}
  10035: Avancez prudemment, car l'endroit est infesté de monstres. Il serait sage de vous équiper en ville et de voyager en compagnie d'autres aventuriers.${prompt}
  10036: J'entends dire que cet endroit est infesté de monstres ! Assurez-vous de vous équiper en ville. Et n'y allez surtout pas seul.${prompt}
  10037: On dit que cet endroit abrite des monstres d'une puanteur immonde ! Faites le plein d'équipement en ville, et assurez-vous d'avoir une équipe pour vous protéger.${prompt}
  10038: Bien sûr, vous avez été promu pour une raison, donc j'ai la plus grande confiance en votre succès. Bonne chance à vous !${prompt}
  10039: Je sais que vous avez bien servi votre pays, donc je suis sûr que vous vous en sortirez bien. Allez-y, soldat !${prompt}
  10040: Vous êtes arrivé jusqu'ici, donc je suis sûr que vous ferez bien. Bonne chance !${prompt}
  10041: La Tour de Delkfutt est sur l'île de Qufim. Profitez des marchands en ville et assemblez une équipe d'autres aventuriers.${prompt}
  10042: Des bêtes immondes rôdent à chaque coin. Soyez sur vos gardes.${prompt}
  10043: La Tour de Delkfutt est sur l'île de Qufim. Faites le tour de la ville pour trouver de bonnes affaires sur l'équipement, et n'oubliez pas qu'il y a de la sécurité dans le nombre.${prompt}
  10044: Cet endroit est plein de monstres, alors faites attention${choice-player-gender}[, Jack./.]${prompt}
  10045: La Tour de Delkfutt est sur l'île de Qufim. N'oubliez pas de faire vos achats pour vous équiper. Et trouvez de l'aide pour vous accompagner... Vous en aurez besoin !${prompt}
  10046: Vous rencontrerez sûrement des compagnons peu agréables là-bas, alors soyez extrêmement prudent.${prompt}
  10047: Bienvenue. Son Excellence est revenue et vous attend. Venez, entrez dans son bureau.${prompt}
  10048: Bienvenue ! L'ambassadeur est revenu et a hâte de vous voir. Entrez dans son bureau.${prompt}
  10049: Bienvenue ! L'ambassadeur est revenu et veut vous voir. Il est dans son bureau.${prompt}
  10050: Ah, je suis tellement content de vous voir.${prompt}
  10051: Ah, vous voilà.${prompt}
  10052: Oh, vous êtes enfin de retour.${prompt}
  10053: Merci beaucoup d'avoir bravé les dangers pour me trouver. Vous avez toute ma reconnaissance. Maintenant, assez de formalités...${prompt}
  10054: Merci beaucoup d'avoir bravé les dangers pour me trouver. Je suis très reconnaissant. Passons maintenant aux choses sérieuses...${prompt}
  10055: Merci beaucoup d'avoir bravé les dangers pour me trouver. Vous avez toute ma reconnaissance. Maintenant, alors...${prompt}
  10056: Par la présente, je vous nomme, ${name-player}, au poste d'attaché à l'ambassade de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10057: Par la présente, je vous nomme, ${name-player}, au poste d'attaché à l'ambassade de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10058: Par la présente, je vous nomme, ${name-player}, au poste d'attaché à l'ambassade de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10059: Que vous appliquiez tous vos pouvoirs pour le bien de la patrie et son amitié avec Jeuno.${prompt}
  10060: Faites tout ce que vous pouvez pour votre pays et son amitié avec Jeuno.${prompt}
  10061: Puissiez-vous vous montrer utile à notre patrie et à son amitié avec Jeuno.${prompt}
  10062: Pour l'instant, consacrez vos efforts à notre juste conquête des régions avoisinantes de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10063: Pour l'instant, l'administration a besoin de votre aide pour la conquête et la sécurité des régions avoisinantes de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10064: Pour l'instant, nous avons besoin de votre aide pour la conquête. Nous voulons placer toutes les régions périphériques de Jeuno sous l'égide de Windurst.${prompt}
  10065: Prouvez votre valeur, et j'aurai peut-être besoin de vous plus tard. Quand ce moment viendra, j'espère que vous pourrez m'aider comme vous l'avez fait auparavant.${prompt}
  10066: Vous savez, il y a une certaine tâche spéciale qui pourrait vous intéresser plus tard. Ce n'est pas encore le moment, mais je penserai à vous.${prompt}
  10067: Ne vous éloignez pas trop, car je pourrais avoir besoin de vous plus tard. Quand ce moment viendra, j'espère que vous serez tout aussi utile que vous l'avez été auparavant.${prompt}
  10068: Pour l'instant, consacrez vos efforts à notre juste conquête des régions adjacentes à Jeuno.${prompt}
  10069: Pour l'instant, l'administration a besoin de votre aide pour la conquête et la sécurité des régions limitrophes de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10070: Pour l'instant, nous avons besoin de votre aide pour la conquête. Nous voulons placer toutes les régions périphériques de Jeuno sous l'égide de Windurst.${prompt}
  10071: Bienvenue, ${name-player}. Son Excellence a besoin de vos services. Une fois que vous aurez terminé votre mission actuelle, revenez et demandez audience auprès d'elle.${prompt}
  10072: Repos, soldat. L'ambassadeur veut vous parler. Une fois que vous aurez terminé votre mission actuelle, revenez rapidement !${prompt}
  10073: Bonjour, ${name-player}. Son Excellence a besoin de votre aide. Faites-nous une faveur et revenez une fois votre mission actuelle terminée, d'accord ?${prompt}
  10074: Son Excellence a besoin d'aide pour une affaire importante. Avancez, et écoutez bien.${prompt}
  10075: L'ambassadeur veut vous pour une opération spéciale. Rendez-vous au briefing, et vite !${prompt}
  10076: Son Excellence cherche votre aide pour quelque chose d'important. Allez dans la chambre arrière.${prompt}
  10077: Merci d'être venu, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10078: Merci de vous être porté volontaire, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10079: Merci d'être venu, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10080: Cette ambassade a reçu une demande de l'Archiduc de Jeuno pour envoyer quelqu'un pour une mission spéciale.${prompt}
  10081: Selon un message reçu de la Cour de Jeuno, ils veulent quelqu'un pour une mission spéciale.${prompt}
  10082: Nous avons reçu une demande de l'Archiduc de Jeuno pour envoyer quelqu'un pour une mission spéciale.${prompt}
  10083: En raison de votre service exemplaire à la Tour de Delkfutt, je vous considère comme le principal candidat.${prompt}
  10084: À la Tour de Delkfutt, vous avez fait preuve d'un courage au-delà du devoir. C'est pourquoi je veux que vous dirigiez cette mission.${prompt}
  10085: En raison de votre courage désintéressé à la Tour de Delkfutt, je veux vous recommander pour cette mission.${prompt}
  10086: Allez-vous servir ?${prompt}
  10087: Eh bien, que dites-vous ?${prompt}
  10088: Acceptez-vous ?${prompt}
  10089: Réussissez, et vous nous honorerez tous, ${name-player}. Je suis optimiste quant au fait que vous gagnerez la confiance de l'archiduc.${prompt}
  10090: Ce genre de mission est un grand honneur, ${name-player}. Je suis sûr que vous gagnerez la confiance de l'archiduc.${prompt}
  10091: Vos actions rejailliront sur nous tous, ${name-player}. Je suis sûr que vous pourrez apaiser les inquiétudes de l'archiduc.${prompt}
  10092: |-
    Se rendre au palais de l'archiduc ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tout de suite.
    Laissez-moi y réfléchir.${prompt}
  10093: Vos actes brilleront sur nous tous !${prompt}
  10094: Voilà l'esprit !${prompt}
  10095: Parlez comme un vrai Windurstien !${prompt}
  10096: De toute façon, vous devez vous présenter à l'archiduc en tant que nouveau membre de la mission diplomatique de San d'Oria. Il est toujours plus sombre avant l'aube, comme on dit.${prompt}
  10097: Ne vous inquiétez pas. Tout le nouveau personnel diplomatique doit se présenter à l'archiduc de toute façon. Il est toujours plus sombre avant l'aube, comme on dit.${prompt}
  10098: Hé, ne vous inquiétez pas ! Tout le nouveau personnel diplomatique doit se présenter à l'archiduc de toute façon. Il est toujours plus sombre avant l'aube, disent les sages.${prompt}
  10099: 'Voici votre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10100: 'Vous avez déjà ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ? Eh bien, je suppose qu’il n’est pas nécessaire d’en émettre un nouveau.${prompt}'
  10101: 'Voici ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10102: 'Vous avez déjà ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ? Eh bien, je suppose que nous n’avons pas besoin de vous en émettre un nouveau, alors.${prompt}'
  10103: 'Voici votre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10104: 'Vous avez déjà ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ? Eh bien, je suppose qu’il n’est pas nécessaire de vous en émettre un nouveau.${prompt}'
  10105: Notre amitié avec les Jeunois repose sur vos épaules. Que la chance soit avec vous !${prompt}
  10106: Notre réputation auprès de Jeuno dépend de vous. Ne nous décevez pas.${prompt}
  10107: Cette mission est cruciale pour notre amitié avec les Jeunois. Que les étoiles veillent sur vous !${prompt}
  10108: Nos prières sont avec vous. Maintenant, hâtez-vous vers le palais de l'archiduc !${prompt}
  10109: Nous croyons en vous, ${name-player}. Maintenant, cherchez audience auprès de l'archiduc !${prompt}
  10110: Allez, et les vents de la fortune vous suivront. Vous ne devez pas faire attendre l'archiduc !${prompt}
  10111: Il est écrit "Zone interdite".${prompt}
  10112: Vous n'avez pas de lettre d'introduction.${prompt}
  10113: Le consulat est absent.${prompt}
  10114: Vous n'avez pas de permis pour voir l'archiduc.${prompt}
  10115: Alors, vous êtes le nouvel attaché.${prompt}
  10116: Je suis Kam'lanaut, Archiduc de Jeuno. J'aimerais l'aide de votre nation pour une certaine affaire.${prompt}
  10117: Oh, un visiteur ?${prompt}
  10118: Bonjour. Je m'appelle Eald'narche. Enchanté.${prompt}
  10119: C'est mon frère. Ne vous laissez pas déranger par lui.${prompt}
  10120: Passons maintenant aux affaires sérieuses. Je vous ai convoqué ici pour une mission spécifique. Avez-vous entendu parler du Seigneur des Ombres ?${prompt}
  10121: Mes sources m'indiquent que les bêtes dans Davoi, Beadeaux et le Château d'Oztroja complotent pour le ramener à Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10122: Ils cherchent à le faire en utilisant le pouvoir de mystérieuses pierres appelées magilithes.${prompt}
  10123: Pour contrer leur plan néfaste, je veux que vous alliez dans ces trois endroits et saisissiez ces magilithes.${prompt}
  10124: 'Bien sûr, j’ai l’intention de vous récompenser pour une tâche de cette envergure. Je délivrerai ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} dès réception des trois magilithes.${prompt}'
  10125: Avec cela, vous pourrez rentrer chez vous rapidement, ou dans n'importe quelle terre civilisée, en fait.${prompt}
  10126: Ils sont après les magilithes, n'est-ce pas ? Je me demande ce que cela signifie... Soyez très prudent. L'idée d'un monde sous le contrôle des bêtes me donne des frissons.${prompt}
  10127: Je parie que les bêtes ont tendu des pièges. D'abord, vous devez recueillir autant d'informations que possible.${prompt}
  10128: Eald'narche dit vrai. Commencez par découvrir ce que vous pouvez en ville. Je compte sur vous !${prompt}
  10129: Un instant, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  10130: Par ordre de Sa Grâce, nous avons décidé de demander l'assistance du Tenshodo, l'organisation dirigée par ce cher Aldo.${prompt}
  10131: Cette mission secrète expose nos souhaits. Seriez-vous assez aimable pour la lui remettre ?${prompt}
  10132: C'est un homme aux multiples talents. Il serait sage de faire sa connaissance. Bonne chance !${prompt}
  10133: Excellent travail. Comment se porte l'archiduc ?${prompt}
  10134: Il veut que vous rassembliez les magilithes ? Je ne sais rien sur les objets de ce genre, mais peut-être devriez-vous en apprendre davantage sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le Château d'Oztroja.${prompt}
  10135: À l'aise, soldat. Alors, comment était l'archiduc ?${prompt}
  10136: Il veut que vous rassembliez les magilithes ? Ce genre de chose dépasse largement mes compétences, donc vous devriez fouiller la terre pour des indices sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le Château d'Oztroja.${prompt}
  10137: Alors, vous avez vu l'archiduc... Eh bien, comment cela s'est-il passé ?${prompt}
  10138: Il veut que vous rassembliez les magilithes ? Je ne peux pas vous offrir de conseils sur ce sujet. Peut-être pouvez-vous essayer d'en apprendre davantage sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le Château d'Oztroja...${prompt}
  10139: Magilithes ! Oui, ces pierres émettent la même puissance que les cristaux. Bien qu'impure, cette puissance est en effet grande.${prompt}
  10140: Maintenant, il est clair pourquoi les bêtes se sont rassemblées là où elles l'ont fait. Elles étaient attirées par la grande puissance des magilithes !${prompt}
  10141: Oui, il est temps d'éradiquer une fois pour toutes la menace des bêtes.${prompt}
  10142: 'Je vous remercie pour votre service. Voici ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. Avec cela, vous pouvez voyager vers n’importe quelle nation qui vous plaît.${prompt}'
  10143: 'Pour l’instant, je vous remercie pour votre service. Puisque vous avez déjà ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, veuillez accepter ceci à la place. Puissiez-vous le dépenser judicieusement.${prompt}'
  10144: Les trois pierres sont incomplètes, mais avec les pouvoirs de la quatrième pierre qui repose au plus profond du Château de Zvahl...${prompt}
  10145: Peut-être alors que le Seigneur des Ombres se lèvera de nouveau.${prompt}
  10146: Bien sûr, le talisman qui scelle les profondeurs intérieures de Zvahl a été mis en place il y a plus de vingt ans. Il empêcherait toute tentative.${prompt}
  10147: J'ai également lu que les trois clés pour ouvrir le sceau étaient conservées en sécurité par les trois grandes nations...${prompt}
  10148: Votre Grâce !${prompt}
  10149: Qu'y a-t-il ?${prompt}
  10150: Des nouvelles tragiques, Votre Grâce ! Les dirigeants des trois nations ont été attaqués !${prompt}
  10151: Attaqués... Par des bêtes ?${prompt}
  10152: Oui, Votre Grâce.${prompt}
  10153: Les confondre ! Ils sont un pas en avance sur nous.${prompt}
  10154: Ainsi, ils cherchent à ressusciter le Seigneur des Ombres... Un objectif assez ambitieux pour des bêtes.${prompt}
  10155: Soit, alors. Peut-être devriez-vous retourner à votre ambassade.${prompt}
  10156: Je ferai à nouveau appel à votre aide bientôt. D'ici là, portez-vous bien.${prompt}
  10157: Hé, que se passe-t-il ? Oh, vous n'avez pas besoin de me le dire.${prompt}
  10158: Oh, donc vous êtes allé au Château d'Oztroja et vous avez rencontré une fille nommée Verena là-bas.${prompt}
  10159: Et elle s'entend bien avec les bêtes. Wow, donc peut-être que nous pourrions nous entendre.${prompt}
  10160: Hé, Wolfgang ! Wolfie, tu es là ?${prompt}
  10161: Que puis-je faire pour vous, Seigneur Eald'narche ?${prompt}
  10162: Pourriez-vous trouver quelqu'un nommé Verena et l'amener ici ? J'ai entendu dire qu'elle est la petite sœur d'Aldo.${prompt}
  10163: Bien sûr, mon seigneur. Mais puis-je demander pourquoi ? Elle semble avoir... des intentions douteuses.${prompt}
  10164: Je pense qu'elle a quelques pouvoirs intéressants, donc je veux juste m'amuser avec elle. C'est tout.${prompt}
  10165: Oh, et ne le dites pas à Kam'lanaut. Je veux lui faire une surprise.${prompt}
  10166: Comme vous le souhaitez, mon seigneur.${prompt}
  10167: Héhé. J'ai hâte !${prompt}
  10168: ${name-player} ! Enfin de retour ! Félicitations pour votre réussite !${prompt}
  10169: Je crains que vous n'ayez pas le temps de vous reposer. Notre bien-aimée San d'Oria est en danger !${prompt}
  10170: Son Excellence est absente, donc veuillez porter ceci à la cour en son nom. Prenez le dirigeable ! Je resterai et ferai ce que je peux.${prompt}
  10171: Dépêchez-vous à San d'Oria ! Vous pouvez embarquer sur le dirigeable maintenant, n'est-ce pas ? Je resterai ici et découvrirai ce que je peux.${prompt}
  10172: Eh bien, je suis soulagé qu'il n'y ait eu aucun danger. Notre ambassade est également en sécurité. Pour l'instant, obéissez aux ordres de la cour.${prompt}
  10173: ${name-player} ! Vous êtes revenu en un seul morceau !${prompt}
  10174: Pas de temps pour le repos, soldat ! Votre pays a besoin de vous !${prompt}
  10175: L'ambassadeur est absent, donc vous devrez porter ceci à l'administration. Prenez le dirigeable ! Je resterai ici pour découvrir ce que je peux.${prompt}
  10176: Montez dans ce dirigeable pour Bastok, soldat ! Je resterai ici et découvrirai ce que je peux.${prompt}
  10177: Ainsi, c'est business as usual à Bastok, hein ? Eh bien, nous n'avons rien de spécial pour vous ici, alors suivez les directives de l'administration.${prompt}
  10178: Vous voilà ! Excellent travail, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  10179: Je suis désolé, mais vous n'avez pas le temps de vous reposer ! Notre bien-aimée Windurst est en grave danger !${prompt}
  10180: Avec l'ambassadeur absent, je veux que vous emportiez ceci dans la mère patrie. Prenez le dirigeable ; c'est plus rapide. Je découvrirai ce que je peux ici.${prompt}
  10181: Dépêchez-vous à Windurst ! Vous pouvez embarquer sur le dirigeable maintenant, n'est-ce pas ? Je découvrirai ce que je peux ici.${prompt}
  10182: Tant que la Star Sibyl est en sécurité, alors tout va bien. Nous n'avons aucune tâche pour vous ici, alors continuez votre service pour votre pays.${prompt}
  10183: 'Vous n’avez pas ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10184: Personne ne voit le souverain sans rendez-vous !${prompt}
  10185: Restez sur place !${prompt}
  10186: 'Juste un moment. Je dois voir votre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  10187: Merci. Si le souverain demande votre audience, l'accès à la chambre sera accordé par les gardes à l'intérieur.${prompt}
  10188: 'Je suis désolé, mais vous aurez besoin de ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} pour entrer.${prompt}'
  10189: C'est la salle des Gardes ducales. Seuls les meilleurs guerriers peuvent rejoindre. En y réfléchissant, ce n'est pas un endroit pour des civils comme vous.${prompt}
  10190: Sir Wolfgang est notre leader. Il a été sélectionné non seulement pour son habileté au combat, mais aussi pour sa détermination inébranlable.${prompt}
  10191: Qui êtes-vous et quel est votre affaire !? Oh, vous êtes un attaché... Mes excuses ! Je dois vérifier chaque personne qui passe par ici.${prompt}
  10192: Dans ce travail, je suppose que tout le monde est coupable jusqu'à preuve du contraire. Je ne voulais offenser personne.${prompt}
  10193: Bienvenue. C'est la demeure de l'archiduc, alors veuillez vous comporter en conséquence.${prompt}
  10194: Les Seigneurs Kam'lanaut et Eald'narche font rarement des apparitions publiques.${prompt}
  10195: Et vous avez besoin d'un permis spécial juste pour avoir une audience avec eux.${prompt}
  10196: Tous deux ont conservé leur jeunesse à travers toutes ces années. Peut-être qu'un pouvoir surnaturel veille sur eux. De grands prophètes comme eux sont en effet rares !${prompt}
  10197: Dites... Vous connaissez Aldo, le gars qui dirige l'organisation appelée le Tenshodo ?${prompt}
  10198: |-
    Le connaissez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10199: Le Tenshodo a été fondé par le père d'Aldo. Ils ont tellement bien réussi dans le commerce à l'étranger qu'ils possèdent le marché noir dans ces environs. Enfin, c'est ce que j'ai entendu...${prompt}
  10200: Aldo a pris la relève après la mort de son père. J'ai entendu toutes sortes de choses à son sujet, mais ils disent que c'est un homme intelligent et honorable.${prompt}
  10201: Oh, vous êtes membre du Tenshodo ? Je suppose que vous en savez plus que moi, alors.${prompt}
  10202: Vous devriez faire des affaires avec le Tenshodo aussi. Ils nous fournissent de temps en temps des produits difficiles à trouver.${prompt}
  10203: Au-delà de nous se dresse le monument de la paix, construit après la guerre. Les ambassades ont été construites autour.${prompt}
  10204: Les seigneurs Kam'lanaut et Eald'narche ont conçu ces jardins de Ru'Lude. Un seul regard suffit pour voir combien ils chérissent la paix.${prompt}
  10205: Ces terrains sont le domaine des seigneurs Kam'lanaut et Eald'narche. Veuillez vous comporter correctement.${prompt}
  10206: Avez-vous déjà rencontré le seigneur Eald'narche ? Il est encore jeune, mais le frère de l'archiduc est doté de talents incroyables.${prompt}
  10207: Jeuno est en sécurité tant qu'elle a l'archiduc Kam'lanaut et le seigneur Eald'narche.${prompt}
  10208: Les trois grandes nations prêchent l'amitié, mais sous la façade se cache une lutte pour la suprématie. Personne ne peut dire ce qui en résultera.${prompt}
  10209: C'est pourquoi nous devons nous concentrer sur nos devoirs. Il n'y a aucune garantie que le règne de paix que nous apprécions maintenant durera.${prompt}
  10210: Saviez-vous que le seigneur Eald'narche porte un cache-œil ? Il a eu un accident quand il était petit, mais cela ne l'a pas découragé ! Bénissez son cœur.${prompt}
  10211: Dans le chaos de la guerre, l'archiduc a eu un plan brillant. Il croyait que la seule chance des trois nations était de mettre de côté leurs querelles et de se tenir ensemble.${prompt}
  10212: Chaque nation devait supporter un fardeau égal dans la lutte contre les bêtes. Sa stratégie était vraiment brillante !${prompt}
  10213: Sans sa guidance, ce monde serait tombé dans l'ombre sous la domination des bêtes.${prompt}
  10214: Dans le passé, il y a eu une terrible guerre. Mon père m'a raconté comment la terre, balayée par des vents furieux, était imprégnée du sang des tombés.${prompt}
  10215: J'ai entendu ses contes à chaque fois qu'il noyait ses chagrins dans l'alcool. Maintenant, ses histoires sont gravées dans ma mémoire.${prompt}
  10216: Le père de Sir Wolfgang était aussi un soldat célèbre. Il commandait les forces de Jeuno lors de la Guerre des Cristaux, et ses exploits sont légendaires.${prompt}
  10217: Après la guerre, il s'est occupé des familles de ses camarades tombés au combat. Quel grand homme... Il y a plus à être soldat que simplement de la force brute !${prompt}
  10218: Parfois, je vois les choses les plus étranges ici. Une fois, l'un de nos débutants a été maudit dans le nécropole d'Eldieme, et je ne savais pas quoi faire.${prompt}
  10219: Je parie qu'il se passe des choses bien trop folles pour nous d'imaginer.${prompt}
  10220: Une fois, j'ai emmené un nouveau gars dans la Nécropole d'Eldieme, et il a été maudit là-bas. Il est devenu fou furieux et avait une envie incontrôlable de viande crue.${prompt}
  10221: Eh bien, j'y ai réfléchi... Et vous savez ces torches dans les pièces en pierre ? Eh bien, j'ai entendu dire que les esprits les détestent...${prompt}
  10222: |-
    Alors, j'ai pensé que cela pourrait aider si j'allumais une lanterne avec ces flammes et l'apportais ici.
    C'est ainsi que nous avons sauvé le gars.${prompt}
  10223: Mais, euh... J'ai aussi entendu dire que certains esprits aiment ce genre de feu. Donc, ça pourrait ne pas toujours être une si bonne idée.${prompt}
  10224: Je suppose que nous avons eu de la chance alors. Nous n'avions aucune idée de quoi d'autre faire, et nous voulions juste faire ce que nous pouvions.${prompt}
  10225: Si vous voulez, nous pouvons vous prêter la lanterne que nous avons utilisée à l'époque. Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?${prompt}
  10226: |-
    Voulez-vous emprunter la lanterne ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, s'il vous plaît.
    Pas maintenant.${prompt}
  10227: Essayez de ramener les flammes dans cette lanterne. Nous ne savons pas ce qui d'autre pourrait aider.${prompt}
  10228: Il me semble qu'il y avait quatre torches, et qu'il fallait les allumer dans le bon ordre.${prompt}
  10229: Oui, c'est vrai. Je me souviens avoir merdé là-dessus. Dommage que j'aie oublié le vrai ordre, cependant. Eh bien, je suis sûr que vous pouvez le comprendre.${prompt}
  10230: N'oubliez pas que c'est la salle en pierre que vous recherchez. Les torches dans les cavernes sont pour autre chose, alors ne les confondez pas.${prompt}
  10231: Oh, oui ? Eh bien, vous pouvez l'utiliser à tout moment.${prompt}

    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  10310: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  10311: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  10312: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  10313: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  10314: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  10315: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  10316: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  10317: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  10318: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  10319: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  10320: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  10321: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  10322: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  10323: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  10324: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  10325: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  10326: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}

    Maintenant, regarde-la... Il n'y a pas une âme à Vana'diel qui ne connaît pas sa beauté.
    Laisse-moi te raconter une histoire...${prompt}
  10488: Il y a longtemps, il y avait un jeune homme--capitaine d'un bateau de pêche--qui menait une vie modeste dans les paisibles ports de Jeuno. Il lui était souvent difficile de joindre les deux bouts, mais lui et ses amis pêcheurs n'avaient aucune plainte. Ils adoraient leur petit village...${prompt}

  10490: Il y avait quelque chose de différent--quelque chose de spécial--chez ces deux-là. Ils possédaient une grande connaissance et un fort leadership, et en peu de temps, ils transformèrent Jeuno d'un point insignifiant sur la carte en une métropole géante.${prompt}
  10491: Au début, le capitaine accueillit ces changements à bras ouverts. Cependant, plus tard, il commença à se demander si tout cela était vraiment pour le bien de Jeuno, ou si la ville n'était qu'un élément d'un plan plus vaste mis en mouvement par les deux hommes mystérieux...${prompt}
  10492: Mais à ce moment-là, il était trop tard... Jeuno et les gens vivant dans ses murs avaient changé... Il n'y avait plus de retour en arrière possible.${prompt}
  10493: 'Et ainsi le capitaine décida : Tant qu’il aurait de la vie dans les os, il ferait de sa mission de rester et de veiller sur sa ville natale.${prompt}'
  10494: Bonjour, Maat.${prompt}
  10495: Oh, si ce n'est pas le Docteur Monberaux.${prompt}

  10510: Autant que je souhaite le voir, il est probable que je ne serai pas là quand la vérité éclatera enfin. Mais de jeunes aventuriers comme toi le seront. C'est pourquoi je veux que tu sois tout ce que tu peux être.${prompt}
  10511: N'oublie pas les difficultés que tu as endurées pour arriver jusqu'ici, et peut-être qu'un jour, toi aussi, tu trouveras quelque chose qui vaut la peine de donner ta vie pour la protéger.${prompt}
  10512: On dit que là où il y a un début, il y a une fin. Cependant, je crois que certaines choses, comme les souvenirs, n'ont pas besoin de finir. C'est là que vous, les jeunes, intervenez...${prompt}

  10546: Twenty years ago, I worked in this very town with scientists from all over the world. We were trying to solve the hunger problem that plagued Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10547: Koru-Moru! Now that's a name that brings back memories.${prompt}
  10548: People say that we scientists are a strange bunch, but Koru-Moru...now he was a crazy one.${prompt}
  10549: But even a weird one like him had a girl he loved. I'll never forget seeing him and Rasusu...${prompt}

  10552: If you promise to keep quiet on the subject, I'll tell you what I know.${prompt}
  10553: Twenty years ago, the Rolanberry Fields were rampaged by those dreadful Crawlers. The problem escalated to the point where the people of Jeuno had nothing to put on their dinner tables.${prompt}
  10554: One adventurer saw the problem that lay before Jeuno and began calling for volunteers to travel to the Crawlers' Nest and exterminate the queen.${prompt}
  10555: Seeing that her research was going nowhere, Rasusu decided to take her chances and go along with the adventurer.${prompt}

  10558: After the war ended, I tried writing Koru-Moru many times, but I could never bring myself to tell him the truth about his beloved Rasusu.${prompt}

    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  10582: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  10583: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  10584: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  10585: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  10586: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  10587: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  10588: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  10589: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  10590: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  10591: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.

  10598: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  10599: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  10600: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10601: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  10602: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  10603: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  10604: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  10605: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  10606: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  10607: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  10608: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  10609: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  10610: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}

  10707: Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt}
  10708: You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt}
  10709: Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt}
  10710: Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt}
  10711: Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt}
  10712: Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt}
  10713: Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt}

    Our little friend came all the way from Windurst to greet us. Let us hear what he has to say.${prompt}
  11007: Kahk-ka-ka! You came all this way to ask about the Full Moon Fountain?${prompt}
  11008: Well, you Tartutaru have probably already realized why the Horutoto Ruins were built and why the Full Moon Fountain exists underneath them.${prompt}
  11009: Those ruins are evil.${prompt}
  11010: The towers sponge dry the areas around Sarutabaruta of all their magic.${prompt}
  11011: You think that we Yagudo are the cause of these wastelands, but you only have yourselves to thank. You--the Tarutaru that activated those towers!${prompt}
  11012: The towers are all damaged! How do you explain magic still being drained from the plains of Sarutabaruta?${prompt}
  11013: What about you Yagudo? What are those things that you continue digging? Those stones...maybe they are the cause of all this?${prompt}
  11014: Kahk-ka-ka...I commend you on your perceptiveness.${prompt}
  11015: But the reason Sarutabaruta is becoming a wasteland has nothing to do with those stones.${prompt}
  11016: That night, twenty years ago, when we were defeated by your armies, you made a grave mistake...${prompt}
  11017: Kahk! Kahk! You still do not understand?${prompt}
  11018: Make your way deep into the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins. There you will see first hand what the Star Sibyl and those summoners really did.${prompt}
  11019: The moon and the stars no longer smile upon Windurst. Now, the world shall kneel before the Yagudo!${prompt}
  11020: The bushin's so old that he's losing his eyesight!?${prompt}
  11021: |-
    <Sigh>
    Well, it has been thirty years. Just look at me. I'm not as young as I used to be.${prompt}

    What's this? You want to know what would impress the bushin? Hmmm...
    Well, when I was still his disciple, I once presented him with ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}.${prompt}
  11024: |-
    He was so pleased that he didn't just let me see the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, he let me try it on!
    I could feel the weight of the souls of all the bushin that had worn it before me.${prompt}
  11025: But that weight was too great for me, and ever since that day, I've been striving to improve my skills.${prompt}
  11026: But even now I don't think I could even grasp that belt with my own hands, let alone tie it around my waist. I still have much to learn...${prompt}

    Now, I can't let such a great hero go home empty-handed.

    Come on, then. No need to be shy.
    What's it to be?${prompt}

    ...!
    Take off my hat!?

    No? You've made up your mind, it seems.

  11042: Même le plus puissant des chênes se flétrira avec le temps. Ses feuilles vibrantes deviendront marron et se désintégreront en poussière. Moi aussi, je devrai un jour quitter ce jardin pour de bon.${prompt}
  11043: Comprends-tu ce que j'essaie de dire ?${prompt}
  11044: |-
    Quand ce jour viendra, je veux que tu prennes ce chapeau et que tu deviennes le puissant chêne. Veille sur les jeunes pousses tandis qu'elles se dressent vers le ciel.
    Je sais que tu en es capable, ${name-player}.${prompt}

  11051: Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas garantir que vous recevrez une réponse rapide.${prompt}
  11052: Il y a un homme de la Guilde des Alchimistes qui attend de parler aux scientifiques depuis plusieurs jours.${prompt}
  11053: Je crois qu'il attend encore quelque part près des quartiers de l'archiduc. Pauvre âme...${prompt}
  11054: As-tu entendu ? Certains des cristaux de téléportation à Holla, Mea et Dem se sont brisés en un million de morceaux !${prompt}
  11055: Voilà pourquoi le capitaine Wolfgang est sur les nerfs ces derniers temps... Mais que se passe-t-il vraiment dans ces crêtes ?${prompt}
  11056: Je vois que tu commences à montrer de l'intérêt pour les étranges événements qui se sont produits ces dernières semaines.${prompt}
  11057: |-
    Laisse-moi te raconter un peu ce que j'ai entendu...
    Récemment, le Duché a été en effervescence avec des histoires étranges de voyageurs attirés dans des tourbillons étranges situés dans les dunes de Valkurm et sur l'île de Qufim... et ne revenant jamais.${prompt}
  11058: D'après ce que j'ai compris, les scientifiques ducal pensent que ce phénomène a quelque chose à voir avec les téléporteurs brisés aux crêtes de Holla, Dem et Mea.${prompt}
  11059: Pour collecter des données, un groupe de Gardes Ducaux sera envoyé d'un jour à l'autre.${prompt}
  11060: |-
    Des tourbillons étranges à Valkurm et Qufim...
    Des téléporteurs brisés...
    Que cela peut-il bien signifier ?${prompt}
  11061: Le rapport d'enquête rédigé par les Gardes Ducaux mentionne que les tourbillons à Valkurm et Qufim sont constitués d'une substance inconnue qu'ils appellent “le Vide”.${prompt}
  11062: |-
    Et maintenant, il y a des rumeurs disant qu'en sautant dans ces vortex sombres, les gens peuvent se téléporter instantanément vers l'île perdue de Tavnazia !
    Moi, je reste ici où c'est sûr !${prompt}
  11063: J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles une lumière vive a jailli de la mer quelque part au nord de la tour de Delkfutt.${prompt}
  11064: Une équipe d'enquête est prévue pour rechercher des indices dans la zone, mais ils auront du pain sur la planche. Les courants dans la mer de Shu'Meyo sont imprévisibles et violents. Beaucoup de capitaines ont perdu leur navire dans ces eaux.${prompt}
  11065: Saviez-vous qu’il y a un groupe mystérieux d’officiels à Jeuno connu sous le nom de la “Société Armathrwn” ?${prompt}
  11066: La dernière fois que j'ai essayé de parler de ce groupe à certaines des nouvelles recrues, le capitaine Wolfgang m'a mis de corvée de latrines pendant neuf semaines et demie !${prompt}
  11067: Vous, un aventurier négligé, avez parlé avec Sir Nag'molada !?${prompt}
  11068: Saviez-vous qu'il était un membre de haut rang de la prestigieuse Société Armathrwn, les conseillers de l'archiduc Kam'lanaut ?${prompt}
  11069: Sir Nag'molada parle souvent avec les gens ordinaires du Duché. J'ai même entendu dire que des promotions sont accordées à ceux qui parviennent à l'impressionner.${prompt}
  11070: Je me demande s'il prendra un jour le temps de me parler... Que dirais-je ?${prompt}
  11071: Vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Alors vous avez probablement déjà entendu parler du dragon gigantesque qui a survolé les cieux de l'ouest.${prompt}
  11072: Au début, tout le monde pensait qu'il pourrait s'agir d'un wyverne égaré, mais il y a des rumeurs disant que c'était en fait l'un de ces anciens “wyrms” !${prompt}
  11073: Vous voulez en savoir plus sur les officiels en robes noires qui apparaissent parfois dans la cour ?${prompt}  
  11074: Ils sont tous membres de la Société Armathrwn, des scientifiques travaillant pour le Duché. J'ai entendu dire qu'il y a même pas mal de femmes parmi eux.${prompt}
  11075: Alors que l'Armada de Jeuno se prépare à la bataille, il reste du devoir des Gardes Ducaux de veiller à la sécurité des citoyens de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11076: As-tu entendu dire qu'une arme super-secrète était en train d'être chargée sur l'un des navires de guerre ? Je me demande ce que ça peut être...${prompt}
  11077: Oui, j'ai entendu certains des autres gardes mentionner que les scientifiques de la société avaient construit une nouvelle machine de guerre terrifiante.${prompt}
  11078: D'accord ! Après avoir utilisé cette machine, ainsi que les canons ultra-puissants des dirigeables, il ne restera plus assez de ces wyrms pour même faire des hamburgers de dragon !${prompt}
  11079: L'Armada de Jeuno se prépare à une attaque contre le Roi Wyrm, Bahamut. Cependant, il n'y a rien à craindre. Nos forces sont les plus fortes et les plus avancées de tout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11080: As-tu vu un garçon ou une fille étrange courir dans les jardins ?${prompt}
  11081: Si c'est le cas, informe un des Gardes Ducaux. Il y a actuellement des mandats d'arrestation pour les deux.${prompt}
  11082: |-
    Leur capture est cruciale pour la sécurité non seulement de Jeuno, mais de tout Vana'diel.
    L'aide que vous et vos compagnons aventuriers pouvez apporter dans cette affaire est grandement appréciée.${prompt}
  11083: |-
    Des membres de la Société Armathrwn doivent accompagner l'armada dans sa mission.
    On dit que les avancées technologiques de la société sont ce qui a construit cette ville et en a fait ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11084: Lady Esha'ntarl est censée diriger la mission contre Bahamut. Avec une commandante aussi compétente à la tête de l'armada, il n'y a rien dans Vana'diel qui puisse arrêter le Duché !${prompt}
  11085: Je sais que tu considères peut-être ta nation comme une force puissante dans Vana'diel, mais Jeuno est la seule nation avec les ressources nécessaires pour vaincre le Roi Wyrm. Ne l'oublie pas.${prompt}
  11086: |-
    L'un des navires de guerre de l'armada a disparu !
    Avec toute la sécurité renforcée, comment quelqu'un a-t-il pu réussir un exploit aussi grand que de voler un dirigeable ?${prompt}
  11087: Alors que l'Armada de Jeuno mène sa mission dans les cieux, il reste du devoir des Gardes Ducaux de veiller à la sécurité des citoyens de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11088: As-tu découvert quelque chose de plus sur l'arme super-secrète que l'armada a emportée avec elle ?${prompt}
  11089: 'Non... Cependant, j’ai entendu dire que l’appareil a porté un coup sévère au puissant Roi Wyrm lors de l’assaut.${prompt}'
  11090: Wowzie ! Si j'avais un appareil ultra-sophistiqué comme ça, je mangerais des burgers de dragon rôti tous les soirs !${prompt}
  11091: Les derniers rapports indiquent que la mission récente de l'armada a été un succès. Cependant, cela n'a pas complètement arrêté le Roi Wyrm et ses sbires. Il est rumeur que la flotte lancera sa deuxième attaque une fois les réparations actuelles des navires de guerre terminées.${prompt}
  11092: Si vous avez des informations sur la localisation de la fille que le Duché recherchait, je suis désolé, mais le mandat d'arrestation a été annulé.${prompt}
  11093: La Garde Ducale a récemment reçu la nouvelle de sa mort...${prompt}
  11094: Même avec la technologie de la Société Armathrwn de notre côté, l'armada n'a pas pu complètement vaincre le Roi Wyrm et son armée. Peut-être avons-nous sous-estimé leur pouvoir...${prompt}
  11095: Lors de sa première vague d'attaques, l'armada a réussi à infliger beaucoup de dégâts à Bahamut. Le Roi Wyrm ne tiendra pas face à la deuxième vague.${prompt}
  11096: |-
    <Soupir>
    J'ai demandé un transfert de la Garde Ducale à l'équipage de l'armada, mais j'ai été refusé...${prompt}
  11097: |-
    Pourquoi dois-je rester dans les jardins alors que tout le monde s'amuse ? Regarde ces biceps ! Je pourrais éliminer un wyrm d'un seul coup !
    Eh bien... peut-être deux coups.${prompt}
  11098: Nous commencions à nous demander quand tu arriverais, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11099: Le duc vicaire rencontre actuellement un messager de l'Est. Quand elle aura terminé, ce sera ton tour. D'ici là, tu seras gardé en détention.${prompt}
  11100: Je m'excuse pour l'absence du Grand Duc Kam'lanaut. Moi, Esha'ntarl, je servirai en son lieu.${prompt}
  11101: J'ai entendu dire que tu venais de l'Empire de l'Est pour demander quelque chose à notre nation. Déclare ton nom et ta requête.${prompt}
  11102: '...Je suis Tenzen. Né et élevé dans l’Extrême-Orient, je sers comme samouraï sous la puissante dynastie.${prompt}'
  11103: Dame Esha'ntarl, puis-je demander pourquoi mon audience n'a pas été accordée par le duc lui-même ?${prompt}
  11104: '${choice: 1}[Depuis la résurrection du Seigneur des Ombres/Même après la défaite du Seigneur des Ombres], le grand duc a été submergé par ses devoirs envers le peuple de cette terre.${prompt}'
  11105: Cependant, tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter. Je prendrai la responsabilité de transmettre directement tes paroles à Lord Kam'lanaut.${prompt}
  11106: Ces deux-ci en seront témoins.${prompt}
  11107: '...${prompt}'
  11108: Bien que mon message soit court, il n'est pas simple. Il est crucial que le duc comprenne pleinement la gravité de la situation qui se présente devant nous.${prompt}
  11109: Ce que je suis sur le point de dire ne concerne pas seulement ma patrie, mais aussi les pays du sud et de l'ouest, ainsi que cette belle terre.${prompt}
  11110: |-
    Le Vide se rapproche.
    Il est déjà apparu aux confins de l'Empire de l'Est. Je peux supposer qu'il en est de même pour les régions périphériques des terres du sud et de l'ouest.${prompt}
  11111: Le phénomène a commencé petit, mais ces derniers mois, il a commencé à croître. Comme la sève qui s'écoule lentement d'un arbre, le Vide se répand à travers mon pays, engloutissant entièrement les collines et les forêts.${prompt}
  11112: |-
    À son approche, les enfants commencent à rêver.
    Quand il arrive, il ne faut pas longtemps avant que les adultes aussi commencent à rêver.${prompt}
  11113: |-
    Le rêve est toujours le même...
    Il nous dit...que le Gardien de l'Apocalypse apparaîtra bientôt, et apportera avec lui la fin de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11114: |-
    Le Gardien de l'Apocalypse...
    Un nom effrayant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11115: Votre rapport sur cette “obscurité”--cet Vide--n'est pas une nouvelle pour nous. Ces dernières semaines, il y a eu des rapports de phénomènes similaires se produisant dans les régions autour de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11116: Cependant, ces rapports indiquent que le Vide, comme vous l'appelez, est localisé. C'est pourquoi nous avons choisi de retenir cette information du public jusqu'à ce qu'elle puisse être davantage recherchée. Si c'est vrai que le Vide a commencé à se répandre, cependant, une enquête immédiate peut être nécessaire.${prompt}
  11117: Le Duché doit-il préparer une équipe ?${prompt}
  11118: |-
    ...
    Vous...ne savez pas pourquoi le Vide est apparu ?${prompt}
  11119: Malheureusement, nos scientifiques n'ont pas encore tiré de conclusions concrètes. Si votre empire a des données définitives, nous serions ravis de les entendre.${prompt}
  11120: Suggérez-vous que la cause du Vide puisse être trouvée dans mon pays ? Ne me dites pas que vous ignorez que les cinq éclats de la légende reposent ici !${prompt}
  11121: Ne me dites pas que vous ignorez que c'est le pouvoir des cinq éclats qui protège Vana'diel du Vide !${prompt}
  11122: |-
    Tenzen de l'Est...
    Vous êtes très direct dans vos accusations.${prompt}
  11123: |-
    Voyons voir...
    Vous pensez que Jeuno est la cause de la croissance du Vide.
    Vous pensez que nos tentatives de maîtriser le pouvoir des cristaux ont entraîné la propagation de l'obscurité, ai-je raison ?${prompt}
  11124: Eh bien, je suis désolé de dire que vous êtes tout à fait dans l'erreur. Jeuno est pleinement conscient du pouvoir que les cristaux rayonnent.${prompt}
  11125: Les cinq éclats--les cristaux-mères--sont ce qui soutient notre monde.${prompt}
  11126: Nous, le Duché, nous sommes chargés d'hériter de la volonté des anciens et de protéger les ruines Zilartiennes et les cristaux qu'elles contiennent.${prompt}
  11127: Nous avons gardé cette information des nations de Bastok, Windurst et San d'Oria pour protéger les cristaux-mères de ceux qui pourraient vouloir utiliser leur pouvoir à des fins personnelles.${prompt}
  11128: Je vois que l'Empire de l'Est a appris l'existence des cristaux, et donc nous ne pouvons plus vous faire confiance non plus.${prompt}
  11129: Jeuno ne peut permettre que le pouvoir des cristaux-mères tombe entre les mains de ceux qui pourraient l'exploiter.${prompt}
  11130: Le seul souhait de mon pays est de prévenir que le Vide n'emporte plus que ce qu'il a déjà pris !${prompt}
  11131: Voir, de vos propres yeux, l'obscurité drainer la vie de votre patrie... Je peux comprendre pourquoi vous pouvez ne pas être d'accord avec la position de notre nation.${prompt}
  11132: |-
    Très bien. Je peux vous dire une chose.
    Le Duché est actuellement à la recherche d'un garçon. On pense que ce garçon est lié d'une certaine manière au Vide.${prompt}
  11133: Bien qu'il ne soit pas l'un des nôtres, il a déjà trouvé un moyen d'entrer dans trois des ruines Zilartiennes, le Vide suivant son chemin.${prompt}
  11134: Nous pensons ici que ce garçon est le Gardien de l'Apocalypse dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  11135: |-
    A boy?
    Could he be a messenger from another nation?${prompt}
  11136: |-
    That we do not know.
    However...${prompt}
  11137: |-
    Wolfgang.
    Show the adventurer in.${prompt}
  11138: |-
    This adventurer was with the boy when he appeared near the mothercrystals.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] hails from the nation of ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].${prompt}
  11139: |-
    ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/The Republic/The Federation]!
    What could ${choice: 0}[the king/the president/those mages] be conspiring!?${prompt}
  11140: 'Of course, ${choice: 0}[the Kingdom/Bastok/Windurst] has denied all ties to the boy.${prompt}'
  11141: As has this adventurer.${prompt}
  11142: 'However, if we learn that ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/the Republic/the Federation] is behind this threat to the mothercrystals and the well-being of all those residing on Vana''diel...${prompt}'
  11143: Whether allies or not, Jeuno will be forced to take action against the nation. We will destroy them.${prompt}
  11144: But this is still nothing more than speculation. If we had the time to conduct a proper investigation, it would be the first thing we did. Unfortunately, time is one luxury we do not have.${prompt}
  11145: And that is why we must capture the boy immediately to learn of what he knows...${prompt}
  11146: |-
    Exactly.
    And that is why I offer you a chance--a chance to prove your country's true intents by joining this battle to save your nation--no, all of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11147: |-
    Adventurer.
    Travel to the fourth crystal and wait for the boy. When he arrives, capture him and bring him here.${prompt}
  11148: Unlike the first three crystals, the fourth lies deep beneath Vana'diel's surface, somewhere below the glaciers of the Northlands.${prompt}
  11149: Thirty years ago, an allied expedition visited the Northlands. If you could find one of the original members, you may be able to obtain some valuable information.${prompt}
  11150: |-
    Francmage M Mistalle, of the Knights Mistalle in San d'Oria...
    Iru-Kuiru, from the Rhinostery in Windurst...
    Mythril Musketeer captain, Ulrich, from Bastok...${prompt}
  11151: I have heard news that the criminal accused of destroying the Telepoints was captured and taken into custody.${prompt}
  11152: However, when questioned, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] said she had nothing to do with the incidents. To prove ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] innocence, the Duchy has ordered the scoundrel to travel to the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria and gather information that will clear ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name.${prompt}
  11153: What is this? You say you have business with the captain?${prompt}
  11154: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    I was looking for you.${prompt}
  11155: Esha'ntarl, duke vicarious, would like to hear your account of what transpired in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11156: |-
    ...?
    What is this envelope?${prompt}
  11157: |-
    From Doctor Monberaux?
    Why would he...?${prompt}
  11158: |-
    However, first things first.
    Follow me.${prompt}
  11159: Ah, welcome back, adventurer.${prompt}
  11160: I see that you were unsuccessful in protecting the fourth crystal.${prompt}
  11161: And now it is looking more and more like you are the one who is leading the boy...${prompt}
  11162: Relax, adventurer. I am not blaming you for anything.${prompt}
  11163: Nag'molada kept the secret of the amulet to himself.${prompt}
  11164: It is his foolishness that acted as a catalyst for what occurred in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11165: And now that we know the true identity of the boy, there is no reason to further suspect your nation's involvement. I apologize for not trusting you.${prompt}
  11166: However, now we must put aside our misunderstandings and unite to save our world from being destroyed. Will you help us protect the mothercrystals?${prompt}
  11167: |-
    Join forces with Jeuno?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11168: We have caused you much suffering, and I understand your anger. On behalf of the Duchy I ask for your forgiveness.${prompt}
  11169: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  11170: In the presence of the fourth crystal, I have learned that a strange occurrence took place.${prompt}
  11171: Is it true that the girl you took with you actually helped Selh'teus and thwarted the plans of our Nag'molada?${prompt}
  11172: It is extremely important that you do not withhold information from us.${prompt}
  11173: |-
    Is it true?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11174: |-
    I see...
    The Duchy is currently searching for that girl.${prompt}
  11175: We do not wish to punish her. We feel that she may be in grave danger. We must find her so we can protect her.${prompt}
  11176: The first threat to her will be Nag'molada. He is already attempting to make it seem as if the fall of the fourth crystal was the girl's fault.${prompt}
  11177: If he finds her, he will more than likely poison her mind, preventing her from speaking of anything that may harm his plan.${prompt}
  11178: The second threat will be the boy, Selh'teus. His next destination will most surely be the fifth and final crystal.${prompt}
  11179: However, this crystal lies deep beneath the sea, and the only one who knows how to reach it is the girl.${prompt}
  11180: Finally, the third threat will consist of assassins from the south.${prompt}
  11181: You may have already heard the rumors of the Mithran sin hunters who have crossed the southern seas to try the theologians of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11182: These hunters will not give up until they have punished all those they seek.${prompt}
  11183: And that is why we need your help, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11184: If you find the girl, bring her here. No harm will be brought to her. I swear on the name of the Goddess.${prompt}
  11185: Lady Esha'ntarl!${prompt}
  11186: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Did you tell them everything that happened in the Northlands?${prompt}
  11187: My plan was flawless! If it wasn't for that despicable girl, Prishe, I would have captured Selh'teus, and this whole ordeal would be solved!${prompt}
  11188: That girl heard the whisper of Selh'teus's soul, sang the “Memoria de la S^tona,” and helped him escape!${prompt}
  11189: The “testament of affinity” she possesses--it connects the hearts and souls of men. Selh'teus has been using that to control her!${prompt}
  11190: '...${prompt}'
  11191: But now we have the chance to find out his true intentions.${prompt}
  11192: If we can capture the girl, we can use her to tap into Selh'teus's mind. We can learn if he truly arrived to save Al'Taieu!${prompt}
  11193: |-
    You miserable man!
    Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that our crusade ended long ago?${prompt}
  11194: |-
    You fool!
    Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that the celestial capital was destroyed long ago?${prompt}
  11195: Perhaps it is we who do not know the true outcome of the crusade or the true fate of our capital!${prompt}
  11196: I propose that an expedition be sent to Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  11197: There we may find the answers to why Selh'teus survived all the centuries, and why he continues to poison the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  11198: And that is why we must first investigate the line leading to the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  11199: Please, grant me access to the Crystal Terminal!${prompt}
  11200: |-
    ...
    I understand why you feel an expedition to Al'Taieu is necessary.${prompt}

  11215: |-
    We can draw him forth without traveling to the fifth crystal.
    We can seal him without your precious Eye of Altana.${prompt}

  11217: You can hear me, can you not...Selh'teus?${prompt}
  11218: It is I who possess the other amulet you seek.${prompt}
  11219: |-
    I am waiting, Selh'teus!
    Come and fulfill the pact!${prompt}
  11220: Here, take this envelope back to the doctor. It does not belong to me.${prompt}
  11221: But why would he try to...?${prompt}
  11222: Not but a few moments ago, Sir Nag'molada passed by this station. However, he did not seem himself. I wonder if something is wrong...${prompt}

    ${name-player}...
    Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.
    The time left to me is short.
  11246: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt}
  11247: |-
    I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...
    It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt}
  11248: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt}
  11249: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt}
  11250: |-
    My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.
    Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt}
  11251: |-
    Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.
    You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.

  11255: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt}
  11256: |-
    I see you have met with Raogrimm.
    His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt}
  11257: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt}
  11258: 'You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana''diel and that other world.${prompt}'
  11259: 'It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is one of those items.${prompt}'

  11261: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt}
  11262: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  11263: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt}
  11264: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt}
  11265: 'Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to guide you...${prompt}'

  11269: Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...${prompt}
  11270: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  11271: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  11272: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  11273: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  11274: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  11275: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  11276: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}
  11277: |-
    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.

  11279: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt}
  11280: I have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  11281: |-
    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  11282: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  11283: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  11284: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  11285: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  11286: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  11287: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  11288: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  11289: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  11290: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  11291: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11292: |-
    I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt}
  11293: |-
    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  11294: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  11295: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  11296: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  11297: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  11298: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11299: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  11300: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  11301: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  11302: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  11303: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  11304: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  11305: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  11306: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  11307: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  11308: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  11309: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  11310: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  11311: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  11312: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  11313: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  11314: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11315: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  11316: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  11317: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  11318: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  11319: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  11320: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  11321: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11322: Is it over...?${prompt}
  11323: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  11324: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  11325: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  11326: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  11327: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  11328: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  11329: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  11330: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  11331: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  11332: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  11333: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  11334: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  11335: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  11336: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  11337: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  11338: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11339: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  11340: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  11341: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  11342: My old companions...?
  11343: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  11344: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  11345: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  11346: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  11347: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  11348: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  11349: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  11350: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  11351: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  11352: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  11353: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}
  11354: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  11355: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  11356: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  11357: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.
    As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt}
  11358: |-
    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}
  11359: |-
    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}
  11360: |-
    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...
    No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt}

  11650: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  11651: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  11652: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  11653: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  11654: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  11655: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  11656: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  11657: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  11658: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  11659: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  11660: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  11661: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  11662: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  11663: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  11664: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  11665: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  11666: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  11667: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  11668: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  11669: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  11670: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  11671: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'

  11674: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  11675: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  11676: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

  12023: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  12024: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  12025: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12026: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  12027: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  12028: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  12029: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  12030: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  12031: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  12032: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  12033: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12034: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  12035: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  12036: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12037: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  12038: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  12039: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  12040: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  12041: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  12042: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  12043: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  12044: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  12045: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  12046: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  12047: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  12048: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  12049: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  12050: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  12051: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  12052: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  12054: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  12055: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  12056: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  12057: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  12058: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  12059: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  12060: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  12061: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'
  12062: |-
    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  12063: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  12064: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  12065: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  12066: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'
  12067: |-
    In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:
    Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt}
  12068: |-
    Level 40 matches: 31～40
    Level 50 matches: 41～50
    Level 60 matches: 51～60
    Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt}
  12069: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt}
  12070: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt}
  12071: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt}

  12073: Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.${prompt}
  12074: Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.${prompt}
  12075: After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.${prompt}
  12076: 'If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special ${color: 5}chevron${color: 1} as well as a new ${color: 5}title${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12077: There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.${prompt}
  12078: Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12079: Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.${prompt}
  12080: However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.${prompt}
  12081: 'Finally, ${color: 5}checking${color: 1} someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.${prompt}'

  12134: ${name-npc} te lance un étrange sort...${prompt}
  12135: |-
    Hmmm... Ça n'a pas fonctionné, kupo...
    Je suppose que j'ai encore des recherches à faire. Nous devrons mettre l'expérience en attente pendant un moment, kupo.${prompt}
  12136: |-
    Hein ? À quoi sert un aventurier qui n'est pas prêt à se lancer dans un petit périple ?
    Eh bien, reviens vers moi si jamais tu changes d'avis, kupo...${prompt}
  12137: |-
    Tu as travaillé dur, ou tu es à peine en train de travailler, kupo ?
    N'oublie pas qu'en appuyant sur le bouton “Points de Mérite” dans le menu “Statut”, tu peux vérifier le total des points de mérite, changer les modes d'accumulation d'expérience et ajuster les compétences et les attributs.${prompt}
  12138: |-
    Hoho, kupo ! Ou peut-être cherches-tu à transcender tes limites ?
    Parce que ça pourrait aussi être arrangé...${prompt}
  12139: |-
    Demander à propos des points de mérite ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  12140: |-
    Que veux-tu demander ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dépasser tes limites.
    Points de mérite.
    Rien.${prompt}
  12141: Eh bien, si jamais vous avez besoin d'un rappel, vous savez où me trouver, kupo !${prompt}
  12142: Ou peut-être avez-vous enfin rassemblé le courage de conquérir vos limites intérieures, kupo ?${prompt}
  12143: |-
    Avant de vous précipiter dans quoi que ce soit, laissez-moi vous informer de la disclaim... euh, des détails de la méthode, kupo.
    Vous êtes-vous déjà demandé ce qui arrive à toute l'expérience que vous accumulez après avoir atteint le niveau maximal ?${prompt}
  12144: 'Au cours des derniers mois, j’ai découvert que ce type d’expérience se forme dans votre corps sous une forme complètement différente - une sorte de super expérience, si vous voulez. J’ai donné à ce phénomène le nom de ${color: 5}points de limite${color: 1}, kupo !${prompt}'
  12145: Lorsque vous accumulez dix mille de ces points, ils se transforment magiquement en un type d'expérience encore plus super - une expérience super-duper, si vous voulez. J'appelle ces points ultra-spéciaux “points de mérite,” kupo !${prompt}
  12146: Mais ce n'est pas tout ce que j'ai découvert. Je pense également avoir découvert une méthode pour gérer ces points et les utiliser pour augmenter les niveaux de votre corps et de votre esprit au-delà de leurs limites actuelles ! Je l'appelle “Gestion de mérite moogle,” kupo !${prompt}
  12147: |-
    Je peux dire par l'expression sur votre visage que vous êtes plutôt intéressé, kupo.
    Alors, qu'aimeriez-vous savoir ?${prompt}
  12148: |-
    Demander à propos de...
    ${selection-lines}
    Comment accumuler des points de mérite.
    Comment ajuster les attributs.
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  12149: Eh bien, vous savez déjà qu'en atteignant le niveau 75, vous êtes prêt à commencer à collecter des points de limite, n'est-ce pas, kupo ?${prompt}
  12150: Eh bien, avant de commencer, n'oubliez pas que vous devez appuyer sur le bouton “Points de Mérite” dans le menu “Statut”.${prompt}
  12151: Il n'apparaît que lorsque votre niveau principal est de 75 ou plus, kupo.${prompt}
  12152: En appuyant sur ce bouton, vous pouvez basculer entre le “mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience” et le “mode d'accumulation de points de limite”, kupo.${prompt}
  12153: En mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience, vous gagnerez des EXP normales après chaque bataille jusqu'à ce que vous atteigniez le maximum...${prompt}
  12154: '... tandis qu’en mode d’accumulation de points de limite, vous recevrez des points de limite après chaque bataille. C’est aussi simple que ça, kupo !${prompt}'
  12155: Oh, et au fait - si vous êtes toujours en mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience après avoir atteint votre montant maximum d'EXP, toutes les batailles combattues à partir de ce moment-là vous rapporteront des points de limite, quel que soit le mode dans lequel vous vous trouvez, kupo !${prompt}
  12156: Normalement, vous ne pouvez accumuler des points de limite que lorsque vous jouez un job qui a atteint le niveau 75 ou plus. Cependant, il y a une exception, kupo !${prompt}
  12157: Lorsqu'un job capable de recevoir des points de limite a été réduit par une restriction de niveau, vous pouvez toujours gagner des points de limite en battant des ennemis !${prompt}
  12158: N'oubliez simplement pas de changer de mode avant de partir en chasse ! Lorsque vous êtes en mode d'accumulation de points de limite, la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre “Statut” changera légèrement pour vous le signaler, kupo !${prompt}
  12159: Enfin, si vous rétrogradez de niveau ou changez de jobs tout en étant en mode d'accumulation de points de limite, vous passerez automatiquement en mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience.${prompt}
  12160: 'Ah, et un dernier conseil : Vous pouvez toujours vérifier le montant des points de limite et des points de mérite que vous avez gagnés en consultant le menu “Points de Mérite”.${prompt}'
  12161: Ummm, tout d'abord, vous pouvez vérifier le nombre de points de mérite que vous avez accumulés en appuyant sur le bouton “Points de Mérite” dans le menu “Statut” dans le menu principal.${prompt}
  12162: Les données que j'ai recueillies jusqu'à présent me disent qu'il est assez difficile d'augmenter ces attributs, et qu'il semble y avoir une limite à la quantité d'un certain attribut qui peut être augmentée, kupo.${prompt}
  12163: Il semble également que certains attributs et compétences soient connectés de quelque manière. J'appelle ces groupes “catégories”.${prompt}
  12164: 'Par exemple, imaginez que les attributs de la catégorie “PV/PM” peuvent être augmentés ${color: 5}“en combinaison”${color: 1} sept fois, kupo.${prompt}'
  12165: Cela signifie que si vous augmentez vos “PV max” cinq fois, vous ne pouvez augmenter vos “PM max” que deux fois.${prompt}
  12166: En d'autres termes, vous ne pouvez pas augmenter tous les attributs à leurs limites. Le corps doit maintenir un certain équilibre, sinon il explosera ! Ou quelque chose comme ça, kupo.${prompt}
  12167: Il y a aussi un moyen de baisser les attributs qui ont été poussés au-delà de leurs limites. Malheureusement, chaque fois que cela est tenté, les points de mérite utilisés pour augmenter initialement cet attribut sont perdus, kupo...${prompt}
  12168: Oh, et enfin, il y a certains attributs et compétences dans la même catégorie qui ont des limites différentes. Je ne suis toujours pas sûr de tout cela, alors je vous suggère de demander des conseils à certains de vos camarades de niveau 75, kupo !${prompt}
  12169: |-
    Hrm?
    Hmmm...
    J'ai besoin d'un peu de temps seul pour réfléchir...
    Pourrais-tu revenir un peu plus tard, kupo ?${prompt}

    Je m'en doutais, kupo !
    Alors, Maat ? Qu'en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  12172: Nous sommes sur le point de basculer dans une nouvelle ère. C'est le devoir donné par la Déesse à un vieux guerrier comme moi de préparer la jeune génération à suivre mes pas. Et qui de mieux qu'un jeune ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] qui a relevé tous les défis envoyés ${choice-player-gender}[à lui/à elle] ?${prompt}
  12173: Tu peux le dire, mon ami !${prompt}
  12174: Tu as sans doute entendu parler des tablettes mog--ces dalles de pierre gravées de la sagesse intemporelle du Grand Roi Kupofried qui apparaissent périodiquement à travers le pays.${prompt}
  12175: |-
    Les tablettes renferment de nombreux secrets que nous, les mogs, n'avons pas encore dévoilés, kupo.
    Pourquoi nos ailes sont-elles violettes ? Pourquoi nos nez sont-ils rouges ? Comment pouvons-nous mieux aider nos amis aventuriers ?${prompt}
  12176: J'étais justement en train de discuter avec un ami du Magian Mooglehood sur ce sujet... C'est là que l'idée m'a frappé comme un troupeau d'hecteyes !${prompt}
  12177: Et si les anciens arts mogs pouvaient être utilisés non seulement pour augmenter les possessions des aventuriers, mais aussi les aventuriers eux-mêmes, kupo !?${prompt}
  12178: |-
    En utilisant mes connaissances en points de mérite--et en m'appuyant sur la maîtrise martiale de Maat ici présent--j'ai élaboré une méthode qui pourrait bien fonctionner !
    Qu'en dis-tu, aventurier ? Veux-tu être mon cobaye ?${prompt}
  12179: |-
    Bien sûr, personne ne te blâmerait de ne pas faire confiance à ce petit diable.
    Je ne suis même pas sûr de le faire. Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  12180: |-
    Un aventurier qui refuserait une force plus grande est-il vraiment un aventurier ?
    Allez, maintenant ! Qu'as-tu à perdre, kupo ?${prompt}
  12181: |-
    Tu veux essayer, kupo ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bien sûr !
    Pas aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  12182: |-
    Merveilleux ! Magnifique !
    Tout d'abord, j'aurai besoin que tu me rapportes ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}
  12183: |-
    Ils sont nécessaires pour canaliser la magie mog ancienne, tu vois.
    Tu devras aussi accumuler ${number: 0} point${choice-plurality: 0} de mérite pour fournir l'énergie nécessaire pour déclencher la réaction, kupo.${prompt}
  12184: |-
    Je vais passer mon tour sur celui-là, j'ai peur.
    J'ai peut-être maîtrisé les arts martiaux, mais je sais qu'il vaut mieux ne pas se mêler de la magie mog. Heh heh heh...
    Allez, va les chercher !${prompt}
  12185: |-
    Dis pas ça, kupo !
    Ah, mais ce n'est pas à un mog de remettre en question le jugement d'un aventurier accompli comme toi.
    Reviens si tu as un jour un changement d'avis.${prompt}
  12186: 'As-tu acquis les ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} et les ${number: 2} point${choice-plurality: 2} de mérite nécessaires pour transcender tes limites, kupo ?${prompt}'

    Si c'est le cas, alors échange-moi les ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} et nous serons en route !
    Mes ailes frémissent d'impatience !${prompt}
  12188: Ou êtes-vous simplement venu pour entendre parler des points de mérite, kupo?${prompt}
  12189: 'L’incantation moogle ancienne nécessite ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} et ${number: 2} point${choice-plurality: 2} de mérite[/s], kupo.${prompt}'

    Je vous appellerais par votre vrai nom si vous disiez à quelqu'un ce que c'est vraiment !
    Mais non, la Confrérie Moogle doit toujours être enveloppée de secret, kupo...${prompt}
  12194: Vous moqueriez-vous de la sagesse de vos ancêtres, kupo ?${prompt}
  12195: (J'ai l'esprit à les écraser tous les deux dans le prochain millénaire s'ils ne se calment pas...)${prompt}
  12196: En tout cas, si vous voulez bien vous accroupir ici, kupo...${prompt}
  12197: <Marmonnement, grognement>... Je suis prêt, kupo.${prompt}
  12198: |-
    Excellent ! Notre ami magien ici lancera une dose puissante de magie moogle directement sur vous.
    Tout ce que vous avez à faire, mon cher aventurier, c'est de rester en vie ! Facile, n'est-ce pas, kupo ?${prompt}

    Mais pourquoi restez-vous encore là ?
    Un tout nouveau monde vous attend à explorer, kupo !${prompt}

    Permettez-moi de deviner, kupo.
    Vous avez entendu parler de ma dernière méthode miraculeuse pour renforcer les pouvoirs déjà puissants des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  12208: Oui, l'expression positivement esuriente sur votre visage me dit tout ce que j'ai besoin de savoir.${prompt}
  12209: Y a-t-il un moment où votre penchant pour le pouvoir sera satisfait, kupo ?${prompt}
  12210: Cela ne doit pas être facile, se promener comme un véritable avatar de l'avidité et de l'avidité.${prompt}
  12211: |-
    Cela dit, j'ai pris goût à votre genre, kupo.
    Et puisque vous avez été un si merveilleux cobaye la dernière fois, je serais positivement ravi de vous expérimenter à nouveau !${prompt}
  12212: |-
    Cela dit, je dois vous prévenir que je suis encore en train de régler certains détails.
    Je ne peux vous donner aucune garantie cette fois-ci.${prompt}
  12213: Autrement dit, ne venez pas pleurer si votre niveau de force finit par chuter précipitamment, kupo !${prompt}
  12214: Are you still keen for the challenge?${prompt}
  12215: |-
    Give it a go, kupo?

    Ever the confident one, I see.
    Very well! Go procure the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} needed for the procedure...${prompt}

    Same deal as last time. Got it, kupo?
    And today, we'll also be recruiting the services of a very special guest!${prompt}
  12229: Howdy-ho, fatty-watties!${prompt}
  12230: Ladies and gentlemoogles, I proudly present Parike-Poranke, esteemed researcher of enterological magic from the Windurstian Orastery, who was kind enough to take time away from his data-gathering for this especial occasion, kupo!${prompt}

    (Parike-Poranke? The self-styled brown mage?
    Why do I get the feelin' we're in for a real mess this time...?)${prompt}

  12233: |-
    I've been hopin' to test out my latest laxative spell, but lately my lab's been as barren as a set of freshly evacuated bowels.
    This is just the belly-bursting opportunity I've been looking for!${prompt}
  12234: |-
    ...Ahem. To make room for a fresh fount of power inside you, we must first expel the old.
    A simple truth, no, kupo? ${prompt}

  12236: '...${prompt}'
  12237: |-
    ...Very well. Come and kneel down right before me, ${name-player}...

    Alright!!!
    Prepare to have your innards turned inside out!${prompt}

  12240: |-
    ...Understood.
    I am ready whenever the rest of you are.${prompt}
  12241: |-
    Then let us begin!

    Bulging...belly...!

    Success! Ahahaha, glorious success!!!
    The last time I tried that one, I was scrubbing my lab clean for a month!${prompt}

  12249: |-
    (How curious. The more excruciating the pain they endure, the stronger these adventurers grow.
    Perhaps my trials are not as torturous as they should be...?)${prompt}
  12250: |-
    Ahem...er, nothing. Nothing at all!
    You look in fine fettle, my adventuring friend.
    Go out there and get 'em! Farewell, kupo!${prompt}
  12251: |-
    I can't thank you enough! Why, you've given me enough data to write a year's worth of reports.
    Next time you're feeling a little backy-wacked up, you know who to call! Ta-taru!${prompt}
  12252: Rejoice, ${name-player}, for the procedure was a staggering success!${prompt}

    Whole new horizons await you out there, and I suspect you're feeling famished.

    Great King Kupofried's ghost! Look who's back, and right on schedule.
    However do you always know when to come here, kupo?${prompt}
  12256: |-
    We inflict upon you progressively more profound pain each time, and still you come back for more.
    Are you perhaps a practitioner of a certain Far Eastern religious discipline?${prompt}
  12257: |-
    Or perhaps you were simply dropped on your head as a child.
    Yes, that seems the more likely answer.${prompt}
  12258: But hey, it's your bruised and battered body, not mine, kupo.${prompt}
  12259: Either way, you'll be pleased to know that the previous two experiments are going to feel like child's play compared to what we have in store for you this time.${prompt}
  12260: |-
    And though you'll indubitably ignore me, it's my duty to warn you.
    There's no guarantee things will go as smoothly as last time, kupo.${prompt}

    If you ask me, you're lucky that crazy moogle magic ever worked.

  12263: |-
    Test your limits?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  12264: "How did I know you'd say that? \nVery well. To power the process this time, we'll be needing ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}"

    And you'll need to prime your own physical energies by storing up ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].
    No exceptions, kupo.${prompt}

    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s back!

  12271: |-
    Or did you come to hear me talk about merit points?
    Because I can do that too, kupo.${prompt}
  12272: |-
    I'm afraid your physical energies are not sufficiently primed.
    Remember, you need ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] if you want to test your limits.${prompt}
  12273: |-
    Well, it looks like you're all ready.
    And if you're ready, why, I'm more than ready.
    <Ahem>... Yoo-hoooooo, kupoooooo!${prompt}

  12278: |-
    Ten years. Ten long years I walked through fire and ice, subjected my body and mind to the harshest of trainin'.

  12279: What!? M-me?${prompt}
  12280: |-
    Oh, do forgive me, Mister Degenhard.
    I neglected to notify you that ${name-player} here would be your opponent today.${prompt}
  12281: Maat... I face my battles with honor. The battle garb I wear is proof enough of that.${prompt}
  12282: |-
    I thought you a worthy opponent, and yet you summon me all the way to Jeuno on some cruel jest?
    In all my long years, I have never suffered such dishonor!${prompt}
  12283: |-
    For this, you will get no mercy from me!
    No mercy!!!${prompt}
  12284: |-
    Wait a minute, old friend!
    What is this talk of settling scores? Why, I never--${prompt}
  12285: |-
    Hah! Do not play the fool, Maat!
    It was written plain as day on your letter of challenge.
    “If you think yourself worthy of wearing ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you must defeat me in single combat!”${prompt}
  12286: |-
    (Whoever could have penned such a preposterous missive?
    Oh, that's right...it was me, kupo!)${prompt}
  12287: |-
    You break your promise, now I break you! Like you break your promise.
    Hieeeeee-yah!${prompt}
  12288: W-wait, Degenhard. This...this is madness!${prompt}
  12289: |-
    Oh, good gracious me, ${name-player}!
    He's preparing to come at Maat with every technique both in and out of the book, kupo!${prompt}

    There are three types of auras, indicating three of the most advanced, awe-inspiring bushin techniques.

    Very well!
    You're as good a subject as any for my chic, unique technique.${prompt}
  12372: |-
    But first, a matter of procedure.
    As there may be a few minor risks involved, I'll have to ask you to sign a simple contractaru.
    Do that, and I'll pump up your powers with a minimum of fussy-wuss.${prompt}
  12373: |-
    A contract?
    It couldn't be...${prompt}

    So what's the good word, ${name-player}?

    How aboutaru it?

    Sign me up!
    About merit points...
    Goodbye.${prompt}
  12380: |-
    Now that's the answer I was looking for!
    Very well, then! I'll just be needing a few things from you.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, to startaru. Ah yes, and a healthy-wealthy dose of intestinal fortitude.${prompt}
  12381: |-
    “Intestinal fortitude,” kupo...?
    That's an awfully ambiguous order, my diminutive friend.${prompt}
  12382: |-
    One would think you'd have a bit more imagination in that swollen-wollen head of yours.
    I speak, of course, of the “marinara points” you always requestaru of these adventurers.${prompt}
  12383: |-
    Ah, mouthwatering morsels of select seafood and pasta boiled to perfection...!
    ...Ahem. Do you perhaps speak of “merit” points?${prompt}

    Ahem, I mean, we'll be ready to roll.${prompt}
  12385: |-

    And what's in it for me? Hmmm?
    Why, I don't even like pickles! Yeech!${prompt}

    Ah, the tragedy of it all!
    It's common knowledge that the pickle-hater misses out on at least eighty percentaru of life's pleasures!${prompt}
  12399: Ah, but the remaining twenty percent tastes infinitely as sweetaru, untainted by the sour, unsavory flavor of those foul foodstuffs!${prompt}
  12400: |-
    I, for one, am developing an exceedingly unpleasant taste in my mouth just listening to this pointless palaver.
    Is this young lady your assistant, kupo?${prompt}
  12401: |-
    Ah, forgive me.
    This is Chumbawumba, a purveyor of pickle-wickles who--as you can see--is most desperataru to distribute her wares.${prompt}

    That's Chamama!

    Now step rightaru this way, won't you?${prompt}
  12406: Something about this is tying my sensitive stomach in knots, kupo...${prompt}
  12407: |-
    ${name-player}, listen well. My ancient Eastern technique will trigger a miracu-waculous process inside your body.
    You might feel a bit odd at first, but pay it no mind.${prompt}
  12408: |-
    Incubate it carefully, and then, when the urge calls, I want you to squeeze with all your mightaru!
    Succeed and you will expel the physical embodiment of the profound life energies that lie dormantaru within you.${prompt}
  12409: |-
    It's all in the timing. Ten beats of your heart--ten seconds--should do the trick.
    Discharge it too early and it will disintegrate into dustaru. Wait too long and we'll have a foul mass as rotten-wotten as Chupawupa's pickled rodent tails.${prompt}
  12410: |-
    Hmm? Discharge what? No need to sweataru the details, friend!
    Anyhoodles, as a final step, my lovely-wovely assistant will weigh your, er, evacuated matter.
    I daresay three pickling stones' weight would do just perfectly.${prompt}
  12411: |-
    Well, aren't you in luck!

    I trust you still have your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Hand it over, if you would.${prompt}
  12471: |-
    Such a lovely shimmer and sheen.
    Yes, I reckon-weckon you're ready to face your ultimate challenge--me.${prompt}
  12472: |-
    Or, how shall I say it...a part of me?
    After all, were I to unleash my full strength, I might mistakenly blastaru you into dust with an errant tap of my pinkie-winkie finger.${prompt}
  12473: |-
    Accept the challenge?
    ${selection-lines}
    But of course!
    Maybe another time.${prompt}
  12474: |-
    Don't tell me you're thinking of reneging on our contract, ${name-player}.
    That would make me mostaru unhappy...and you don't want to see me unhappy.${prompt}
  12475: |-
    I understand. These things take time.
    Friends and family to say farewells to, last will and testament to draftaru...
    Just don't keep me waiting for long.${prompt}
  12476: Are you ready to meet your mak--er, your final challenge, kupo?${prompt}
  12477: |-
    That's the spiritaru!
    Then prepare yourself and meet me at a suitable venue--Horlais Peak, Waughroon Shrine, Balga's Dais, or Qu'Bia Arena should suffice.${prompt}
  12478: |-
    Toodle-woodles for now, my mangy confrere.
    Don't forget to furnish our friend here with the present I left for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  12479: |-
    Consider yourself lucky, kupo!
    It's rare indeed that Atori-Tutori offers to go mano a mano with an adventurer like you.${prompt}
  12480: '...${prompt}'
  12481: |-
    Maat?
    Is something the matter, kupo?${prompt}
  12482: At long last, the time has come...${prompt}
  12483: |-
    I can offer no advice but this, young one.
    Ready yourself in body and mind, and prepare for the fight of your life.${prompt}
  12484: |-
    Kupopopo... What is this oppressively ominous mood?
    No siree, this simply won't do!${prompt}
  12485: |-
    So here's some advice of my own.
    Find yourself some friends to bring to the battle, kupo!${prompt}
  12486: Up to five shouldn't give that overconfident Taru cause to complain...much.${prompt}
  12487: |-
    Oh, and ${name-player}, don't forget this.
    It's a personal present from Atori-Tutori himself!${prompt}
  12488: 'Word has it its energies will be released when paired with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12489: |-
    Oh, and if you're looking for a lift, I can moogle-magick you to your final showdown in two shakes of a rarab's tail.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  12490: |-
    Where to, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Horlais Peak.
    Waughroon Shrine.
    Balga's Dais.
    Qu'Bia Arena.
    Nowhere yet.${prompt}
  12491: |-
    Is that so?
    Then come back whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12492: |-
    Then away you go!
    It was nice knowing you, kupo!${prompt}
  12493: Anyhow, if you're feelin' the butterflies before the battle o' your life, ${name-player}, why don't you pay ol' Degenhard a visit?${prompt}
  12494: |-
    Hah! Yah! Can't ye see I'm... Wait a minute.
    I almost didn't recognize ye...${prompt}
  12495: |-
    Looks like someone's come a long way since our last meetin'.
    Why don't I give ye somethin' that might help in yer training?${prompt}
  12496: |-
    But first, I'm gonna need proof that ye're ready.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} should do the trick.${prompt}
  12497: |-
    Don't ye give me that face.
    It's trainin'--it ain't supposed to be easy!${prompt}
  12498: |-
    Well, looks like someone's ready for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] next challenge.
    As promised, here's somethin' for ya.${prompt}
  12499: |-
    It's a present from our friend Chamama.
    As for how it's going to help yer trainin', ye've got me...${prompt}
  12500: |-
    Kupopopo...
    Those bumps and bruises...don't tell me you failed, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12501: |-
    Don't get too down and discouraged. Atori-Tutori is a formidable foe, after all.
    Fortunately, he's supplied me with ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} to spare!${prompt}
  12502: However, I fear I can't offer them for free...${prompt}
  12503: |-
    Atori-Tutori made me promise to exact a payment of ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] or ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.
    He says it's part and parcel of your training, kupo.${prompt}
  12504: |-
    Why, you already possess ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s], you say!?
    Would you like to use ${choice-plurality: 1}[it/them] right away?${prompt}
  12505: |-
    Spend ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  12506: Whenever you're ready, I'll be here, kupo!${prompt}
  12507: 'Excellent! ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] paid, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12508: 'Splendid! ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12509: 'As promised, here''s a spare ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} from my stock.${prompt}'
  12510: Will you be heading straight to the showdown?${prompt}
  12511: Kupo-ho? Have we met, kupo?${prompt}
  12512: |-
    Wait... Could it be?
    ${name-player}...?${prompt}
  12513: Ye've done it! Ye've truly done it!${prompt}
  12514: Oh, ${name-player}! I knew all along that if anyone could wipe the smirk off that self-satisfied Taru's face, it would be you!${prompt}
  12515: Though I must confess some curiosity as to the conditions of that “contractaru” you signed, kupo...${prompt}
  12516: Heh... If y' must know...${prompt}
  12517: It involves bein' woken up at the crack o' dawn for sparrin' matches after doin' a hundred push-ups on your knuckles...${prompt}
  12518: Eatin' all the rarab tails delivered to the Tenshodo from one of Atori-Tutori's acquaintances...${prompt}
  12519: Wranglin' herds of wild sheep and countin' them one by one whenever he can't sleep...${prompt}
  12520: |-
    ...'n much, much worse.
    Sends a shiver through these old bones just thinkin' about it...${prompt}
  12521: |-
    Egads, kupo!
    That is a most appalling arrangement indeed!${prompt}
  12522: |-
    Wait a minute.
    How is it that you're privy to all those particulars, Maat?${prompt}
  12523: |-
    Hm!? R-rumors, that's all!
    When ye've been around as long as I have, ye hear a thing or two!${prompt}
  12524: |-
    Anyway, enough talk!
    My daily trainin' regimen calls!${prompt}
  12525: |-
    Come now, ${name-player}.
    It's no time for slumping shoulders and sunk spirits.${prompt}
  12526: |-
    After all, I'm sure it's all part of your training.
    Keep it up, and you'll be positively pulsating with power in no time flat!${prompt}
  12527: |-
    You were right, old friend.
    I never thoughtaru ${choice-player-gender}[he'd/she'd] come this far...${prompt}
  12528: |-
    That's my ${name-player}.
    In all the time I've known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], I've never once known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to back down from a challenge.${prompt}
  12529: Why, when I think back to the days when ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was still a rookie with more ambition 'n sense...${prompt}
  12530: |-
    ...<Sniff>...
    That's odd, seems t' be some water in my eyes...${prompt}
  12531: Save those tears, Maat.${prompt}
  12532: While ${name-player}'s achievements are admirable indeed, those adventurers who strive to reach the pinnacle of their powers remain few and far between.${prompt}
  12533: |-
    We must not ease up on them.
    For it is in their hands that the fate of our Vana'diel lies...${prompt}
  12534: Your level limit is now 99!
  12535: |-
    Speak of the ${choice-player-gender}[savior/starlet], kupo.
    I just overheard an earful of an engaging exhortation on “${color: 5}job points${color: 1}” and figured it was imperative that I inform you immediately!${prompt}
  12536: Accomplished adventurers such as yourself can accrue these points by progressing prolifically in their professions. But beware, for the road is rockier than anything related to limit points, kupo.${prompt}
  12537: '...However, I''m confident you''ll conquer the cornucopia of crimps and clogs that could block your way to glory.${prompt}'
  12538: |-
    Do you believe you have what it takes?
    ${selection-lines}
    Without a doubt!
    Not at the moment...${prompt}
  12539: |-
    That's what I wanted to hear, kupo!
    Your sheer determination fairly fills me with a fulgent felicity.${prompt}
  12540: Henceforth, you shall be able to select “Job Points” under the “Status” menu as long as your main job has the reached the resplendent realm of level 99, kupo.${prompt}
  12541: You can fervently fiddle with your faculties there, but only while inhabiting the interior of your Mog House or galavanting about your Mog Garden.${prompt}
  12542: The ${name-npc} casts a strange and slightly unnerving spell upon you.${prompt}
  12543: Hmph, and here I hypothesized you were brimming with boldness and bravery. Well, just talk to me when your gut gives you the go sign, kupo!${prompt}
  12544: Those three stars shining above your head are indescribably inspiring, kupo!${prompt}
  12545: And surely you seek more superlative strength!${prompt}
  12546: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Must have more power...
    I'm strong enough, thanks.${prompt}
  12547: The trials and tribulations you must tackle are terrifying, kupo. Are you absolutely positive?${prompt}
  12548: |-
    Are you positive?
    ${selection-lines}
    Beyond a doubt.
    Not if it's hard...${prompt}
  12549: Then I shall bequeath to you a treasured tool--the master breaker!${prompt}
  12550: With this, you will be able to advance in master levels for jobs you have mastered, kupo.${prompt}
  12551: Only through battling the most boisterous baddies can you increase your master level.${prompt}
  12552: Alas, I fear if you fall, your master level might similarly shrink, kupo.${prompt}
  12553: You can check your current master level via the main menu if your main job is level 99 and you have reached job master status.${prompt}
  12554: Increasing your master level will increase a variety of attributes, so do your best!${prompt}
  12555: I will be waiting here whenever you are ready.${prompt}
  12556: ${name-npc} enchants you with a terrifying force.${prompt}
  12557: |-
    ${name-player}.
    What business do you have here today?
    If you seek Captain Wolfgang, he is currently...${prompt}
  12558: |-
    You are here about the girl, Prishe?
    And the warrant for her arrest?${prompt}
  12559: She presented herself at the palace of her own free will, not so long ago.${prompt}
  12560: Naturally, she was taken into custody, but her demands for an audience with a higher authority are becoming increasingly vocal.${prompt}
  12561: I wonder if Captain Wolfgang will return from his duties any time in the near future...${prompt}
  12562: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12563: I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but...could you walk with me for a moment?${prompt}
  12564: Why would Prishe surrender herself so easily...?${prompt}
  12565: I have no idea what she could be thinking.${prompt}
  12566: Thank the mercy of Altana that Prishe has escaped any punishment while the Jeunoan government is occupied with other matters.${prompt}
  12567: If we could only use this opportunity to rescue her somehow...${prompt}
  12568: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Ulmia!
  12569: Tenzen!${prompt}
  12570: |-
    I am glad to have found you.
    You have heard of young Lady Prishe's predicament?${prompt}
  12571: We need to gather everyone together to unite our actions and plan our next move.${prompt}
  12572: The rest of our friends are waiting in a tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12573: A tavern in Upper Jeuno...?${prompt}
  12574: Aldo has used his influence to secure the establishment for our exclusive use, if only for a short while.${prompt}
  12575: |-
    I will await you on the premises.
    Until then.${prompt}
  12576: What could be the purpose for this meeting being held at the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno?${prompt}
  12577: If that Aldo is involved, I am positive it cannot be anything good. Just keep me out of it. If I lose this job, I'm through!${prompt}
  12578: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12579: |-
    I must apologize for my childish behavior.
    I never should have run off in such a flustered state.${prompt}
  12580: I do understand what everyone is saying.${prompt}
  12581: I understand that the Wyrmking, Bahamut, plans to obliterate all the peoples of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12582: Even with the might of the Jeuno Armada, many more innocent lives will be lost in this conflict if something is not done.${prompt}
  12583: And I do understand that everyone truly wishes to rescue Prishe from her destiny...${prompt}
  12584: |-
    However, it is as Lord Diabolos has said.
    We cannot save both the world and all of her people.${prompt}
  12585: |-
    Lord Diabolos...
    I wonder if he called Prishe into his dreamworld because he knew the truth of her identity--that she is the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12586: |-
    Was Cardinal Mildaurion also aware of this truth?
    Is that why she gave Prishe that amulet?
    But I still...${prompt}
  12587: ${name-player}, it may be too late at this point, but there is something I must tell you.${prompt}
  12588: When Prishe had collapsed, and her amulet was stolen...${prompt}
  12589: It was only for a second, but I'm pretty damn sure.${prompt}
  12590: |-
    The presence I felt when the amulet was stolen...
    It was definitely Miss Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12591: You're saying that Cardinal Mildaurion took the amulet from you?${prompt}
  12592: |-
    Why would she act in such a manner?
    Did not the cardinal give the amulet to you as a gift?${prompt}
  12593: |-
    Yeah, she did.
    Miss Mildaurion was always watching over me through the amulet.${prompt}
  12594: She was always making sure I wasn't thinking of doing something stupid or getting myself into trouble.${prompt}
  12595: But she needed to take the amulet back.${prompt}
  12596: An old, old friend she'd waited a long, long time for had finally returned...${prompt}
  12597: |-
    She apologized to me in her thoughts.
    Said that I would be safe while I was in Jeuno...${prompt}
  12598: But then...${prompt}
  12599: Cardinal Mildaurion would have known that we, the survivors of the Great War, were unable to leave the island...${prompt}
  12600: |-
    She knew, but she did not come to help us.
    She abandoned us to our fate...?${prompt}
  12601: |-
    No, I don't think so.
    Miss Mildaurion left it to me.${prompt}
  12602: Left what to you...?${prompt}
  12603: What was Prishe about to say, I wonder.${prompt}
  12604: |-
    What could Cardinal Mildaurion have entrusted to us?
    Surely not the resurrection of the Twilight God...?${prompt}
  12605: It might be naive of me to believe that you are on my side.${prompt}
  12606: However, I am not willing to give up.${prompt}
  12607: I want to sing of a world where both Vana'diel and all of her people are saved.${prompt}
  12608: Will you dream of such a world alongside me?${prompt}
  12609: |-
    Do you dare to dream?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'll fight to the end!
    Reality is not that kind...${prompt}
  12610: Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12611: |-
    I am sorry.
    I have asked too much without considering your feelings.${prompt}
  12612: |-
    I will once again go to the Grand Duke Palace.
    I've not found anyone in town who has information, but Makki-Chebukki and the others have probably tracked down some rumors.${prompt}
  12613: |-
    There must be something we can do to save Prishe...
    There must be someone who knows of the cardinal...${prompt}
  12614: |-
    ${name-player}!
    What are you doing here!?${prompt}
  12615: Have you found some means to stop the Wyrmking, Bahamut?${prompt}
  12616: |-
    The battle will soon begin.
    An airship carrying a group of adventurers was downed in an attack by the wyrms.${prompt}
  12617: We have completed preparations on the warships, and nothing remains to be done.${prompt}
  12618: |-
    Only...
    I don't know if this is good news or bad news to you, but the commander of the Jeunoan Armada, Lady Esha'ntarl, is nowhere to be found!${prompt}
  12619: |-
    Lord Nag'molada has also disappeared without so much as an escort...
    Dammit! This wouldn't be your doing, would it!?${prompt}
  12620: |-
    Is this your doing?
    ${selection-lines}
    All part of my plan.
    Of course not!${prompt}
  12621: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, this is no time for sarcasm.
    Forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12622: |-
    My apologies.
    You must forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12623: No matter how much one despises senseless bloodshed, there are few who can stand by while their home is burned to the ground.${prompt}
  12624: And so, if it means saving Jeuno from the wyrms, I have no choice but to cooperate with this race of ancients.${prompt}
  12625: |-
    Captain Wolfgang!
    The criminals who escaped with warship zero-three have been identified!${prompt}
  12626: |-
    It appears to be the work of those three Tarutaru!
    We have a witness who overheard them talking about heading to a place they referred to as the “fated land.”${prompt}
  12627: |-
    They took a warship!?
    Is it possible they know where our missing officials have disappeared to!?${prompt}
  12628: |-
    And where is this “fated land” they spoke of!?
    Split up and find some answers!${prompt}
  12629: Where could this “fated land” be? I wouldn't even know where to start looking.${prompt}
  12630: But now that I think of it, I could have sworn I heard that name somewhere before... Where was it...?${prompt}
  12631: |-
    You adventurers are quick to hear the news!
    Lady Esha'ntarl has returned to us!${prompt}
  12632: The Jeunoan Armada has been authorized to begin an assault on the wyrms!${prompt}
  12633: |-
    We are conducting final flight inspections on all vessels.
    Please keep out of the way and allow the engineers to do their job.${prompt}
  12634: Waaah! <sniff>
  12635: Waaah! <snuffle>
  12636: Waaah! <gurgle>
  12637: |-
    What a racket.
    Those Tarutaru were punished for their crimes of stealing a warship and flying out of Jeuno.${prompt}
  12638: 'They claim they were just following orders, but Lord Nag''molada is also awaiting disciplinary action to be decided by the ${choice: 0}[Armathrwn Society/archduke].${prompt}'
  12639: No matter your position, if you break the law...${prompt}
  12640: Hm? Isn't that lady a friend of yours?${prompt}
  12641: Oh, you three!
  12642: Whatever is the matter?${prompt}
  12643: |-
    Come now, no more tears.
    Surely things are not that bad?${prompt}
  12644: We're done for.${prompt}
  12645: Our necks are on the chopping block.${prompt}
  12646: We've gotta get out of here!${prompt}
  12647: |-
    Whatever for?
    There are rumors all over town about the brave Tarutaru who saved an important official.${prompt}
  12648: Is there some other terrible failure that you are regretting?${prompt}
  12649: |-
    No, we've done everything right.
    We used the right blend of deceit and betrayal, honey and vinegar...${prompt}
  12650: We bribed the townsfolk, and avoided the authorities...${prompt}
  12651: We've groomed ourselves into the perfect candidates to become bureaucrats of the future...${prompt}
  12652: They have to run off because I showed up.${prompt}
  12653: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12654: |-
    What the hell is wrong with you!?
    If you keep this up, I'm gonna start rethinking my plan to put you in charge of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12655: |-
    Get yourselves together, or I'm gonna kick you into next Watersday!
    You have a responsibility to look out for Ulmia and everyone else in the Marquisate!${prompt}
  12656: Wh-what?${prompt}
  12657: Sorry to fly off without an explanation, Ulmia.${prompt}
  12658: |-
    And you, ${name-player}.
    Thanks for worrying about me.${prompt}
  12659: |-
    There's not much time, but I'll tell you what I know.
    Get yourselves to the audience chamber.${prompt}
  12660: Prishe...?${prompt}
  12661: |-
    Ah, that energetic young Elvaan girl just entered the audience chamber.
    Hmmm... I thought she had been taken into custody...${prompt}
  12662: With all the preparations for the launch of the armada, there are currently few people remaining in the Grand Palace. I wonder who gave the girl permission to enter...${prompt}
  12663: |-
    Hello, Ulmia.
    You've been through quite an ordeal.${prompt}
  12664: C-Cardinal Mildaurion...!?${prompt}
  12665: What is going on...?${prompt}
  12666: |-
    I am sorry, Ulmia.
    We don't have time for lengthy explanations.${prompt}
  12667: However, there is one thing that I must tell you.${prompt}
  12668: My true name is Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  12669: Ten thousand years ago I was born in Al'Taieu, the city that enfolds the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12670: Nag'molada, and the other members of the Armathrwn Society that now govern Jeuno, are also of an ancient race of people--a race recently awoken from a centuries-long sleep.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    But I am different from the others.
    Through an unusual twist of fate, I was granted immortality.${prompt}
  12672: '!?${prompt}'
  12673: I pledged to use this unending life to bring to fruition the pact made between Selh'teus and the terrestrial avatars.${prompt}
  12674: |-
    After the passing of ten thousand years, a child of destiny would be born in the fated land.
    The Keeper of the Apocalypse...the one I have sworn to destroy.${prompt}
  12675: I have spent many years preparing for the coming of the keeper.${prompt}
  12676: It has been an incredibly long journey.${prompt}
  12677: I have traveled to the far reaches of Vana'diel in search of lost secrets...${prompt}
  12678: I have found solace and encouragement in the many encounters I have had along the way...${prompt}
  12679: But then, when I came to a certain place, I was warned:${prompt}
  12680: Destroying the Keeper of the Apocalypse will merely set the darkness free to reincarnate in another body.${prompt}
  12681: To break this cycle, the darkness itself must be obliterated.${prompt}
  12682: It must be erased from the place where all life originates and where all life eventually returns--the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12683: To fully eradicate the darkness, the Keeper of the Apocalypse must be destroyed not in the form of a human, but in the form of a god.${prompt}
  12684: That is why I conceived a plan to use the Lay of the Immortals to resurrect Promathia.${prompt}
  12685: Resurrection...and destruction...?${prompt}
  12686: But that plan eventually failed.${prompt}
  12687: At the baptismal ceremony, I...${prompt}
  12688: At that time, I was having my strings pulled by the Emptiness inside me.${prompt}
  12689: I lived in the Tavnazian Cathedral since the time of my earliest memories, and believed that the Gates of Paradise must be opened.${prompt}
  12690: But as my bad luck would have it, the Emptiness inside me reacted to the baptismal vessel and was sealed within this magicite.${prompt}
  12691: |-
    My world was tipped upside down.
    I was suddenly able to read people's thoughts and, just like Cardinal Mildaurion, I never aged another day.${prompt}
  12692: |-
    So that is what happened.
    You were the Keeper of the Apocalypse...${prompt}
  12693: |-
    But things are different now.
    You are no longer the one, are you?${prompt}
  12694: '...${prompt}'
  12695: Are you saying that nothing has changed? What is to happen to Prishe?${prompt}
  12696: Judging by the actions of Bahamut, the keeper is still among us.${prompt}
  12697: But over the last twenty years I have watched over the lands of Vana'diel, I have seen no other possible incarnations...${prompt}
  12698: Bahamut wishes to see me smashed to bits in the form of the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12699: It was Diabolos that let me in on my destiny as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12700: It is my fate to be destroyed along with this magicite, and set adrift from the cycle of the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12701: No! This is too horrible!${prompt}
  12702: |-
    Listen to me, Ulmia.
    We've come pretty far in this quest.
    I've already heard four of the verses needed to resurrect the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12703: Once we have the last verse, we can finally stand before Bahamut...!${prompt}
  12704: |-
    Please, Prishe!
    Do you hear what you are saying!?${prompt}
  12705: |-
    How can I let you offer your very existence to Promathia?
    There must be another way...!${prompt}
  12706: |-
    Calm yourself, Ulmia.
    Prishe will not be coming with us.${prompt}
  12707: The last verse of the “Memoria de la S^tona” no longer exists, and there is no weapon left to battle the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12708: Pitting the full force of Jeuno against the wyrms is our only recourse.${prompt}
  12709: There is no other way to save the children of Altana from extinction.${prompt}
  12710: But Miss Mildaurion! What about me?${prompt}
  12711: |-
    Lady Esha'ntarl!
    The Jeunoan Armada is prepared for battle!${prompt}
  12712: |-
    I must go.
    Beyond the sea of endless clouds.${prompt}
  12713: Cardinal Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12714: |-
    Prishe. Ulmia.
    It is only a matter of time until Jeuno becomes a war zone.${prompt}
  12715: I will prepare an airship for your return to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12716: Protect that which is most dear to you.${prompt}
  12717: |-
    Dammit!
    There's no way in hell it's ending this way!
    It's time to put it all on the line!${prompt}
  12718: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12719: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Ulmia!${prompt}
  12720: I know you guys can do it!${prompt}
  12721: You're strong enough now to beat the hell out of me when I become Promathia...${prompt}
  12722: |-
    Listen, there is someone in Selbina who knows the fifth verse.
    Her memory is a little shoddy, though...${prompt}
  12723: Find the fifth verse!${prompt}
  12724: |-
    I need you to do this!
    You hear me!?${prompt}
  12725: |-
    I cannot...!
    Prishe, wait!${prompt}
  12726: Ulmia, I have heard the entire story.${prompt}
  12727: Louverance!?${prompt}
  12728: |-
    This must be the guidance of Altana.
    The girl with a “shoddy memory” in Selbina is well known to me.${prompt}
  12729: |-
    And I also happen to possess the means to revive her past.
    Let us be on our way.${prompt}
  12730: |-
    What?
    Is there a girl in Selbina with a serious case of amnesia?${prompt}
  12731: |-
    How would I know? I'm always confined to my post here in Jeuno.
    You're the adventurer. Why don't you know these things?${prompt}
  12732: Those three Tarutaru brought to Jeuno by Nag'molada have been granted amnesty by Lady Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  12733: However, I don't believe they have much of a future here in the Duchy.${prompt}
  12734: 'Once you have angered ${choice: 0}[the Armathrwn Society/the archduke], it would take no less than a miracle to regain ${choice: 0}[their/his] trust.${prompt}'

    I heard the report.
    The attack against Bahamut failed, but we have dealt him a critical blow.${prompt}
  12737: Lady Esha'ntarl is to join the main fleet and lead our forces in a mass assault.${prompt}
  12738: |-
    She mentioned that she would like to meet with you all before the attack commences.
    You are to meet her for a confidential briefing in the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12739: |-
    Do not keep Lady Esha'ntarl waiting.
    May victory in battle be yours.${prompt}
  12740: Captain Wolfgang has asked me to remind you that you are to hurry to the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12741: It sounded as if it was urgent. You had best be on your way!${prompt}
  12742: Recently, there have been no signs of Nag'molada or those annoying Tarutaru entering the Grand Duke Palace.${prompt}
  12743: I heard from one of the guards that the Tarutaru were seen riding an airship to Bastok, but as for Nag'molada...${prompt}
  12744: |-
    The palace is often the site for grand banquets that are attended by dignitaries from every nation.
    In times like these, we do our utmost to see that the needs of our important visitors are met.${prompt}
  12745: 'Recently, ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag''molada/Lady Esha''ntarl] has been requesting the oddest things from the palace staff.${prompt}'
  12746: These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of the Duchy.${prompt}

  12748: If the requested items could be found in Jeuno, nay, in the markets of any country, we would endeavor to procure them.${prompt}
  12749: |-
    However, many of these objects are not available for purchase.
    I am in quite a quandary, as you can see.${prompt}

    I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12962: |-
    My duty here is done.
    I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.${prompt}
  12963: |-
    I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions.
    You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.${prompt}
  12964: |-
    I have awaited your return, ${name-player}.
    You must tell me all that has happened.${prompt}
  12965: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.${prompt}
  12966: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.${prompt}
  12967: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.${prompt}
  12968: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?${prompt}
  12969: |-
    Has the keeper been defeated?
    ${selection-lines}
    Completely.
    Who can say?${prompt}
  12970: |-
    I knew it!
    Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...${prompt}
  12971: |-
    Tell me.
    What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?${prompt}
  12972: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...${prompt}
  12973: They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...${prompt}
  12974: |-
    The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago.
    Returned to Promathia...${prompt}

    “Opening the Gates of Paradise” is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal.
    A way to return the world to its original state.${prompt}
  12976: |-
    The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood.
    The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.${prompt}
  12977: Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.${prompt}
  12978: She said, “As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.”${prompt}
  12979: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  12980: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  12981: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  12982: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  12983: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  12984: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  12985: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  12986: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  12987: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  12988: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  12989: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  12990: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  12991: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  12992: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  12993: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  12994: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  12995: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  12996: There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12997: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.${prompt}
  12998: But do not misunderstand.${prompt}

  13000: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.${prompt}

    I haven't really thought much about jobs.
    What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?${prompt}
  13164: |-
    Jobs?
    I'll try anything once.
    What style of combat do you recommend?${prompt}
  13165: |-
    I'm not that interested in jobs.
    Give me a style of combat and I'll stick to that.${prompt}
  13166: |-
    There are so many jobs to choose from.
    Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt}
  13167: What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?${prompt}
  13168: Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.${prompt}
  13169: |-
    I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is.
    Do you have any particular style you want me to use?${prompt}
  13170: |-
    No matter the job, I can fight in any style!
    Is there a particular style you recommend?${prompt}
  13171: |-
    Jobs?
    If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me.
    What kind of combat style do you recommend?${prompt}
  13172: I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?${prompt}
  13173: |-
    There are so many jobs to choose from.
    Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt}
  13174: You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?${prompt}
  13175: |-
    Hmm.
    I'll give it a shot.${prompt}
  13176: |-
    Right!
    That's the style for me!${prompt}
  13177: |-
    Hmm.
    I'll try it.${prompt}
  13178: |-
    Okay.
    I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  13179: |-
    Okay then.
    I'll start doing that from next time.${prompt}
  13180: Sounds good! Leave it to me!${prompt}
  13181: Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.${prompt}
  13182: |-
    Okay!
    Sounds like fun!${prompt}

    Okay, I'll try it out.${prompt}

    Hmmm. Okay!
    I'll do my best!${prompt}
  13185: |-
    Okay.
    I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  13186: |-
    Fine.
    I will try your suggested combat style.${prompt}
  13187: |-
    What?
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13188: |-
    My headwear?
    You think it's time for a change?${prompt}
  13189: You don't like my headwear?${prompt}
  13190: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13191: You want to choose new headwear for me?${prompt}
  13192: |-
    You're interested in my headwear?
    Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.${prompt}
  13193: |-
    What? Come on, out with it.
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13194: |-
    Huh!?
    You don't like my headwear?
    Should I wear something else?${prompt}
  13195: |-
    Yes?
    You want me to change my headwear?${prompt}
  13196: |-
    What are you staring at?
    Don't you like my headwear?${prompt}
  13197: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13198: My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.${prompt}
  13199: Well, I guess I could wear something else.${prompt}
  13200: Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.${prompt}
  13201: I'll change it, then.${prompt}
  13202: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13203: Thanks. I'll try this one.${prompt}
  13204: Ooh, I like your style!${prompt}

    Well, okay.
    A change is as good as a holiday!${prompt}
  13207: I'll try something new, then.${prompt}
  13208: Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!${prompt}
  13209: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13210: Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.${prompt}
  13211: I'll forget you said anything, then.${prompt}
  13212: |-
    Oh?
    Okay.${prompt}
  13213: Well, that's a relief.${prompt}
  13214: I'll stay the way I am, then.${prompt}
  13215: |-
    So I don't need to change it?
    Fashion can be so frustrating...${prompt}
  13216: You like me just the way I am, eh?${prompt}
  13217: Well, that's good to hear.${prompt}
  13218: |-
    Are you sure?
    Well, I guess that's a good thing...${prompt}
  13219: |-
    Oh?
    Alright, then.${prompt}
  13220: |-
    Phew!
    I thought you thought I looked funny or something!${prompt}

    You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.${prompt}
  13247: |-
    With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.
    I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt}
  13248: |-
    Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?
    I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!${prompt}
  13249: |-
    Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?
    Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt}
  13250: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13251: |-
    Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?
    An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...${prompt}
  13252: |-
    Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?
    And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt}
  13253: |-
    Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.
    You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt}
  13254: Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...${prompt}
  13255: |-
    Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.
    Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt}
  13256: |-
    I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats?
    Do archdukes eat curry...?${prompt}

    My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno.
    Most likely the part that would form the main body...${prompt}
  13259: |-
    Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.
    A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.${prompt}
  13260: |-
    Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!
    Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  13261: |-
    If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.
    I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt}
  13262: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13263: |-
    Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.
    At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.${prompt}
  13264: |-
    A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out.
    I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt}
  13265: |-
    The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.
    No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt}
  13266: |-
    How embarrassing...
    I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt}
  13267: |-
    Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.
    Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt}
  13268: |-
    Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?
    What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt}
  13269: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13270: |-
    That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--
    A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt}
  13271: Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt}
  13272: |-
    Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?
    No...?${prompt}
  13273: |-
    I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.
    Bastok is a weird place...${prompt}
  13274: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13275: |-
    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?
    I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt}
  13276: I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt}
  13277: I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt}
  13278: I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt}
  13279: |-
    I've never eaten a treant bulb before.
    What do they taste like?${prompt}
  13280: |-
    Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?
    What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt}
  13281: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13282: The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt}
  13283: |-
    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}
  13284: |-
    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13285: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13286: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13287: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13288: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13289: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13290: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  13291: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  13292: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  13293: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13294: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  13295: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  13296: |-
    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13297: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13298: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13299: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13300: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  13301: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  13302: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  13303: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  13304: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  13305: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13306: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13307: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13308: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  13309: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  13310: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13311: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  13312: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  13313: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  13314: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13315: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  13316: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13317: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13318: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13319: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13320: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13321: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13322: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13323: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  13324: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13325: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  13326: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13327: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  13328: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13329: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13330: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13331: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13332: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13333: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13334: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13335: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  13336: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  13337: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  13338: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  13339: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  13340: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13341: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13342: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13344: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13345: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13347: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  13348: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  13349: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  13350: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  13351: I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt}
  13352: |-
    What do you keep in your Mog House?
    Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt}
  13353: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13354: I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt}
  13355: |-
    I have a friend in the business, you see.
    I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt}
  13356: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  13357: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  13358: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  13359: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  13360: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  13361: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  13362: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  13363: |-
    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}
  13364: |-
    It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?
    Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt}

  13691: |-
    Were you waiting for me?
    I'm sorry, but there was no sign of your Mithran friend.
    You might have better luck in a different partaru of the city.${prompt}
  13692: |-
    ${name-player}, I have been looking for you.
    Come. We have confidential matters to discuss.${prompt}
  13693: I must speak with you regarding the Wyrmking Bahamut.${prompt}
  13694: You may recall him returning to the heavens, but I have received confirmation that he has once again descended upon Cape Riverne.${prompt}
  13695: Judging from the activity of the wyrms remaining in the various regions of Vana'diel, I suspected that they had yet to regain their faith in mankind.${prompt}
  13696: |-
    Most importantly, Tavnazia is in danger.
    Prishe and Ulmia have already been informed. I assume that you will also lend them your aid.${prompt}
  13697: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  13698: Then you should head to Cape Riverne. Prishe and Ulmia have probably already departed.${prompt}
  13699: I see you have other matters to attend to. I know that you would not turn your back on Prishe and Ulmia, though.${prompt}
  13700: I am sure we have a little time. Return here when you are ready.${prompt}
  13701: I don't understand. Bahamut is nowhere to be found in Monarch Linn! We've searched all over the south side...${prompt}
  13702: We must be looking on the wrong side. Let's try again, Prishe.${prompt}
  13703: ${name-player}?
  13704: I'm so glad you're here! Nothing could reassure me more than your presence.${prompt}
  13705: A member of the Tavnazian Patrol witnessed Bahamut returning to Cape Riverne with an army of wyrms.${prompt}
  13706: We've looked all over the south side, but Bahamut is nowhere to be found. We're about to begin searching the north side, now.${prompt}
  13707: It will take a while to search every island, so I think we should split up.${prompt}
  13708: Let's go, Prishe.${prompt}
  13709: Oh ${name-player}, I am simply delighted to see you again!${prompt}
  13710: |-
    Surprised?
    I'm a regular girl now, you know! Tehehe!${prompt}
  13711: So, it's you. I knew we would meet again, but I must say, this is sooner than I expected.${prompt}
  13712: You have done well, but you are naive to think that your troubles would end so easily.${prompt}
  13713: What are you planning!?${prompt}
  13714: Your friend here held in her body a crystallized form of the Emptiness. You returned it to the mothercrystals, did you not?${prompt}
  13715: '...!'
  13716: I sense the will that embodied the Emptiness. It has yet to awaken into this world, but it is tremendously powerful.${prompt}
  13717: The mothercrystals are already beginning to feel its effects, enveloped in the Emptiness as they are. It is stirring...${prompt}
  13718: My magicite...${prompt}
  13719: Mankind will be annihilated. You have simply delayed the process.${prompt}
  13720: Do you dare to defy fate once again and fight to preserve your lives?${prompt}
  13721: |-
    Defy fate and fight?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fight and live!
    Fate is inevitable.${prompt}
  13722: 'Children of Vana''diel! ${choice: 0}[Stand in defiance/Accept your fate] and perish! Redeem the world as a part of the mothercrystals!'
  13723: You have delayed mankind's extinction yet again...${prompt}
  13724: An age is a mere flicker to a wyrm. However, enough flickers united form a star.${prompt}
  13725: |-
    Children of Vana'diel.
    Unite and form a future in which mankind can survive.
  13726: Let's go home for now, Prishe.${prompt}
  13727: Okay...${prompt}
  13728: ${name-player}, please tell Cardinal Mildaurion about this the next time you are in Jeuno.${prompt}
  13729: The “Star of Tavnazia”... The stone Prishe released when Promathia was defeated...${prompt}
  13730: The children of Vana'diel harbor the Emptiness inside their bodies, even if just a small amount. I envisioned it causing problems before too many thousands of years passed.${prompt}
  13731: However, I never dreamed that we would face such a threat so soon.${prompt}
  13732: We have no choice now but to stop Bahamut.${prompt}
  13733: I have a feeling that he was waiting for you, desiring a confrontation.${prompt}
  13734: Bahamut pays respect to the strong, regardless of stature. It is for that reason he is called the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13735: |-
    You must gather an army of adventurers and challenge him yet again.
    Show our adversary the strength of mankind!${prompt}
  13736: As for me, I will conduct a thorough investigation of the emanations coming from the mothercrystals. Perhaps I will find something of interest.${prompt}
  13737: If you can unlock all the secrets of Vana'diel, we may meet again. I hope with every fabric of my being that that time will come.${prompt}
  13738: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13739: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but nothing happens.${prompt}'
  13740: We must make preparations and consult with Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  13741: |-
    ${name-player}, there is someone I would like you to meet.
    Please come this way...${prompt}
  13742: |-
    I have a fair idea of what's going on.
    It's surprising to find a Zilartian with a level head on her shoulders.${prompt}
  13743: 'There are four mothercrystal locations: the Crag of Holla, the Crag of Dem, the Crag of Mea, and the ruins of Pso''Xja.${prompt}'
  13744: Our investigation into the Emptiness surrounding these locations has produced some unusual readings.${prompt}
  13745: We put together a research team equipped with the latest weapons--weapons designed to combat the Emptiness--and sent them to Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  13746: And you wouldn't guess who they encountered...${prompt}
  13747: |-
    The ruins of Pso'Xja are under Tenshodo authority.
    Technically speaking, your researchers were trespassing.${prompt}
  13748: Verena had wandered down there like she was being guided by something.${prompt}
  13749: I found this at the place to where I was drawn.${prompt}
  13750: Apparently it belonged to a Galka known as Raogrimm--I'm sure you remember the name.${prompt}
  13751: |-
    Verena was once the receptacle for the memories of the Shadow Lord.
    This must be the reason behind her behavior.${prompt}
  13752: Similar readings have been recorded from the Emptiness found below the crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.${prompt}
  13753: |-
    We have marked the points where the fluctuations were the strongest.
    I would like to entrust the investigation of these areas to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13754: If my intuition on what lies out there is correct, you will make some fascinating discoveries indeed.${prompt}
  13755: |-
    You're a brave soul, ${name-player}.
    You'll never catch me in that awful place again.
    Once is more than enough...${prompt}
  13756: |-
    Please be careful.
    We'll be praying for your safe return.${prompt}
  13757: So these are what were causing such unusual activity within the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13758: I can feel the aura of those who returned to the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13759: Nag'molada, Eald'narche, and even Archduke Kam'lanaut...${prompt}
  13760: Could it be possible that these entities are attempting to break back into this world?${prompt}
  13761: |-
    Will they return as they once were?
    Or as something more sinister?${prompt}
  13762: |-
    ${name-player}.
    We must put a stop to this.${prompt}
  13763: These reincarnations are beings that have chosen--and been chosen by--the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13764: |-
    Go. Prepare yourself for battle, then return to me here.
    Let us raise the curtain on the final conflict.${prompt}
  13765: I fear their powers will be beyond any race that has walked Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13766: You hand the three crystal slivers to Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  13767: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Let us discuss what needs to be done.${prompt}
  13768: I have returned from an audience with the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13769: If the Keeper of the Apocalypse is indeed attempting to cross over into this world, there is but one option left to us.${prompt}
  13770: |-
    We force the keeper to appear on our terms.
    Then we crush him.${prompt}
  13771: This was Prishe's original plan.${prompt}
  13772: Ulmia will sing the Lay of the Immortals in the presence of the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13773: |-
    The time has finally come to use the completed song--the verses you discovered on your journey.
    I have faith that Ulmia can perform the piece with little trouble.${prompt}
  13774: |-
    Make your way to the Sealion's Den in Tavnazia.
    Al'Taieu beckons once again.${prompt}
  13775: ${name-player}, I have awaited your arrival.${prompt}
  13776: It is my fault that this terrible thing is occurring--I have no excuses.${prompt}
  13777: I always feared that my act of relinquishing the Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13778: '...would one day bring the world back to the brink of destruction.${prompt}'
  13779: |-
    But to be completely honest, I am overjoyed that this darkness has given us another chance to meet.
    Truly, I am...${prompt}
  13780: |-
    Prishe!
    You stop this nonsense at once!${prompt}
  13781: |-
    Why must you insist on playing the clown at a time like this!?
    You truly are incorrigible!${prompt}
  13782: |-
    Aw, c'mon, Ulmia!
    It's been so long since I've seen ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13783: A normal reunion would be kinda boring, and I just wanted to spice things up a little...${prompt}
  13784: You were just trying to cover up your own awkwardness!${prompt}
  13785: That's...not...true...${prompt}

  13787: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Cardinal Mildaurion will be joining us later.
    Let us begin our journey to the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13788: |-
    Our mission will be a success.
    I know it in my heart.${prompt}
  13789: Prishe, Ulmia, ${name-player}!
  13790: |-
    You seem surprised.
    Well, our last parting of ways did seem somewhat final.${prompt}
  13791: But you couldn't expect us to stay at home shivering in our fur when word of this rrreached us!${prompt}
  13792: |-
    As the...Moblins say...
    “Don't leave...a hole...half...dug...”${prompt}
  13793: Are we digging holes?
  13794: For the graves?${prompt}
  13795: Not very optimistic, are we!${prompt}
  13796: |-
    I never thought I would don this armor again.
    Cardinal Mildaurion is not one to be ignored.${prompt}
  13797: |-
    Wow, the whole gang's here.
    All because of my selfish mistake...${prompt}
  13798: |-
    My apologies...${wait-36: 1}
    And my thanks!${wait-animation: 4}
  13799: |-
    The time has come.
    On to the mothercrystal!${prompt}
  13800: |-
    Hehehe.
    I always wanted to come back to this place.
    Y'know, for a picnic or something.${prompt}
  13801: Still making unrealistic wishes, Prishe?
  13802: |-
    Miss Mildaurion!
    Aldo!?
  13803: |-
    I'm sure you all know Zeid.
    We have a debt to the ancients that needs to be repaid.${prompt}
  13804: |-
    I will also fight alongside you.
    I must see this matter put to rest.${prompt}
  13805: Here they come!
  13806: Bound together...
  13807: By the crystals...
  13808: We will soon...
  13809: Become one...
  13810: There's something else...!
  13811: A fifth person!?${prompt}
  13812: Lion!?
  13813: Hahaha!
  13814: The stone she would not relinquish...!
  13815: It has been shattered by your song...!
  13816: Our divine transformation is at hand!
  13817: This ends now!
  13818: Leave Nag'molada to me!
  13819: You shall be the first...!${prompt}
  13820: The first to taste the vengeance of the dead!${prompt}
  13821: I think we're done here.${prompt}
  13822: |-
    Yes, the battle is over.
    There is only...${prompt}
  13823: |-
    She appears to be unharmed.
    There is some trace of Emptiness, but it will cause nothing more than a few bad dreams.${prompt}
  13824: |-
    Thank Altana...
    It was Lion who leaped into the crystal to save us all.${prompt}
  13825: Her struggle with Eald'narche continued within the stone...${prompt}
  13826: Let's get her home to Norg...${prompt}
  13827: |-
    Your red hair...
    Now I know you.${prompt}
  13828: |-
    The nightmare I had...
    You were the one who carried it on for me.${prompt}
  13829: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Make sure you fulfill your promise when she gets better, okay?${prompt}
  13830: The world only grows larger the longer we live. New lives are born, and new lands are discovered. There're always new adventures to be had.${prompt}
  13831: |-
    But you don't gotta rush in, you know?
    This big world of ours will always be waiting.${prompt}
  13832: Waiting for you.${prompt}
  13833: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  13834: The Near East must be in a dire condition to send mercenary recruiters all the way to Jeuno...${prompt}
  13835: I heard many tales of the Great War from my dear departed father. They all seemed irrelevant to me until now...${prompt}
  13836: |-
    I see you've got a Salaheem's Sentinel badge there...
    They must be desperate to use those as an attention-grabbing device.${prompt}
  13837: Maybe the empress of Aht Urhgan is short on devoted subjects...${prompt}
  13838: Hm? I see you have one of those brass badges that Salaheem's Sentinels are handing out unauthorized. Let me take a look at it.${prompt}
  13839: |-
    Interesting. Objects from the Near East seem to shine with a different light.
    I've heard that the president of Salaheem's Sentinels is quite tight-fisted, but at least this badge is quite luxurious.${prompt}
  13840: |-
    Near Eastern cuisine is all the rage now.
    Lately I've been studying up on it to add some spice to the palace banquets.${prompt}
  13841: Near Eastern cooking is considered one of the leading cuisines in Vana'diel, so I am sure the archduke will be most pleased.${prompt}
  13842: Lately, the Empire of Aht Urhgan has been building up her army. That's sure to make waves internationally...${prompt}
  13843: Do you think we can continue to preserve friendly relations with all three major nations as the balance of power hangs by a thread?${prompt}
  13844: |-
    You have gathered here today at the request of the Kingdom of San d'Oria.
    I thank you on behalf of the king.${prompt}
  13845: |-
    This is the first time in history that an emergency summit of this nature has taken place.
    The issue I lay before you is beyond the scope of a single nation...${prompt}
  13846: |-
    Prince Pieuje!
    The adventurer you have permitted to attend the summit has arrived.${prompt}
  13847: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13848: Allow me to begin by explaining the events that have led to today's meeting.${prompt}
  13849: It began when ${name-player}, mercenary and adventurer, arrived at the gate of the Chateau d'Oraguille bearing a letter of extreme importance.${prompt}
  13850: The contents of that letter prompted me to call the nations together...${prompt}
  13851: It was penned by a sage known as Raillefal, and described in painstaking detail the current state of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13852: This is the same nation that has the port in a frenzy over mercenary recruitment...?${prompt}
  13853: |-
    The very same.
    I speak of the Near Eastern nation, the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13854: The Empire!?${prompt}
  13855: Aht Urhgan is now under pressure from three separate beastman armies, and Al Zahbi, the mighty capital itself, is in danger of falling.${prompt}
  13856: Great Altana...${prompt}
  13857: The Silent Empire...${prompt}
  13858: It was once called that.${prompt}
  13859: You may have been too young to know this, Your Highness, but the rest of us should remember.${prompt}
  13860: '...${prompt}'
  13861: I am aware of the term.${prompt}
  13862: In the time of the Great War, the Empire possessed an army greater than the combined forces of the allied nations.${prompt}
  13863: Yet not a single soldier was sent in response to calls for aid...${prompt}
  13864: |-
    My apologies.
    You are well versed in history.${prompt}
  13865: But knowing this, you should also know that we have no obligation to lift even a finger for Aht Urhgan, no matter how serious her predicament.${prompt}
  13866: |-
    Why, Volker, always so calm and cool.
    You've grown hot and bothered, and your speech is most cruel.${prompt}
  13867: You should understand, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  13868: |-
    You were there on that battlefield.
    Who knows how much suffering could've been avoided if we'd had the help of the Empire...${prompt}
  13869: |-
    On the contrary, my dear musketeer.
    We owe them more than you can imagine, I fear.${prompt}
  13870: What do you mean!?${prompt}
  13871: Aht Urhgan has taken many countries under her yoke...${prompt}
  13872: A ferocious nation that has even bared fangs at the Far Eastern folk.${prompt}
  13873: |-
    Calling the Empire to help in our cause,
    would be like freeing us from demons in return for dragon jaws.${prompt}
  13874: That may be true, but even the close relationship Aht Urhgan had with Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13875: That subject is not--${prompt}
  13876: |-
    ...the issue here, I know.
    Doctor Shantotto, why did Windurst open Mhaura's port to the Empire?${prompt}
  13877: My nation's actions are none of your concern.${prompt}
  13878: At least we have a backbone--when will Bastok learn...?${prompt}
  13879: You go too far, Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
  13880: |-
    Enough!
    I did not call you here to speak of possible troop contributions.${prompt}
  13881: Then why are we here, Your Highness?${prompt}
  13882: Our main concern is the treasure thought to be at the center of this conflict--the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  13883: “Astral Candescence”?${prompt}
  13884: It is described as some manner of musical instrument, but apparently is much more than that.${prompt}
  13885: This instrument is said to produce a phenomenon known as the “Astral Wind,” a breeze that blows from an unidentifiable source.${prompt}
  13886: It creates a melody in a timbre unheard by mortal ears...${prompt}
  13887: |-
    I'm confused.
    How can there be a melody if nothing can be heard...?${prompt}
  13888: Astral Wind...${prompt}
  13889: Hmph. This is all very unusual, but I'm sure we've all seen stranger things before.${prompt}
  13890: An unidentifiable source...${prompt}
  13891: |-
    In Windurst there is no shortage of magical gadgets.
    Pens that write by themselves. Brooms that sweep on command...${prompt}
  13892: A breeze...${prompt}
  13893: |-
    I mean, they even have that Cardian band.
    That's similar, don't you think, Doctor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13894: Astral...${prompt}
  13895: Wind...${prompt}
  13896: |-
    Doctor Shantotto?
    Is everything alright?${prompt}
  13897: '!!!${prompt}'
  13898: Ohohohoho!${prompt}
  13899: |-
    If it's automatic instruments you need,
    our children make such things before they learn how to read!${prompt}
  13900: The problem lies in the power of the wind.${prompt}
  13901: The wind?${prompt}
  13902: |-
    It envelops those close by, and fills them with a mysterious strength.
    There are few who can resist the lure of this energy.${prompt}
  13903: Even among the beastmen...${prompt}
  13904: If the instrument is that dangerous, why not just give it to the beastmen, or smash it out of hand?${prompt}
  13905: |-
    That is what common sense would tell us.
    If it were up to an individual, or even an entire town...${prompt}
  13906: What are you trying to say?${prompt}
  13907: What if that decision lay in the hands of a nation?${prompt}
  13908: Even if it posed a threat to your own citizens, if that treasure could one day be your salvation, would you not choose to protect it?${prompt}
  13909: How could a mere instrument hold that kind of power...?${prompt}
  13910: The sage who composed this letter is afraid...${prompt}
  13911: Afraid that this Astral Candescence will one day be the catalyst for a conflict to rival the Crystal War.${prompt}
  13912: No!${prompt}
  13913: |-
    Prince Pieuje...
    As a representative for an entire nation, you would do well not to throw those words around so lightly!${prompt}
  13914: |-
    My apologies.
    This is merely based on the conjecture of a sage.${prompt}
  13915: Why don't we have ${name-player}, who has seen and heard these things in person, give us ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] account?${prompt}
  13916: '...${prompt}'
  13917: We cannot make a decision based on this tale alone.${prompt}
  13918: A nation has a responsibility to maintain soldiers and weaponry for the defense of its people.${prompt}
  13919: And for a city in this situation, I would go so far as to say that some sort of secret weapon is almost a necessity.${prompt}
  13920: In any case, it doesn't seem that this Astral Candescence presents any immediate danger to the people of Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  13921: |-
    I wouldn't say that was entirely true,
    if you were me, and I were you.${prompt}
  13922: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I came to a conclusion after you left the chateau.${prompt}
  13923: I wish to hear your honest opinion.${prompt}
  13924: |-
    Give Pieuje your honest opinion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13925: |-
    Excellent. I knew asking you here was the right decision.
    I rely upon your vast experience as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13926: Ahaha. Only an adventurer would choose to jest in such company as this.${prompt}
  13927: What is the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13928: If it is such an important treasure, then why not secret it away inside the palace instead of placing it in the area most vulnerable to beastman attacks?${prompt}
  13929: I sense some hidden purpose for this dangerous object...${prompt}
  13930: Do you have any thoughts on the matter, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13931: |-
    Any thoughts?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sage Walahra...
    The Gordeus...
    The Walahra Philosophy...
    Not really...${prompt}
  13932: |-
    ${name-player}.
    If you have nothing to contribute, then there is little point in you being here...${prompt}

    Sage Walahra?

    Hmm.

    The “Gordeus.”
    I have heard this name somewhere before...${prompt}
  13942: What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13943: Not a person? So, it is a holy relic enshrined in Walahra Temple...${prompt}
  13944: In the distant past, Sage Walahra once unraveled the Gordeus and grasped the fundamental principle of existence...${prompt}
  13945: And now a host of like-minded scholars toil day and night to discover the same loose thread to unravel the Gordeus for themselves.${prompt}
  13946: It appears the people of the Empire search for quite different truths than the ones we seek...${prompt}
  13947: |-
    The Walahra Philosophy?
    What manner of learning is this?${prompt}
  13948: What connection does this philosophy have to the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13949: “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”${prompt}
  13950: I do not understand what this “void” they speak of refers to.${prompt}
  13951: Though this philosophy is not so far from our own belief that all life begins and ends with Great Altana and the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13952: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Too much time in the cathedral for Destin's little boy!

    You look for your answers in all the wrong places.
    Shall I bring a little hope to your long, dreary faces?${prompt}
  13955: What are you hiding, Shantotto?${prompt}
  13956: The servants of Walahra control the Hall of Binding--the treasure's little nest.${prompt}
  13957: The Hall of Binding is defended by the Serpent Generals--the best of the best!${prompt}
  13958: |-
    The Serpent Generals?
    A name I have heard. Each one is said to be worth a thousand soldiers.${prompt}
  13959: The Astral Candescence is strictly monitored by the Walahra Temple, according to the adventurer's speech...${prompt}
  13960: But the treasure is kept in an area that the beastmen can easily reach.${prompt}
  13961: And there we find the Serpent Generals, the strongest of the strong...${prompt}
  13962: Plus mercenaries like ${name-player} to help them, if I'm not wrong?${prompt}
  13963: Yes, there does seem to be some contradiction to be found here.${prompt}

    Of course!

    There are some things that even I cannot divine.

  13971: Without concern for the people of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  13972: We need more information.${prompt}
  13973: |-
    Yes.
    An individual of keen wits and sharp senses...${prompt}

  13975: ${name-player} is employed as a mercenary in the Empire.${prompt}
  13976: 'However, ${choice: 0}[she/he] is a distinguished adventurer, who will not sell ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] principles for a bag of gil.${prompt}'
  13977: I point to the safe delivery of the sage's letter as proof of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] dedication.${prompt}
  13978: A long journey without promise of reward.${prompt}
  13979: And I am sure that all of you present have had numerous beneficial dealings with adventurers.${prompt}
  13980: They have earned our trust and respect!${prompt}
  13981: That is why I put forth the motion that we have ${name-player} return to the Empire and fight as a mercenary.${prompt}
  13982: We cannot allow any more blood to be spilled by beastmen, even should that blood belong to another nation's people.${prompt}
  13983: And if ${name-player} can improve ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] standing enough to bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] closer to the Imperial palace...${prompt}
  13984: We may learn the ultimate goal of the Empire.${prompt}

    You'll find no argument here.

  13987: How does the Duchy of Jeuno stand on this?${prompt}
  13988: In agreement.${prompt}
  13989: The linking of our auction house services has strengthened the ties between Jeuno and the Empire, but economical matters are superseded by politics...${prompt}
  13990: All in favor...?${prompt}
  13991: |-
    One moment.
    As Raillefal warned, this problem is not likely to remain constrained within the borders of the Near East.${prompt}
  13992: All the lands of Vana'diel, including our four nations...${prompt}

  13998: It is a trifling amount, but perhaps you might use this Aht Urhgan coin on your travels.${prompt}
  13999: An adventurer is free to choose ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own path...${prompt}
  14000: |-
    However, what I ask of you is for the sake of all Vana'diel.
    I am sure that when the time comes, I can rely on you to perform your duty.${prompt}
  14001: That treasure is more than simple bait...${prompt}
  14002: An astral relic can and will seal your fate.${prompt}

  14050: |-
    I am in full agreement with the captain in this case.
    The Empire's intentions are clear--we must not lose this race.${prompt}
  14051: But if we mobilize our forces, we will be giving the Grand Vizier and his supporters just the ammunition they need to fuel a full-scale war.${prompt}
  14052: The Empress yet retains loyal subjects within Her realm. I believe we can still avoid open confrontation.${prompt}
  14053: |-
    Ohohoho...so unlike you, my dear prince.
    Your sentimental view of the situation is making me wince.${prompt}

  14055: I...${prompt}
  14056: This will be a conflict of epic proportions. Perhaps we should strive harder for a diplomatic solution...${prompt}
  14057: While I agree with you in theory, we walk a dangerous line.${prompt}
  14058: Despite its state of constant warfare, the sprawling Empire commands staggering resources. If we fail to make the first move, we could face casualties on the scale of the Great War.${prompt}
  14059: |-
    The Great War? Surely you jest?
    The carnage from this apocalypse will be far greater than all the rest.${prompt}

    You all know of the Gordeus, I presume?
    It is best we're all aware of this potential source of doom.${prompt}
  14062: One does not lightly forget such an object...${prompt}
  14063: You speak of the sacred artifact kept within the Walahra Temple?${prompt}
  14064: An amazing creation worthy of mention.${prompt}
  14065: But that is not the phenomenon to which I wish to draw your attention.${prompt}
  14066: I refer to an event from nine hundred years before...${prompt}
  14067: The supernova that was born from the earth and stole the night sky for an entire year, as was passed down in lore.${prompt}
  14068: |-
    Ah, now this I recall from my lessons!
    This was the miracle bestowed by the Goddess that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.${prompt}
  14069: After the glare finally faded, this star of the first magnitude became part of the Alexander constellation, correct?${prompt}
  14070: |-
    It was merely a coincidence that the supernova's trajectory passed in front of that star.
    The truth of the matter is more fascinating by far.${prompt}
  14071: The trajectory? I don't understand.${prompt}
  14072: I discovered an ancient papyrus in the extensive vaults of the Optistery.${prompt}
  14073: The following was written in a script bold and flowery:${prompt}
  14074: “When the light deity clashed with the dark, rent in twain were the heavens, and devastated was the earth by a storm beyond comprehension.”${prompt}
  14075: |-
    I must admit to feeling a degree of shock,
    for this simple passage described the arrival of Ragnarok...${prompt}
  14076: |-
    Ragnarok...
    The northern legend that tells of the twilight of the gods?
    You mean to tell us that this supernova was in fact the aftermath of a battle between divinities?${prompt}
  14077: |-
    Oh, so close to the mark.
    Shall I endeavor to bring you out of the dark?${prompt}
  14078: This is my hypothesis based on the facts at hand...${prompt}
  14079: The old Empire of Aht Urhgan launched their iron colossus, imbued with the spirit of the light deity, high into the air, and attempted to dominate the entire land.${prompt}
  14080: |-
    The nation that revered a rival deity was unsurprisingly not amused.
    They sent up their Dark Rider born from sacrifice and with utter darkness infused.${prompt}
  14081: A fierce battle raged in the skies, and eventually both combatants fell to earth--the giant in pieces, and the rider with grave wounds to his material form.${prompt}
  14082: But this titanic struggle had blasted the land into ruin, and left a void in the heavens that spawned a cataclysmic storm...${prompt}
  14083: An apocalypse...${prompt}
  14084: |-
    What a ridiculous story.
    How could an iron colossus be made to fly?${prompt}
  14085: And what does this have to do with the name of the Gordeus?${prompt}
  14086: |-
    We Tarutaru have always been notoriously fussy about our cuisine.
    The name was probably heard from a trader in foreign goods, is what I mean.${prompt}
  14087: The name of the colossus's heart, given to a star...${prompt}
  14088: We have let ourselves be distracted by the candescences. The Gordeus should have been our true concern.${prompt}
  14089: |-
    We can only hope that the Grand Vizier has failed to notice the true value of the treasure under his nose.
    We must hurry to bring this matter to a close.${prompt}
  14090: |-
    Naji reporting in!
    I've brought ${name-player} back with me!${prompt}

    ${name-player}, we are grateful you could come.
    Your insight will be invaluable.${prompt}
  14094: Please, describe to us your impressions of the events unfolding in the Empire...${prompt}
  14095: Thanks to your talents, gaining the program data we needed was far less complicated than expected.${prompt}
  14096: But the Empress appears to have only a tentative hold on consciousness...${prompt}
  14097: It is nothing to be concerned about. When reading someone's memories with my altered...perspective...it occasionally releases images and thoughts sealed deep within the mind.${prompt}
  14098: |-
    This state of regression is only temporary.
    She will recover in time...${prompt}

  14104: |-
    Congratulations are in order!
    You will soon hold the most awe-inspiring weapon in Urhguum in the palm of your hand--the power of light.${prompt}
  14105: Father...!?${prompt}
  14106: But the power of Alexander is a double-edged sword.${prompt}
  14107: Mother!${prompt}
  14108: |-
    The infinite energy of a star...
    The legends--not to mention the ruins--speak eloquently of the destruction that will befall should you make a single misstep.${prompt}
  14109: |-
    It is not too late.
    If you possess a shred of compassion, you will halt the program immediately.
    We hope you choose the wiser course...${prompt}
  14110: |-
    Hmph...a cunning trick, Nashmeira.
    Defiant until the last.${prompt}

    Then, a war it shall be.
    Preparations must be made with all urgency.${prompt}

    Ohohoho.
    Our amphibious cardian advance units were already given the order to deploy.
    They lay hidden in the Wajaom Woodlands, primed and waiting to destroy.${prompt}

    Already deployed...?
    Was the decision of this council a forgone conclusion?${prompt}
  14129: '...${prompt}'
  14130: N-now hold on a minute!${prompt}
  14131: '!!!${prompt}'
  14132: From what I could gather from ${name-player}'s explanation, this Luzaf character wants to prevent Ragnarok as much as we do.${prompt}
  14133: Naji! Remember your station!${prompt}
  14134: And the Empress is of the same mind...isn't that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14135: The way I see it, there's no need to go head-to-head with the Empire's forces.${prompt}
  14136: If we can spirit Luzaf out of their clutches, then we can at least put a stop to this Ragnarok business.${prompt}
  14137: We might even get a chance to restore authority to the Empress while we're at it.${prompt}
  14138: Ayame, ${name-player}...we've all been to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  14139: We've seen the lives, the smiles, the tears of her people...${prompt}
  14140: |-
    The citizens of the Empire are as much the children of Altana as we are.
    War should be considered only after every other avenue has been exhausted.${prompt}
  14141: Naji...${prompt}
  14142: |-
    Ohohohohoho.
    A voice of reason from Bastok, the nation of mines and gloom?${prompt}
  14143: And you would plan this strategy yourself, I assume?${prompt}
  14144: |-
    What? Um, y-yes!
    Of course!${prompt}
  14145: |-
    Wonderful. I admire your ambition.
    I shall offer the latest model of cardian to escort you on this mission.${prompt}
  14146: Thank you, Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  14147: |-
    Very well.
    Then you shall have two veteran knights to accompany you as well.${prompt}
  14148: And from Jeuno, you will have the use of our fastest airship, with an ace pilot at the wheel.${prompt}
  14149: Prince Trion, Sir Wolfgang...${prompt}
  14150: |-
    It appears I have no choice.
    I will inform the president of this operation myself.${prompt}

  14161: Well, then, I guess I'll have to make do without ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...${prompt}
  14162: |-
    No, Naji.
    Without ${name-player}, I will not allow this reckless plan to go ahead.${prompt}

    Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!${prompt}
  14323: There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt}
  14324: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  14325: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt}

    There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  14327: |-
    Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  14328: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  14329: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  14330: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  14331: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  14332: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  14333: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  14334: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  14335: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}

  14404: |-
    “But what in Slumbering Samwell's shank does it do,” you ask?
    Consider yourself fortunate, for it's my policy to demystify before the customer buys.${prompt}
  14405: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let him ramble.
    Purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Learn how to use it.
    Discard abyssite.
    Leave.${prompt}
  14406: Ahem! Allow me to present you with a supposition.${prompt}
  14407: Lying in parallel to the world upon which we stand exists another dimension.${prompt}
  14408: |-
    “Abyssea” is its name--or at least, the name I've bestowed upon it.
    It is a world of boundless beauty, mystique, and riches unclaimed.${prompt}
  14409: |-
    Now, suppose this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is a key to accessing Abyssea.
    Were you in possession of one, your curiosity would get the better of you, yes?${prompt}
  14410: Strictly speaking, this object does not grant entry into Abyssea itself.${prompt}
  14411: It does, however, make it possible to interact with beings from that plane of existence--“Abysseans,” I call them.${prompt}
  14412: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} serves to detect Abysseans that wander the gulf between worlds.
    How those hapless creatures--I refer to them as “Voidwalkers”--found their way there, mind you, is another subject entirely.${prompt}
  14413: 'Having drifted to this realm from the world yonder, much like the Voidwalkers themselves, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the presence of these creatures and will react--vibrate and emit light--when they draw near.${prompt}'
  14414: The closer your distance to a Voidwalker, the stronger the reaction becomes, until the creature is forcibly wrested into this dimension.${prompt}
  14415: 'Repeated contact with Abysseans will cause the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to take on different hues, allowing it to respond to creatures belonging to the higher echelons of Voidwalkers.${prompt}'
  14416: |-
    Be forewarned! Abysseans are among the most foul-tempered, unpredictable creatures.
    You would do well to steel yourself for a trying encounter prior to making contact.${prompt}
  14417: I trust your many adventures have made you familiar with those ghastly statues scattered across the land called cavernous maws.${prompt}
  14418: My observations have revealed that the concentration of Voidwalkers is greatest in locations where these statues are found.${prompt}
  14419: As yet, I have no plausible explanations for this phenomenon, but you needn't concern yourself with such details.${prompt}
  14420: Yours, my friend, is a dilemma infinitely simpler in nature.${prompt}
  14421: All this far-fetched talk of Abyssea, Abysseans, and Voidwalkers...${prompt}
  14422: I'm fully aware of the fantastical nature of my tale, and do not think poorly of those inclined to skepticism.${prompt}
  14423: |-
    Yet I feel no need to vouch further for the authenticity of my claims.
    Such is my confidence that the truth speaks for itself.${prompt}
  14424: |-
    Now then. A great new world has presented itself before you.
    The question is, will you embrace this opportunity, or let it pass you by?${prompt}
  14425: |-
    As Abysseans cross from one realm to another, so too does gil pass from one individual to the next.
    In my mind, it is only fitting that gil is that which grants you the key to Abyssea.${prompt}
  14426: |-
    My tales have piqued your interest, have they?
    As I have mentioned prior, the price is ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
  14427: |-
    Hand over ${number: 0} gil?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye.
    Nay.${prompt}
  14428: |-
    No? The sum I ask is by no means prohibitive.
    I'll be waiting here, should you ever change your mind.${prompt}
  14429: |-
    I thank you for your custom.
    Here is your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  14430: 'As a service for all customers, upon request I will take your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands and dispose of it in your stead.${prompt}'
  14431: |-
    The ability to meddle with inter-dimensional matter can be considered a great power, with which comes great responsibility.
    Indeed there have been those who found the burden beyond their capacity to cope.${prompt}
  14432: It seems you are short on gil. Yet I cannot grant concessions, lest access to otherworldly realms lose its true value.${prompt}
  14433: 'I see you''ve developed a taste for ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. Yet I fear I cannot furnish you further, for one alone is sufficient to invite misfortune upon the heedless.${prompt}'
  14434: |-
    You wish to know how to use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    There is no trick to it. Allow me to demonstrate.${prompt}
  14435: |-
    While in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, simply assume a resting pose.
    I'm given to understand it is second nature to all adventurers.${prompt}
  14436: 'Doing so will cause your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to react. Pertinent information can be gleaned by observing the magnitude of its vibration and the manner of light emitted.${prompt}'
  14437: Should neither reaction occur, take it to mean that no Voidwalkers roam the area.${prompt}
  14438: Should it vibrate softly but emit no light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers have recently passed through and may soon return.${prompt}
  14439: Should it vibrate softly and emit a gentle light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers presently roam the area.${prompt}
  14440: |-
    Now, pay particular attention to what I'm about to explain.
    The reaction of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will change once a predetermined distance from a Voidwalker has been closed.${prompt}
  14441: |-
    From that point onwards, the magnitude of the vibration corresponds directly to the creature's strength.
    Based on this knowledge, it is your decision whether to pursue it further.${prompt}
  14442: The gentle glow of light, on the other hand, will intensify to become a radiant beam pointing in the direction of the creature.${prompt}
  14443: Following that beam to its end will cause the heretofore invisible Voidwalker to cross fully over into this world and take form.${prompt}
  14444: This precise moment of encounter with an Abyssean, I have dubbed “contact.”${prompt}
  14445: Not only are Abysseans known to be temperamental and unpredictable; there are those that demonstrate a degree of cunning and guile far beyond that seen in this world.${prompt}
  14446: Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  14447: 'For as surely as the beam of light emitted by the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} guides you to a Voidwalker, so too does it guide the Voidwalker to you. Be ever mindful of this fact.${prompt}'
  14448: Know also that not one, but numerous Voidwalkers may roam the land at any given time, and the readings indicate only the creature nearest you.${prompt}
  14449: You would do well to check the readings regularly, as a sudden change in the light's direction could mean a different Voidwalker has wandered your way.${prompt}
  14450: Voidwalkers will only reveal their true form at the point of contact, and seeking one only to be met with another is a scenario all adventurers want to avoid.${prompt}
  14451: |-
    But surely, you grow weary of my ramblings.
    I for one believe this is something best learned through doing.${prompt}
  14452: |-
    Has the burden of this responsibility proven too heavy to bear?
    Very well, I will take it off your hands and see to its disposal.${prompt}

    Why, it's the perfect way to share your profound passion for your chosen profession with the world!${prompt}

    So here's the deal. In order to learn a gesture from me, you'll first need to achieve a certain level of proficiency in your chosen job.

    Capacity-challenged adventurers, come one, come all, kupo!

    Rest assured that you will not depart disappointed, my friend.${prompt}
  14745: Feast your eyes on the stylish, fashionable Mog Sack!${prompt}
  14746: |-
    Why, it's the perfect union of form and function!
    Who could ask for more, kupo?${prompt}
  14747: |-
    What's more, its carrying capacity can be customized to meet its owner's needs.
    Greedaloxes and Grand Greedaloxes haven't seen anything like this!${prompt}
  14748: |-
    And it can be yours--yes, yours!--for the low, low price of only ${number: 1} gil!

    That's right, we at the MHMU don't care how far into debt we go this time!

  14753: |-
    We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo?

    I'm afraid your mog sack has already been enlarged to its limits.
    We wouldn't want to have any...fabric malfunctions, would we, kupo?${prompt}

    I'm afraid your mog sack has reached its limits.
    Your gobbiebag, on the other hand, looks like it could still be tailored up in the right hands.${prompt}
  14762: The mog sack is a marvel of modern moogle craftsmanship, imbued with moogle magic that allows its capacity to be increased proportional to the size of your gobbiebag!${prompt}
  14763: |-
    How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery!
    Kupohohoho!${prompt}

    <Ahem>... Yes, yes.
    At any rate, the plight you suffer is not atypical of adventurers like yourself, kupo.${prompt}

    ${name-player} here has already reaped the fruits of my ingenuity. Is that not right, ${name-player}?${prompt}

  14907: |-
    I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?
    It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt}
  14908: |-
    The resistance greatly values your contributions.
    Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt}
  14909: |-
    I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.
    Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt}
  14910: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  14911: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  14912: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  14913: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  14914: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  14915: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  14916: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  14917: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  14918: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  14919: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}
  14920: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.
    Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  14921: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt}

  15037: |-
    And so I have no choice but to employ capable adventurers such as yourself to keep the fiends at bay.
    As inefficient as it may seem, it is the best course of action available to us under these conditions.${prompt}
  15038: |-
    We are counting on your continued efforts, ${name-player}.
    In the meantime, take this for your service.
    May it serve you well.${prompt}
  15039: |-
    Admirable work in Qufim, soldier. I did not think you had it in you.
    His Excellency has expressed great satisfaction in your accomplishments as well.${prompt}
  15040: |-
    And yet we cannot afford to become complacent.
    For each fiend we dispatch, a more abominable monstrosity rises to take its place.${prompt}
  15041: |-
    We have recovered much useful data from your encounters with the Voidwalkers.
    Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.${prompt}
  15042: |-
    Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all.
    Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.${prompt}
  15043: Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.${prompt}
  15044: You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.${prompt}
  15045: |-
    The Archduke himself trusts you greatly.
    That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.${prompt}
  15046: |-
    Take this for your efforts, and do not let up the fight.
    We will be watching you with great interest, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15047: Pssst! ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15048: |-
    Over here! This way, I say!
    It's me! Cait Sith, your feline friend!${prompt}
  15049: Do forgive me for my appearance. Pardon my unfamiliar manifestation.${prompt}
  15050: You may think of it as sort of passing fancy. A cait's caprice.${prompt}
  15051: |-
    But there are more important matters a-paw.
    Matters that would best be discussed somewhere other than here, I fear.${prompt}
  15052: |-
    Let us rendezvous in the Pashhow Marshlands of the past. The age-old swamp.
    It's quite a trek, so take care and don't be late! Ta-ta, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15053: |-
    There ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is, kupo!
    Wherever have you been, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15054: |-
    Heh... ${name-player} goes where adventure calls.
    But you can always trust ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to show up when the time is right.${prompt}
  15055: |-
    Kupo-ho!
    ...So that's how it works.${prompt}
  15056: |-
    Well, look who's finally here.
    I was wondering how long you were going to keep me waitaruing.${prompt}
  15057: Hm? Why's that?${prompt}
  15058: |-
    Surely you haven't forgotten-wotten our contract, ${name-player}.
    I intend to keep my end of the bargain, so you'd bettaru live up to yours.${prompt}
  15059: 'Your mission, whether or not you choose to acceptaru it: amass ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] and return here to me.${prompt}'
  15060: |-
    Why, you say?
    Oh, just a little experiment of sorts.${prompt}
  15061: I've devised a method by which the power of merit points may be channel-wanneled to rip and wrench open the reserves of chakra that lie dormant within you.${prompt}
  15062: |-
    Getting excitarued yet? 'Cause I sure am.
    So what are you waiting for? ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and make it snappy-wappy.${prompt}
  15063: |-
    Rip and wrench?
    That sounds awfully...violent, kupo.${prompt}
  15064: |-
    Indeed...
    And yet, it's a most accurate description. Heh heh...${prompt}
  15065: Kupopo?${prompt}
  15066: |-
    Hear me out, ${name-player}.
    Be strong of body and mind, and there is no limit to the powers you can master.${prompt}
  15067: You didn't sign that contract for the all-you-can-eat rarab tails, now, did you?${prompt}
  15068: |-
    Believe in yourself, and go forward, ${name-player}.
    Your destiny awaits.${prompt}
  15069: |-
    Back so soon?
    That's our ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15070: Heh. Never met a challenge ye didn't like, eh?${prompt}
  15071: |-
    Wow, you completed that task in a jiffy-wiffy.
    Looks like I made the right choice signing a contract with you.${prompt}
  15072: |-
    Well then, let's get this show on the road.
    Don't worry, ${name-player}--it'll be over in two shakes of a rarab's tail.${prompt}
  15073: |-
    Kupopo?
    Is it prudent to proceed with the process so promptly?${prompt}
  15074: |-
    Under normal circumstances, we'd take things a bit more slowly-wowly.
    But hey, ${name-player} and I are people in demand. Aren't we, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15075: When I say go, we're going to condense all the merit power you've accumulated into one pulsating mass of energy, then proceed to rippy-wip that straight out from the core of your soul.${prompt}
  15076: |-
    Stay focused, and try not to blink.
    It might kill you.${prompt}
  15077: K-kupo!?${prompt}
  15078: '...${prompt}'
  15079: And that should do it!${prompt}
  15080: Did we kill ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt}
  15081: Kupo...oh!?${prompt}
  15082: I've noted this numerous times before, but you really have a remarkably resilient body, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15083: It's all the trainin' ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] put in with yours truly.${prompt}
  15084: |-
    Stand tall and proud...er, if you can still stand.
    The legendary power of the bushin is yours.${prompt}
  15085: Kupo!? That's how you pass along the power of the bushin!?${prompt}
  15086: It looked like you were just trying to blast poor ${name-player} into smithereens!${prompt}
  15087: More or less. It's the shock of the blastaru combined with the amassed power of ${name-player}'s merit points that triggers the reaction.${prompt}
  15088: By focusing all of those energies into one pulsating mass and ripping it out from within, we've opened up a veritable font of chakra inside ${name-player}'s body.${prompt}
  15089: A font...of chakra, kupo?${prompt}
  15090: They say such stores of power exist inside us all, yet most will train a lifetime without ever learnin' how to tap into 'em...${prompt}
  15091: |-
    You laid the foundation with your physical enhancements experiments, my fluttery, furry friend.
    I simply-wimply applied the finishing touches.${prompt}
  15092: |-
    But let's get to the heart of the mattaru, ${name-player}.
    What I've bestowed upon you today is but a foundation for powers that may yet be mastered.${prompt}
  15093: |-
    Listen, and listen well.
    Look within and take stock of your merits, and you'll see a new path open to you.${prompt}
  15094: |-
    Using the energies within you, I've burned into your soul the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.${prompt}
  15095: |-
    For this is not the end of your training, but only the beginning.
    Or were you just bluffing-wuffing when you said you wanted to take me on? Haha!${prompt}
  15096: |-
    And with that, I'd best be off.
    I am a man in demand, after all.${prompt}
  15097: Before that, though, I really could use a good meal and a...<yawn>...nap.${prompt}
  15098: A man in demand? More like a lazy louse, kupo.${prompt}
  15099: |-
    As enigmatic as our friend is, the realm may never know.
    Heh heh...${prompt}
  15100: |-
    Let up not in your training, ${name-player}. The path to true martial mastery lies before you.
    Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some rarab tails t'--er, I mean, my trainin' to get back to.${prompt}
  15101: You learned the secret technique of the bushin!${prompt}
  15102: |-
    You've come. Splendid.
    We regret having to summon you again so soon after your last tour of duty, but the Duchy has need of your services again.${prompt}
  15103: Our research team has confirmed the presence of new rifts in the greater three nations area.${prompt}
  15104: |-
    Under normal circumstances, the defense effort would fall under the jurisdiction of the local governments.
    This time, however, I fear the circumstances are far from normal.${prompt}
  15105: |-
    I will be frank with you, ${name-player}.
    The strength of the enemy is beyond anything we've faced thus far.${prompt}
  15106: |-
    Here is your badge of authorization.
    Take it and report to the Voidwatch officers stationed afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15107: |-
    Once again, we have recruited other promising adventurers to our cause.
    You may find it in your best interests to join up with them before taking on the enemy.
    We're counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15108: |-
    I trust you've recovered from your last tour of duty.
    If not, so be it. Full strength or no, the Duchy requires your service.${prompt}
  15109: Ducal researchers have alerted us to the presence of newly formed planar rifts in the vicinity of the three kingdoms.${prompt}
  15110: |-
    Under normal circumstances we would let the nations fend for themselves.
    We fear that this time, however, their limited resources and manpower will do little to stem the tide of this formidable enemy.${prompt}
  15111: |-
    Hence, we turn to you.
    Take this badge of authorization and present it to our officers afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15112: |-
    We have recruited others for the effort as well.
    Join forces with them if you wish, or fight alone.
    Just remember: the success of the operation is more important than the life of any single soldier, including yours.${prompt}
  15113: As we trust you are already aware...${prompt}
  15114: |-
    Direct supervision of the Voidwatch operation will be conducted by our officers dispatched to the three nations.
    You are to follow their instructions to the letter.${prompt}
  15115: ${name-player}. Once again you prove that the Duchy's faith in you was not misplaced.${prompt}
  15116: |-
    You are an asset to the Voidwatch.
    And yet the data we have recovered from your efforts yields as many questions as answers.${prompt}
  15117: |-
    The Voidwalker menace has been quieted for now.
    Yet we would be fools to believe that our foe will remain silent for long.${prompt}
  15118: Until we can identify and eliminate the source of the threat, we have no recourse but to call upon you again.${prompt}
  15119: |-
    In the meantime, take this as recompense for your efforts.
    I trust you shall put it to good use.${prompt}
  15120: What is the meaning of this interruption!?${prompt}
  15121: |-
    My pardons. Your Excellency, we've received dire news from the field.
    Two new rifts have been confirmed at previously unbreached locations...${prompt}
  15122: Hmph. Two, you say?${prompt}
  15123: Aye. One buried in the sands of the Valkurm Dunes, the other on Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  15124: Your Excellency...?${prompt}
  15125: |-
    This adventurer is a veteran Voidwatcher.
    I would have ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] hear your findings as well.${prompt}
  15126: |-
    At present, it responds to neither ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} nor ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    We are unable to gauge the potential danger of any Voidwalkers that may lie beyond.${prompt}
  15127: |-
    Intriguing.
    So the portal between dimensions is not yet fully formed...${prompt}
  15128: |-
    It is only a matter of time before the monsters spring forth.
    Let up your watch not for a second, and send word the moment you detect anything amiss.${prompt}
  15129: Sir! Yes, sir!${prompt}
  15130: It would seem your next mission will begin sooner rather than later, soldier.${prompt}
  15131: |-
    We will authorize you for participation at such time as it is necessary.
    In the meantime, I suggest you rest up and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.${prompt}
  15132: |-
    Too much remains unknown about these rifts.
    I grow impatient with our researchers and their incessant pleas for more time.${prompt}
  15133: |-
    I concur. The situation threatens to spiral out of control.
    We cannot afford to play the dispassionate observer for much longer.${prompt}
  15134: ${name-player} has proved a most useful...resource...in the pursuit of our goals.${prompt}
  15135: |-
    And yet there are limits to what one adventurer--or even an army of them--can do.
    It seems that we have no choice but to get involved more...directly.${prompt}
  15136: '...Yes, Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  15137: |-
    It would seem the Voidwatch effort in the three nations was a success.
    Once again, you prove yourself not entirely useless.${prompt}
  15138: |-
    The Archduke will be pleased.
    And yet the Voidwalker menace persists.${prompt}
  15139: The data we have recovered from your latest mission is...not promising.${prompt}
  15140: |-
    More details? I think you forget your station, soldier.
    You will get the information you are authorized to receive, and no more.${prompt}
  15141: |-
    Let it suffice to say that we will have need of your services again.
    Stay alive, and do not stray too far.${prompt}
  15142: |-
    I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice.
    Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  15143: Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.${prompt}
  15144: 'It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.${prompt}'
  15145: While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase “shrouded in mystery” does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.${prompt}
  15146: We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vana'diel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.${prompt}
  15147: Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.${prompt}
  15148: Furthermore...${prompt}
  15149: Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.${prompt}
  15150: Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.${prompt}
  15151: No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.${prompt}
  15152: To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.${prompt}
  15153: |-
    Archduke Kam'lanaut expects great things of you as well.
    It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.${prompt}
  15154: Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.${prompt}
  15155: Hmm...something's not right here.${prompt}
  15156: I would have expected their reports to have arrived by now...${prompt}
  15157: Who's this then? An adventurer, I gather?${prompt}
  15158: |-
    Well? Are you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    No...${prompt}
  15159: Please forgive my intrusion.${prompt}
  15160: I wish you well in all your endeavors.${prompt}
  15161: To find an adventurer such as yourself so quickly! Fortune indeed shines upon me this day!${prompt}
  15162: But where are my manners? I have not yet introduced myself. I am Anastase, an emissary sent from the Sacred City of Adoulin.${prompt}
  15163: But of course, you need not say anything. I know why you have sought me out.${prompt}
  15164: You are here to assist me in surveying the geomagnetic founts, yes?${prompt}
  15165: |-
    Lend your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall.
    Not interested.
    Hear more.${prompt}
  15166: I see. I must admit to feeling a twinge of disappointment, but I understand.${prompt}
  15167: My stay here will be a long one, so if you have a change of heart, please come and see me again.${prompt}
  15168: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me study the geomagnetic founts?${prompt}
  15169: I come from the Sacred City of Adoulin, an island that lies far to the west, beyond the great Sea of Zafmlug.${prompt}
  15170: Further still beyond the island is the continent of Ulbuka, where a pristine expanse of nature sits unsullied by mortal hands.${prompt}
  15171: Tales of men and women from the Middle Lands who cannot resist the clarion call of a good deed left undone have stretched across the sea and reached my ears. Hearing these tales prompted me to make the arduous journey here.${prompt}
  15172: For you see, I desire your assistance in our quest to pioneer the undeveloped lands of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  15173: I had hoped to secure transport in advance for those interested in cooperating with this enterprise.${prompt}
  15174: But executing a plan is never a simple affair. Air and sea vessels are indeed available, but unsustainable in the long term due to the staggering distance between the two continents.${prompt}
  15175: Yet one possibility exists. In our beloved city, devices called “waypoints” allow the user to instantaneously move from one location to another.${prompt}
  15176: However, I am not certain whether the ley lines to which these waypoints are attuned traverse the oceans to the Middle Lands. My first task, therefore, is to find locations suitable for such travel.${prompt}
  15177: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are needed to use our waypoints, but their efficacy is dependent on recording the energies of certain geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15178: 'As part of this mission, I have brought with me several such ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. What I would ask of you is that you take one to these various founts and attune it to them.${prompt}'
  15179: Unfortunately, there is precious little time to collect this information.${prompt}
  15180: As I have previously mentioned, my fervent hope is that you will undertake this mission. The very fate of my homeland hangs in the balance.${prompt}
  15181: 'What I ask is that you use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to...oh?${prompt}'
  15182: 'You mean to tell me that you already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Then this will be all the easier!${prompt}'
  15183: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for the Middle Lands.${prompt}'
  15184: 'What I would ask of you is that you attune the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the aforementioned geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15185: If this survey is successful, then it will surely guarantee a prosperous trading partnership for our two homelands.${prompt}
  15186: I also imagine that there are many who would both honor and value your accomplishment.${prompt}
  15187: 'Your help is sincerely appreciated. Let me present you with this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15188: Attuning it to a geomagnetic fount will, if my calculations are correct, permit you to use the waypoints.${prompt}
  15189: I have already recorded the energies of the Ru'Lude Gardens fount. Please, travel throughout the world and proceed with your activities, and return to me when you have attuned it to another fount.${prompt}
  15190: Having never been to this land, I am not familiar with the exact locations, but our powers of divination have given us a certain cryptic insight.${prompt}
  15191: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me your prognostications.
    Tell me about these waypoints.
    Explain all this to me.
    None in particular.${prompt}
  15192: |-
    Which prognostication?
    ${selection-lines}
    None, actually.
    How do I record these founts?

    Quwi Orihbhe, a member of our mission, has seen...
    A geomagnetic fount located in ${choice: 0}[a port named after a young woman/a dwelling located in plains dotted by craggy outcroppings/a gushing oasis bursting forth from the surrounding dunes/a hard-to-find locale carved out of rock].${prompt}
  15194: I realize that these tips may confound more than confirm, but the features of this land are largely unbeknownst to me.${prompt}
  15195: Yet now that I think of it, Quwi did leave further clues behind...${prompt}
  15196: |-
    Pure white beaches...
    Clay...
    Disembowelment...${prompt}
  15197: |-
    A long-necked beast...
    A chef in search of meat from that beast...
    “The Old Lady”...${prompt}

    An island where sand stretches to the sky...${prompt}
  15199: |-
    Samurai and ninjas...
    Pirates...
    Contraband...${prompt}
  15200: Well, this certainly is quite perplexing. I only apologize that I cannot help you further.${prompt}
  15201: 'If you solve these riddles and find a geomagnetic fount, all you must do is hold up your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the location.${prompt}'
  15202: Quite a simple task, no?${prompt}
  15203: 'I shall be waiting here to collect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} when you have completed this endeavor.${prompt}'
  15204: Many years have I spent researching and analyzing these phenomena. Sensing any changes in the object I have given you is merely a trifle.${prompt}
  15205: To a layman's eyes, though, any deviations are impossible to detect.${prompt}
  15206: My hope is that, should these portals become fully active, even the uninitiated will be able to make such determinations with ease.${prompt}
  15207: I am sure you have noticed this mysterious device resting at my side. In Adoulin, we refer to items of its ilk as “waypoints.”${prompt}
  15208: 'These portals enable instantaneous transportation between two locations simply by holding up ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to them.${prompt}'
  15209: I am sure that now you understand the implications of my calling--if the geomagnetic founts are as strong as our research implies, then the waypoints should function here, as well.${prompt}
  15210: As we record information about the founts, we should be able to warp between more locations.${prompt}
  15211: However, there is always a price to be paid for convenience. Warping consumes a tiny bit of energy extracted from certain types of crystals.${prompt}
  15212: 'This energy, which in my field''s parlance is referred to as “kinetic units,” is imbued in ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} when extracted from these crystals.${prompt}'
  15213: Kinetic units are consumed each time you warp, meaning that periodic imbuing is necessary for continued use of the waypoints.${prompt}
  15214: Ah yes, before I forget--other members of my expedition have already gone to survey these locations.${prompt}
  15215: Should you happen to cross paths with them, make sure to emphasize that I am still waiting for their reports.${prompt}
  15216: May Altana keep you safe in this quest.${prompt}
  15217: 'Hail, and good tidings. May I please take a look at your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15218: '...!${prompt}'
  15219: This...this is amazing!${prompt}
  15220: 'You have traveled to the ${number: 0} locations I have requested and recorded the data in the geomagnetic founts there!${prompt}'
  15221: Adventurers are truly as reliable as I was led to believe. All in a day's work, I suppose.${prompt}
  15222: You have my undying gratitude for your efforts. Allow me to present this to you as a mere token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  15223: As an aside, did you happen to meet with any of the other members of my expedition?${prompt}
  15224: Though a bit wet behind the ears, their skills and talents are unparalleled.${prompt}
  15225: Among their ranks are geomancers and rune fencers--a rare sight in the Middle Lands, to be sure.${prompt}
  15226: If you were to visit Adoulin, you may be able to find out about their secrets for yourself.${prompt}
  15227: Forgive my loose tongue. Some things should be found out for oneself.${prompt}
  15228: My efforts now are focused on obtaining information about any more geomagnetic founts that may exist. I may have more information for you at a later date.${prompt}
  15229: ${name-player}, my friend! It is good to see you again. With what may I assist you today?${prompt}

    Are you an initiate?
    ${selection-lines}

    Uh, what are you doing?${prompt}
  15514: No? Then perhaps I need to take a break. I thought I read your magical aura properly, but my endless hours of study must have taken their toll.${prompt}
  15515: Well, there was the one gentlewoman who claims to have called forth an alter ego all by herself.${prompt}
  15516: Could you imagine what this means for our research? We may be on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!${prompt}
  15517: Rumors say that intimate knowledge of the person she was trying to summon was sufficient to complete the ritual. So here I am, researching, trying to replicate her success with a historical figure.${prompt}
  15518: 'But it''s no good. Without the bonds, we just can''t do it! The closest we''ve come is to craft ciphers--magical parchments that concentrate energies from a third party into physical forms. But that''s the rub: it still requires those bonds in the first place.${prompt}'
  15519: But someday...someday...${prompt}

  15521: |-

    Yes, your aura...${wait-36: 1}
    I've done it again, haven't I? A thousand pardons. I asked if you were part of the Trust initiative, but you are so much more than that.${prompt}
  15523: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} as a gift from the institute. It''s a cipher crafted from the very process I spoke of earlier.${prompt}'
  15524: The emotions of separate individuals converted into magical energy. Extraordinary, wouldn't you agree? Calling forth an alter ego with the thoughts of a third party.${prompt}
  15525: It's all very experimental, so I make no promises as to the efficacy of such a scroll. It's all we can do to keep the energies from collapsing in on themselves.${prompt}
  15526: Unlike a traditional scroll, these ciphers cannot be recited by anyone with a passing level of literacy. They require the assistance of certain institute staff located in major cities throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  15527: Still, I promise the journey will be worth it...for you, and for us.${prompt}
  15528: Bonds cannot be severed like a hot knife cutting through Selbina butter. The key is whether or not the strengths of the bonds' creators are enough to survive transcription.${prompt}
  15529: If there's someone who you feel a strong connection with, what can it hurt to ask them for their cooperation? You'll never know until you try!${prompt}
  15530: Hello. Can I help you?${prompt}
  15531: 'Hm? You''re here about ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15532: I'm sorry you came all this way, but I've already been briefed on that particular topic.${prompt}
  15533: Wait just a moment. Ah, now I remember you. Yes, I've been looking for you ever since our last encounter. Now, I need you in the field to help with my research...${prompt}
  15534: Ah, forgive me. I was so excited to find the person I was looking for, I forgot to explain what it is I'm doing.${prompt}
  15535: I've heard from a colleague that my research into Trust magic has earned the recognition of an academic organization.${prompt}
  15536: They have even given me clearance to read their most confidential documents in pursuit of my research. Well, a portion of them at least.${prompt}
  15537: However, when comparing that information against what I had gathered, I came across some interesting discoveries.${prompt}
  15538: For example, I learned that you had defeated an unusual life-form considered to be the physical embodiment of the darkest parts of a person's soul.${prompt}
  15539: Then it struck me--a new line of thought in my Trust magic research.${prompt}
  15540: That's right. I'm researching the topic of a dark Trust magic!${prompt}
  15541: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dark Trust magic?
    I see where this is going.${prompt}
  15542: Huh? You mean you don't know?${prompt}
  15543: Oh you do, do you?${prompt}
  15544: Well, allow me to briefly explain things just in case.${prompt}
  15545: Currently, the Trust magic you use is based on light. It draws on positive forces such as trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  15546: On the other hand, Trust magic based on darkness draws upon negative forces to generate its magic, much like how that woman was able to accomplish what she did.${prompt}
  15547: Oh, I suppose I'm leaving out some rather important information. That is to say, an explanation of the negative aspects of mankind's darker side.${prompt}
  15548: I'm basically referring to things like apathy, arrogance, cowardice, envy, and rage. You know, the darkest parts of one's soul. I believe that everybody harbors these feelings, at least to a certain extent.${prompt}
  15549: In a sense, all of us are united by the darkness within our souls. Therefore, it only seems logical to infer that we have the necessary conditions to employ Trust magic from it.${prompt}
  15550: All that remains is to try and elevate the darkness within the alter ego's soul and somehow link up with it...a type of bond all its own.${prompt}
  15551: 'Although, even if we are unable to utilize the Trust magic, we have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at our disposal. Intimate knowledge of your quarry should enable you to form a bond with them.${prompt}'
  15552: Which brings me to my request. I'd like for you to test your mettle against those unique forces. However, it cannot be any regular fight. You must really get to know your opponent.${prompt}
  15553: I requested the A.M.A.N. to create a Records of Eminence objective for this purpose, so it should help you remain cognizant of your opponent during battle.${prompt}
  15554: Hm? You want to know how to fight this particular opponent again? I think you probably know more about that sort of thing than I do.${prompt}
  15555: You learn more about Trust magic, and I get further along in my research. That's what I call a “win-win.”${prompt}
  15556: I heard from my colleague that he obtained a rather unusual cipher. Perhaps you should see this through to its conclusion?${prompt}

  15687: Now then! Jamal likes to equate the darkness of alter egos to the root of all evil or some such nonsense, but as with most things, he could not be more wrong.${prompt}
  15688: These are just my thoughts on the issue, but...${prompt}
  15689: You see, unlike Jamal, I do not believe that Trust magic is something meant to be cast outwards from its user.${prompt}
  15690: No, Trust magic is designed to look within us. In other words...${prompt}
  15691: The alter egos take shape due to the power contained within a kind of unseen pipeline inside of us that conveys our feelings and thoughts to them.${prompt}
  15692: That got me thinking! If one could somehow boost the amount of those feelings and thoughts being sent...${prompt}
  15693: It could lead to the alter ego itself becoming even more powerful!${prompt}
  15694: Hm? What do you mean you don't understand? You really are quite dense, aren't you?${prompt}
  15695: Well, I am stuck with you, I guess, so you will need a few things if you are to help me with my research.${prompt}
  15696: First of all, you will need this special diamond.${prompt}
  15697: It is capable of detecting the feelings and thoughts you direct at the alter ego you are summoning.${prompt}
  15698: This diamond then stores them within its crystalline confines.${prompt}
  15699: Once it has gathered a certain amount of thoughts and feelings, it will change color.${prompt}
  15700: So basically, I need you to use your Trust magic until you see the diamond change color!${prompt}
  15701: To help you to that end, I have also prepared something else for you.${prompt}
  15702: I ordered the A.M.A.N. to provide you with a list of Records of Eminence objectives!${prompt}
  15703: There are three objectives for you to complete. You simply need to complete them all to collect what is necessary!${prompt}
  15704: Ah, that reminds me. No matter what, you must not lose this diamond.${prompt}
  15705: It is made from an extremely rare gemstone, so I forced my mother's jewelry shop to let me have it.${prompt}
  15706: It was originally a rather unusual diamond that changed color whenever it sensed a change in the surrounding temperature.${prompt}
  15707: I simply used a little magic to make some key improvements and recreate something from a legend I once heard in a faraway land!${prompt}
  15708: Now then, let us begin the experiment!${prompt}
  15709: Ah, there you are! I was expecting you much sooner. Hurry up and hand me the diamond already.${prompt}
  15710: Hmm... Very well done. You have collected just the right amount of thoughts and feelings. Now, for just a touch of magic...${prompt}
  15711: I-it's a staggering success! The thoughts have been imbued into the diamond!${prompt}
  15712: Listen carefully. You simply need to use this diamond as a catalyst when invoking your Trust magic.${prompt}
  15713: When you do, the thoughts sent to your alter ego when it manifests will be made even more powerful.${prompt}
  15714: That power will then be sent to the alter ego when you attempt to call upon it.${prompt}
  15715: As a result, the alter ego itself will also become stronger!${prompt}
  15716: However, there is one thing you need to be careful of.${prompt}
  15717: The more of these pipelines you use to call forth the alter egos, the weaker the effect of the catalyst will become.${prompt}
  15718: I can see that your feeble mind is not comprehending what I am saying. Let me see, how can I dumb this down so even you can understand it...${prompt}
  15719: If your party is made up of you and five alter egos, that means that five pipelines will be used, so each alter ego will only be slightly powered up.${prompt}
  15720: And if your party contains you and one other member, along with four alter egos, that means there would be four alter ego pipelines and each one will be a little stronger.${prompt}
  15721: Finally, if there are five in your party along with only one alter ego, that means there is also only one alter ego pipeline, so it will be made considerably stronger.${prompt}
  15722: Do you understand now? Yes? I am glad to hear it.${prompt}
  15723: Take note that the catalyst will not be effective unless you yourself are of considerable strength.${prompt}
  15724: You must be strong if you wish to extract the power from the catalyst.${prompt}

  16010: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt}
  16011: 'Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent''s is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt}'
  16012: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  16013: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  16014: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}
  16015: 'The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent''s,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt}'
  16016: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt}
  16017: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt}
  16018: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt}
  16019: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt}

  16021: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt}
  16022: You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt}
  16023: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}
  16024: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt}
  16025: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  16026: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  16027: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}
  16028: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt}

    That's the problem, you see. Her “payment” to him was a boiled egg.
    In fact, I believe it's one you're quite familiar with.${prompt}

  16127: |-
    Fortunately, the World Eater Egg he ate had deteriorated rather significantly.
    As such, it probably could've been much, much worse for him.${prompt}
  16128: You see, while he was awake, he was able to somehow contain the power that radiated from within him.${prompt}
  16129: But whenever he fell asleep, he transformed into that monster, which you saw for yourself.${prompt}
  16130: |-
    Heh heh heh.
    Although, thanks to your battle against him, the power of the egg seems to have diminished even further, for now at least.${prompt}
  16131: |-
    You can leave the matter to us.
    We'll see that the rest of the egg's power is absorbed and sealed away properly.${prompt}
  16132: The mysterious shadow that's been haunting this place each night shouldn't be a problem any longer.${prompt}

    Here, this is for your troubles.
    I have a feeling you'll be needing it before this is all over.${prompt}
  16134: |-
    I've got something from Shami and Shemo that they wanted me to give to you.
    Here you go.${prompt}
