  10045: Paradis éternel. La terre des dieux. Le rêve que nous, les Zilart, avons conservé pendant dix mille ans est sur le point de devenir réalité.${prompt}

    Arrrg, bienvenue à Norg.
    Je suis Gilgamesh, le chef de ces coquins. Ma fille m'a raconté votre histoire.${prompt}
  10099: J'ai eu des soupçons sur Jeuno depuis des années. C'est pourquoi j'avais demandé à Lion d'enquêter ces derniers mois.${prompt}
  10100: Mais sacré bleu ! Je n'avais aucune idée que l'Archiduc et son petit frère étaient des Zilarts.${prompt}
  10101: Cette civilisation ancienne a disparu il y a si longtemps, il n'y a aucun document à son sujet.${prompt}
  10102: Et qui sont ces cinq Guerriers du Cristal ?${prompt}
  10103: Si ce sont vraiment les Guerriers dont parle la légende...${prompt}
  10104: Cela signifie-t-il que le “fléau” dont chante la chanson... c'est nous ?${prompt}
  10105: Nous allons faire couler le sang des innocents ? Nous allons plonger le monde dans la peur et le désespoir ?${prompt}
  10106: Donc nous sommes le fléau que les Guerriers du Cristal sont venus chasser ?${prompt}
  10107: Je ne sais rien des Guerriers du Cristal ou des légendes anciennes, mais je sais que je ne vais pas rester là à attendre que ces Zilarts prennent le contrôle du monde.${prompt}
  10108: “Purifier le monde ?” “Début de la fin ?” Ça fait beaucoup de belles paroles.${prompt}
  10109: Mais voyons-les dire ça devant moi ! Je ne fuis aucun combat !${prompt}
  10110: Mais comment pouvons-nous stopper le plan de Kam'lanaut ?${prompt}
  10111: Nous nous dirigeons vers le Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}
  10112: Le Temple d'Uggalepih ?${prompt}
  10113: " \nBien que ce ne soit pas aussi ancien que Fei'Yin, je connais des ruines anciennes dans le Temple d'Uggalepih, au-delà de la Jungle de Yuhtunga.${prompt}"

  10117: Je ne savais pas quoi en penser à l'époque, mais je n'aurais jamais cru que ce serait quelque chose d'aussi important.${prompt}
  10118: Je suis sûr que cette vieille dame doit savoir ce qui se passe. ${name-player}, je veux que vous voyagiez jusqu'au Temple d'Uggalepih et que vous la trouviez.${prompt}

  10127: Non, Lion. J'ai un autre travail pour toi.${prompt}
  10128: Quoi ?${prompt}
  10129: Lion, j'apprécie tes paroles, mais laisse-moi d'abord recueillir des informations autour de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10130: Savoir simplement que Kam'lanaut prépare quelque chose de mauvais est un bon début. Si j'apprends quelque chose de nouveau, tu seras le premier au courant.${prompt}

  10136: Eald'narche a aussi dit que seuls ceux qui ont été bénis par la lumière et dont le pouvoir a été accepté par le cristal peuvent passer à travers la porte.${prompt}

  10139: Ro'Maeve ? Hmmm...${prompt}
  10140: À l'extrémité nord de Mindartia se trouve une région sauvage et indomptée appelée le Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah. Dans cette région se trouvent des ruines antiques.${prompt}
  10141: Je me souviens que ces ruines étaient appelées Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  10142: Cependant, ces ruines, également connues sous le nom de Temple de la Désolation, ont longtemps été redoutées par beaucoup.${prompt}
  10143: Arrrg, un endroit effrayant que soit Zi'Tah. On ne sait jamais ce qui va surgir derrière toi.${prompt}

  10167: Tu dois te demander comment y aller, n'est-ce pas ? Tu trouveras la Jungle de Yhoator juste au-delà de la Jungle de Yuhtunga. Mais fais attention. Il y a beaucoup d'animaux sauvages qui rôdent dans cet endroit.${prompt}

  10179: Je m'appelle Jaucribaix, et je suis le forgeron ici à Norg. Je ne perds pas mon temps avec ces bêtises de synthèse de cristaux. Je forge tous mes katanas de manière traditionnelle.${prompt}
  10180: Notre leader, Gilgamesh, m'a demandé de lui forger un katana, mais je suis dans une certaine impasse.${prompt}
  10181: Un katana est une œuvre d'art. Je refuse de remplacer les méthodes traditionnelles de forgeage par la synthèse moderne. Cependant, mon approvisionnement en matériaux est actuellement épuisé.${prompt}
  10182: Si ces objets étaient faciles à obtenir, j'irais moi-même. Malheureusement, ce n'est pas le cas, et j'ai besoin de ton aide.${prompt}

    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10184: |-
    Je vois.
    Je m'excuse d'avoir pris ton précieux temps.${prompt}
  10185: Ah, as-tu reconsidéré mon offre ?${prompt}
  10186: 'Je te suis reconnaissant pour ton aide. Serais-tu si aimable de me rapporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} ?${prompt}'
  10187: 'Le ${item-singular: 0[2]} est pour la flamme qui alimente mon four, et le ${item-singular: 1[2]} est le matériau parfait pour fondre le fer. Les deux sont nécessaires pour forger une véritable lame de katana.${prompt}'
  10188: Pour savoir où tu peux trouver ces objets, demande à mes élèves.${prompt}
  10189: Dis-leur que je t'ai envoyé, et ils t'aideront avec tes préparatifs pour le voyage. Aussi, si tu rencontres des difficultés, tu pourras leur demander une aide supplémentaire. Cependant, je doute que tu en aies besoin.${prompt}
  10190: Pour savoir où tu peux trouver les objets que je souhaite que tu m'apportes, demande à mes élèves.${prompt}

  10192: Lorsque tu auras réuni les deux objets, rapporte-les-moi directement et je commencerai mon travail.${prompt}
  10193: Merveilleux. Voici les matériaux dont j'ai besoin. Je suis désolé, mais je dois me dépêcher ou Gilgamesh me coûtera la tête. Je te récompenserai pour tes services lorsque j'aurai terminé le katana.${prompt}
  10194: Combien de temps cela prendra, demandes-tu ? Une bonne lame nécessite au moins trois jours complets pour être terminée. Reviens alors. Ne t'inquiète pas. Je serai ici.${prompt}
  10195: Encore une fois, je m'excuse de ne pas avoir pu te donner ta récompense plus tôt.${prompt}
  10196: 'Mon travail n’est pas encore terminé. J’ai encore besoin de ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[heure/heure(s) supplémentaire(s)]. Il n’est pas sage de perdre ton temps à essayer de devancer le temps dans ce jeu que nous appelons la vie.${prompt}'
  10197: Le temps est comme une rivière qui coule—il ne peut être accéléré ou ralenti. Nous devons flotter au rythme qu'il a choisi.${prompt}
  10198: Ah, ${name-player}, tu es enfin revenu. Je commençais à m'inquiéter que tu aies oublié ta récompense.${prompt}
  10199: Maintenant, où ai-je mis cela...${prompt}
  10200: Arrrg, si ce n'est pas notre petit aide ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille] !${prompt}
  10201: Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  10202: Tu as fait un excellent travail en apportant les matériaux à mon pote, Jauc. Grâce à toi, j'ai maintenant une belle nouvelle lame.${prompt}
  10203: Écoute attentivement, ${name-player}. Dans un katana, l'âme de son créateur et l'âme de son utilisateur sont entrelacées.${prompt}
  10204: Cette nouvelle méthode de synthèse de cristaux que vous aventuriers utilisez est parfaite pour les manteaux et les flèches, mais elle ne peut pas reproduire les méthodes traditionnelles. Il faut connaître les essentiels derrière une lame si l'on veut jamais la maîtriser.${prompt}
  10205: C'est pourquoi nous faisons passer aux aventuriers comme toi des quêtes comme celle que tu viens de terminer. Nous voulons que tu connaisses la véritable signification de manier une lame comme celle-ci.${prompt}
  10206: Connaître la signification du pouvoir que tu détiens, et seulement alors tu trouveras le vrai pouvoir intérieur. C'est ce qu'on appelle le "bushido", la voie du samouraï.${prompt}
  10207: Tes aventures t'ont déjà formé pour devenir un samouraï. Il ne te reste plus qu'à faire le vœu de foi à cette lame. Ton pouvoir intérieur fera le reste.${prompt}
  10208: Débarrasse-toi de toutes les pensées inutiles et ressens le monde autour de toi. Fais de ton âme un miroir clair... un étang immobile. Projette-toi dans ta lame. C'est la compétence légendaire utilisée par les samouraïs--“Meikyo Shisui.”${prompt}
  10209: 'Prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}. Cette lame a été forgée pour toi. Fais le vœu de ta vie pour elle et elle ne te décevra pas.${prompt}'
  10210: |-
    Tu acceptes le ${item-singular: 0[2]} de Gilgamesh.
    Tu peux maintenant devenir un samouraï.${prompt}
  10211: Je souhaite te donner ta récompense, mais il semble que tu portes déjà trop de choses. Reviens quand tu auras plus de place dans ton sac.${prompt}
  10212: La technologie des cristaux a aidé Vana'diel à prospérer, mais au prix des méthodes traditionnelles, désormais perdues à jamais.${prompt}
  10213: Tout comme le vieux est remplacé par le nouveau, le monde est en constante évolution. Un jour, on pourrait ne plus pouvoir vivre uniquement avec une épée.${prompt}
  10214: 'Donc, tu as besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Je vois que le Maître Jaucribaix commence un nouveau projet. Laisse-moi te dire où trouver cet objet.${prompt}'
  10215: 'Tu ne trouveras pas juste un ${item-singular: 0[2]} traînant n’importe où. Forgé, un katana est quelque peu un rituel. Le forgeron concentre toute son énergie spirituelle dans la tâche. Ainsi, le ${item-singular: 0[2]} utilisé doit provenir d’un lieu spirituel également.${prompt}'
  10216: Au-delà des Montagnes Meriphataud se trouve une ancienne forêt connue sous le nom de Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah. Là-bas, tu trouveras un arbre qui se dresse depuis plus de mille ans.${prompt}
  10217: Seule une branche de cet arbre est adaptée à la flamme qui brûle dans le four du Maître Jaucribaix. Cependant, fais attention lors de ton voyage dans Zi'Tah, car c'est une terre pleine de mystères et de dangers.${prompt}
  10218: 'Tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Tu sauras quoi en faire quand tu arriveras à l’arbre. Fais attention à ne pas le perdre, car c’est un objet très rare.${prompt}'
  10219: 'Quoi ? Tu as besoin d’un autre ${item-singular: 1[2]} ? Et après que je t’ai dit combien c’était important ! Si tu veux que je t’en donne un autre, apporte-moi un ${item-singular: 2[2]} et deux ${item-plural: 3[2]}, et je réfléchirai à la question.${prompt}'

  10223: 'Que ferait un aventurier comme toi avec ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ? Oh, le Maître Jaucribaix t’a envoyé. Alors je suppose que je dois te donner ça.${prompt}'
  10224: 'À l’œil non averti, ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} peut sembler comme un simple morceau de ferraille, mais c’est en réalité un minerai rare venant de l’Extrême-Orient.${prompt}'
  10225: Il contient des métaux non trouvés sur Mindartia ou Quon. En le traitant de manière spéciale, il deviendra le matériau parfait pour fondre le fer dans le four du Maître.${prompt}

  10234: Tu n’as pas à t’inquiéter pour ta récompense. Le Maître Jaucribaix est un homme de parole. Il lui faut du temps pour terminer son travail.${prompt}
  10235: Tu dois être patient. Rien de bon ne peut être obtenu en précipitant les choses.${prompt}

    Heh-heh-heh...
    Tu t'es bien amusé avec les Tonberries, n'est-ce pas ? N'essaie pas de le nier. Je peux le dire rien qu'en te regardant.${prompt}
  10239: Je peux voir la haine des Tonberries pour toi. Écoute bien, mon ami, si tu veux survivre.${prompt}
  10240: Les petites créatures vertes sur cette île sont toutes connectées. Lorsque tu en tues une, les autres autour deviennent plus fortes. C'est leur haine pour toi qui les pousse.${prompt}

  10245: Autrefois, quand j'étais encore jeune et que je ne connaissais pas la haine—la rancœur—des Tonberries, j'en ai tué quelques-uns...comme toi.${prompt}
  10246: Puis, un jour, lorsque moi et mes compagnons pillions un ancien temple, j'ai rencontré un vieux Tonberry qui comprenait les mots des hommes.${prompt}
  10247: C'est lui qui m'a parlé de la haine des Tonberries, et que seul lui pouvait apaiser la rancœur qui m'était adressée.${prompt}
  10248: Mais ensuite, il m'a dit de lui remettre mes gil ! C'est un homme-bête pour toi !${prompt}
  10249: Alors je lui ai dit de me montrer des preuves avant que je lui donne des gil, et d'un coup de sa baguette, il m'a soulagé de la rancœur des Tonberries.${prompt}
  10250: Et ensuite, ai-je payé les gil ? Bien sûr que non ! Je l'ai frappé avec une "Attaque Sournoise" et j'ai volé sa clé pour la pièce. Ensuite, j'ai utilisé mon "Fuite" et j'étais parti comme le vent.${prompt}
  10251: Tu as compris ? Maintenant tu sais quoi faire. Voici la clé pour cette pièce.${prompt}
  10252: Ne te fais pas de fausses idées maintenant. Je t'ai seulement dit comment te débarrasser de la rancœur, pas de l'éliminer vraiment.${prompt}
  10253: Tu as la clé. Ce que tu en fais dépend de toi, mais fais attention si tu voyages autour de cet ancien temple.${prompt}
  10254: 'Eh bien, shivivi mes bois ! Ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu portes ! Je l’ai déjà vu !${prompt}'
  10255: Moi et mes compagnons ninjas ici à Norg avons travaillé jour et nuit, nuit et jour pour élaborer une nouvelle technique de ninjutsu. Mais nous l'avons rendue un peu trop compliquée...${prompt}

  10257: Tu l'as attrapée en pêchant ? Ça doit être l'œuvre des Sahagin poissonniers.${prompt}
  10258: Ils l'ont probablement jetée lorsqu'ils ont vu qu'elle était vierge. Ils ne savaient pas qu'il y avait un moyen spécial de rendre l'écriture visible.${prompt}
  10259: Que dit-elle ? Oh, j'ai oublié ça il y a des années. Mais je me souviens comment la lire.${prompt}
  10260: 'Oui, c’était cette méthode qui nous empêchait d’utiliser le parchemin en premier lieu... Mais bon, prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} jusqu’à la source chaude sur le Mont Horlais.${prompt}'
  10261: Lorsque tu mets le parchemin dans l'eau, les lettres apparaîtront, et voilà ! Tu as terminé !${prompt}
  10262: Pourquoi aller jusqu'au Mont Horlais ? Eh bien, si c'était facile d'y aller, ce ne serait pas un parchemin super-spécial, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10263: La seule raison pour laquelle nous avons cessé de les fabriquer était que personne ne voulait marcher jusqu'à ces sources chaudes...${prompt}

  10271: Eh bien, j'ai besoin que tu ailles chercher quelque chose dans leur coffre-fort caché. Ce n'est pas trop difficile, non ? Je veux dire, c'est une question de vie ou de mort ! Vie ou mort !${prompt}
  10272: Avant que les Sahagin ne prennent le contrôle, les pirates ici utilisaient la grotte comme zone de stockage. Pour protéger leur trésor des voleurs...et d'eux-mêmes, ils ont construit de nombreuses portes cachées.${prompt}
  10273: Récemment, les Sahagin ont ajouté des astuces et des pièges à ces portes, donc tu dois faire attention. Je ne pourrais pas le faire moi-même, mais toi ? Tu peux le faire ! Je sais que tu peux !${prompt}
  10274: D'après ce que j'ai entendu, le coffre-fort est pas si profond dans la grotte. Tout ce que tu as à faire est d'y descendre et de me ramener quelque chose—n'importe quoi ! Tu ne vas pas me lâcher, n'est-ce pas ? N'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

  10338: Mais une fois que tu te retrouves en mer ouverte... là, c'est notre territoire. Si nous repérons ton navire, il n'y a pas d'échappatoire. Nous pouvons être amis aujourd'hui, mais qui sait pour demain ?${prompt}
  10339: Bonjour, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]. Je m'appelle Rafid, mais c'est tout ce dont je me souviens de mon passé. Je suis arrivé ici il y a un an lorsque mon navire a été attaqué et que j'ai été sauvé par les pirates.${prompt}
  10340: La jungle qui couvre cette île est tellement grande, qu'elle a été divisée en deux--la Jungle de Yhoator et la Jungle de Yuhtunga.${prompt}
  10341: |-
    Je ne te recommande pas de voyager sans une carte, car tu pourrais te perdre, ou... être mangé. Souviens-toi, c'est une jungle là-dehors.
    Har har ! Tu comprends ?${prompt}
  10342: Nous traitons toutes sortes de marchandises que tu ne trouveras pas dans ton salon ordinaire. Non, non. Regarder ces choses me rappelle à quel point ce vaste monde est divers.${prompt}
  10343: Cette porte mène aux quartiers de notre leader, Gilgamesh. Il ne perd pas son temps avec des vers de terre comme toi, alors éloigne-toi de ma vue avant que je ne te fasse une visite personnelle du coffre de Davy Jones.${prompt}
  10344: Alors, tu es l'aventurier qu'ils appellent ${name-player}. J'ai entendu parler de toi de la part de notre leader. Tu peux passer, mais tu ferais bien de surveiller ta langue près de lui, ou tu nageras avec les poissons.${prompt}
  10345: Je suis le garde du corps ostentatoire de cet endroit. Tu fais le moindre faux pas, et je vais te gifler et te botter le derrière et te frapper et te battre et t'écraser et broyer tes os en poudre... et puis je te botterai encore.${prompt}
  10346: Suis les règles, je te laisserai en vie. Les enfreins, je te briserai.${prompt}
  10347: Gah-hah-hah ! Tu te demandes probablement ce que fait une maison de vente aux enchères dans ces fichues grottes. Nous sommes des pirates, que veux-tu ?${prompt}
  10348: |-
    Hé, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/dame] ! Par ici pour la sortie.
    Tu n'aurais pas un peu de gil en plus, par hasard ? Je fais des économies pour un nouveau perroquet.${prompt}
  10349: Hé, tu es un aventurier, non ? Passe par ce tunnel et tu arriveras à la maison de vente aux enchères. Et passe le bonjour aux moogles de ma part !${prompt}
  10350: Contrairement aux armures, la force d'une arme dépend uniquement de l'habileté de son propriétaire. Ce n'est pas parce qu'une lame est tranchante qu'on peut l'utiliser à son plein potentiel.${prompt}
  10351: Mais un aventurier comme toi aurait déjà su ça...${prompt}
  10352: Tu as déjà entendu parler de ces Tonberries qui agitent des lanternes et manient des couteaux ? Voyage jusqu'à l'ancien temple dans la Jungle de Yhoator et tu pourras en rencontrer de ces petites bêtes.${prompt}
  10353: 'Au plus profond de la Grotte du Serpent de Mer, les Sahagin ont construit une porte spéciale qui ne peut être ouverte qu’avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10354: 'Tu dis que tu veux ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} ? Ha ! Pourquoi ne pas essayer de demander à un des petits démons ?${prompt}'
  10355: Bienvenue à Norg. N'hésite pas à faire un tour de notre quartier général.${prompt}
  10356: Attends un peu, ${choice-player-gender}[pote/dame]. Personne, pas même les aventuriers, n'est autorisé à passer par ici.${prompt}
  10357: Heh-heh-heh. Régale-toi avec ces beautés. Tu ne trouveras pas de choses comme celles-ci ailleurs !${prompt}
  10358: S'il te plaît, reste et jette un œil. Tu pourrais trouver quelque chose que tu ne peux acheter qu'ici.${prompt}
  10359: Puis-je t'intéresser à une armure forgée dans les régions environnantes ?${prompt}
  10360: Des parchemins magiques ! Des parchemins magiques ! Nous avons des parchemins tout juste sortis des moutons !${prompt}
  10361: Salut ! Je peux livrer des colis à n'importe qui, n'importe où, à tout moment. Qu'en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  10362: Nous pouvons livrer des colis à n'importe quelle résidence dans Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10363: Bienvenue à la maison de vente aux enchères de Norg. Comment puis-je t'aider ?${prompt}
  10364: L'argent ne peut pas acheter l'amour, mais il peut te procurer des choses plutôt intéressantes. Comment puis-je t'aider ?${prompt}
  10365: Quoi, tu as un problème avec moi utilisant un baril ? Tu penses que je suis trop petit ? Ferme-la et dis-moi ce que tu veux.${prompt}
  10366: Qu-quoi... hein... oh ! Je n'ai pas beaucoup de gens qui me parlent, le comptable numéro “4”... Que puis-je faire pour toi ?${prompt}

  10381: Je suis un homme occupé, alors allons droit au but et passons aux affaires.${prompt}

  10383: Mais plutôt que de nous gêner mutuellement, je pensais qu'il pourrait y avoir un moyen de travailler ensemble. Ce que je veux que tu fasses, c'est me donner une idée de ce que vous aventuriers êtes capables de faire.${prompt}

  10391: Arrrg, si ce n'est la petite Ayaya. Tu deviens de plus en plus jolie chaque fois que je te vois.${prompt}
  10392: Gilgamesh. C'était bien quand tu m'appelais ainsi quand j'étais enfant, mais j'ai maintenant vingt ans.${prompt}
  10393: Alors, qu'est-ce qui t'amène ici ? Tu viens vérifier ton aventurier ?${prompt}
  10394: C'est l'une des raisons. Nous ne voudrions pas que tu t'empares de l'un des meilleurs de Bastok.${prompt}
  10395: Si je voulais m'emparer des meilleurs de Bastok, je m'emparerais du magnifique samouraï qui est devant moi. Alors, Ayaya ? Laisse ce travail ennuyeux et rejoins-nous !${prompt}
  10396: Nous serions ravis de t'avoir parmi nous. Tu aurais la chance de brandir ta lame quand tu le souhaites, et non quand ce président te le permet. Arrrg, qu'en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  10397: Bien que je sois flattée par ta proposition, je suis satisfaite de mon poste actuel et j'en suis fière.${prompt}
  10398: Je réalise que j'ai encore beaucoup à apprendre, mais en même temps je sens que je dois parcourir les routes que je juge nécessaires.${prompt}
  10399: Les épées et les mousquets ne sont pas faits pour être dégainés. C'est ce que m'ont appris mes parents, et ce sont les mots selon lesquels je souhaite vivre.${prompt}
  10400: Ayaya...${prompt}
  10401: J'ai apporté un document du président lui-même. Il concerne le traitement des aventuriers de Bastok, ainsi que les directives pour le commerce international.${prompt}
  10402: Tu pourrais vouloir lire les détails plus tard. Tu n'as pas besoin de donner une réponse maintenant. Cependant, je fais confiance à Norg pour prendre les mesures nécessaires.${prompt}
  10403: Arrrg, tu ne laisses pas beaucoup de place au choix, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10404: Je prends cela comme un compliment. J'ai appris tout ce dont j'avais besoin de savoir durant les années passées ici en formation.${prompt}
  10405: |-
    D'accord, d'accord. Retourne dire au vieux président que je lui passe le bonjour.
    Oh, et n'oublie pas de parler à Ryoma avant de partir. C'est le moins que tu puisses faire pour lui.${prompt}
  10406: Je suis désolée, mais cela devra attendre un autre jour... Cependant, peut-être que la prochaine fois je viendrai avec ma sœur cadette.${prompt}

  10410: Tu dois faire en sorte que les gens te fassent confiance. Une fois que les gens te feront confiance, tu commenceras à te faire un nom ici.${prompt}
  10411: ${name-player} ? J'ai peut-être entendu parler de quelqu'un qui porte ce nom, mais je rencontre beaucoup de gens dans mon travail.${prompt}
  10412: Ne te montre pas si contrarié, compagnon. Il faut beaucoup pour que les gens se souviennent de toi. Tout commence par la confiance !${prompt}
  10413: Tu es un aventurier, aide les gens. Petit à petit, ils commenceront à te faire confiance, mais ne t'attends pas à ce que ce soit immédiat.${prompt}
  10414: Attends une minute, je me souviens de toi... Mich... non... ${name-player}, c'est bien ça ?${prompt}
  10415: Tu vois, fais un peu de travail et les gens commencent à te reconnaître. Continue comme ça !${prompt}
  10416: Eh bien, si ce n'est pas ${name-player}. J'entends beaucoup ton nom ces derniers temps. Pourquoi, je me souviens quand tu n'étais qu'un misérable insecte.${prompt}
  10417: Grâce à mes conseils, tu te débrouilles très bien ici à Norg.${prompt}
  10418: Oh, ${name-player}. Je parlais justement de toi avec mes compagnons l'autre jour.${prompt}
  10419: Rien de mauvais, bien sûr. Ils avaient tous entendu parler de tes actes pour Norg. Certains commencent même à penser que peut-être tous les aventuriers ne sont pas si mauvais après tout.${prompt}
  10420: ${name-player} ! Il y a à peine une âme à Norg qui ne connaît pas ton fichu nom.${prompt}
  10421: Oh, désolé pour ça. Ma mère ne m'a jamais appris les manières. Je ferai attention à ma bouche... enfin, je ferai attention à partir de maintenant.${prompt}
  10422: ${name-player}...${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Mademoiselle] ${name-player}. Tu es devenu assez célèbre à Norg.${prompt}
  10423: Tous mes compagnons ne cessent de me demander si je peux les te présenter. Tu as vraiment fait parler de toi !${prompt}
  10424: Te voir me donne envie de quitter la vie en mer et de devenir aventurier !${prompt}
  10425: ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Mademoiselle] ${name-player} ! Il y a déjà des rumeurs sur ta dernière aventure qui circulent à Norg. Tu commences à devenir une sorte de légende ! ${prompt}
  10426: ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Seigneur] ${name-player} ! Après notre leader, Gilgamesh, tu es la personne la plus célèbre de tout Norg ! Certains de mes compagnons t'appellent même un héros !${prompt}

    Bonjour ?
    Tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ?
    Peut-être que tu peux nous aider.${prompt}
  10508: Permets-moi de me présenter, ainsi que mon compagnon. Nous venons du Rhinostery de Windurst.${prompt}
  10509: 'J’ai été engagé par le ministère pour accompagner ce chercheur à ${choice: 2}[l’Évier d’Ifrit/les Grottes de Quicksand/le Den de la Colère/Cape Teriggan/Fei’Yin/l’Arbre Boyahda] et l’aider dans ses recherches sur une série de cristaux géants.${prompt}'

  10511: |-
    Nous avons essayé maintes fois, mais je n'ai pas pu vaincre cette bête.
    Un autre chercheur au Rhinostery a compatit avec notre détresse et a développé un fourreau amélioré.${prompt}
  10512: |-
    Non non non non non !
    Ce dispositif farfelu ne nous fournira aucune donnée utile !${prompt}
  10513: |-
    Écoute, cerveau-muscle.
    La science n'est pas une question de victoire ou de perte, de vie ou de conflit, d'égal ou de Steven ! C'est un sujet plus délicat !${prompt}
  10514: Vois-tu ce avec quoi je dois composer ? Je ne sais pas combien de temps je pourrai travailler avec un tel pessimiste.${prompt}
  10515: |-
    C'est là que tu interviens.
    Je pensais laisser l'un d'entre vous aventuriers tester le nouveau fourreau et prouver à mon collègue qu'il est capable de fournir des données précieuses pour ses recherches.${prompt}
  10516: |-
    Non non non non non !
    Même s'ils utilisent ce spork de deuxième classe, il faudra un invocateur de premier ordre pour vaincre l'avatar primitif !${prompt}
  10517: |-
    Écoute.
    Le ${item-singular: 1[2]} sophistiqué ne te facilitera pas la tâche pour vaincre le monstre dans le cristal. Bien sûr, cela réduira la puissance de l'avatar primitif à environ ${number: 3}, mais cela te fera de même ! Et en plus, tu ne pourras invoquer que ce petit bonhomme bleu, Carbuncle !${prompt}
  10518: Et pour aggraver les choses, personne d'autre ne peut entrer dans le cristal avec toi ! Tu te battras en tête-à-tête, homme-à-homme, Taru-à-Taru !${prompt}

    ...
    Oui, mais monsieur... Le Rhinostery nous presse de produire des résultats. Si nous n'agissons pas rapidement...${prompt}

    Tu as un bon point...
    Je suppose qu'un tour avec un avatar primitif ne ferait pas de mal.${prompt}
  10521: Non, un tour ne pourrait pas faire de mal.${prompt}

    Eh bien, tu l'as demandé !
    Prends ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} et fais-le sonner près d'un de ces cristaux géants. L'avatar primordial ne sera pas content d'être réveillé, et tu devras affronter sa colère.${prompt}
  10525: 'Je suppose qu’étant donné que tu nous aides à tester ce nouveau fourreau, je peux utiliser ma magie pour te téléporter près du cristal géant à ${choice: 2}[l’Écu d’Ifrit/les Cavernes de Quicksand/le Repaire de la Colère/le Cap Teriggan/Fei’Yin/l’Arbre de Boyahda].

    Hmmm...
    Juste comme je le pensais. L'avatar primordial que tu as affronté avec ce fork démodé n'était rien d'autre qu'un faux. Rechercher de vrais avatars avec de vrais forks est la façon dont les vrais chercheurs font de vraies recherches dans le vrai monde !${prompt}

    Dans les semaines à venir, un rituel extrêmement important sera célébré. Pour compléter ce rituel, un « katana sacré » est nécessaire. J'ai besoin de ton aide pour rassembler les matériaux nécessaires à la fabrication de cette nouvelle lame.${prompt}
  10631: 'Le premier est ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Cela servira de base au katana sacré. Je suppose que le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu as utilisé dans ton entraînement repose encore quelque part dans ton Mog Safe.${prompt}'
  10632: 'Le deuxième objet dont j’ai besoin est ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. On ne trouve ces écailles que sur la bête qui vit au fond d’un étang cristallin dans le Sanctuaire de Zi’Tah.${prompt}'
  10633: 'Cependant, ce poisson ne peut pas être attrapé avec des méthodes traditionnelles. Tu dois l’attirer hors de sa cachette en utilisant ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, fabriqué par les Gobelins de cette forêt.${prompt}'
  10634: 'Fais attention lorsque tu combattras cette bête violente, car ce n’est pas un poisson ordinaire. Après l’avoir vaincu, récupère ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} et rapporte-les-moi.${prompt}'
  10635: Un long voyage t'attend. Je prie pour ton retour en toute sécurité.${prompt}
  10636: 'Écoute attentivement. Pour forger un nouveau katana sacré, j’ai besoin de deux objets, le premier étant le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu as utilisé dans ton entraînement.${prompt}'
  10637: Reviens ici lorsque tu auras obtenu les matériaux.${prompt}
  10638: Je vois que tu as réussi à obtenir les matériaux nécessaires à la forge du katana sacré. Grâce à ton travail acharné, la lame devrait être terminée pour le début du rituel.${prompt}
  10639: 'Ah oui, ta récompense. Laisse-moi te donner ce ${item-singular: 2[2]} en échange de ton ${item-singular: 0[2]}. C’est l’une de mes meilleures œuvres. Qu’il te guide dans ton voyage.${prompt}'
  10640: Comme je te l'ai dit précédemment, les matériaux que tu m'as apportés seront utilisés pour forger un katana sacré devant être utilisé dans un rituel important qui aura lieu dans quelques jours.${prompt}
  10641: Cependant, il reste encore beaucoup de préparatifs à faire. Ton aide pourrait de nouveau être requise.${prompt}
  10642: Que se passe-t-il ? Tu n'as pas l'air très bien...${prompt}
  10643: Je pense savoir ce qui te trouble. Tu te souviens de mon élève Ranemaud, n'est-ce pas ? Parle-lui, et il pourrait t'aider avec ton problème.${prompt}
  10644: 'C’est tout ce que je vais te dire. Après avoir obtenu ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, apporte-les-moi avec ton ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Je t’attendrai.${prompt}'
  10645: Eh bien, si ce n'est pas mon aventurier préféré. Comment se passe ton entraînement ? Je vois que tu es devenu un véritable samouraï.${prompt}
  10646: 'Mais la conversation n’est pas la raison pour laquelle tu es venu me voir, n’est-ce pas ? C’est dommage que ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} ait connu un sort si regrettable.${prompt}'
  10647: 'Cependant, ne t’inquiète pas. Le seul endroit où tu peux obtenir ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} est ici à Norg.${prompt}'
  10648: 'Comme un saumon revient à son lieu de naissance pour mourir, tous les ${item-plural: 0[2]} qui sont éliminés par leurs propriétaires reviennent ici à Norg. La lame que tu as éliminée n’est pas une exception.${prompt}'
  10649: 'Je ne sais pas quelles raisons tu avais en éliminant ton ${item-singular: 0[2]}, mais au moment où cette lame a quitté ta possession, elle est redevenue nôtre.${prompt}'
  10650: 'Je peux te la rendre si tu le souhaites, mais cela te coûtera. Paye-moi ${number: 7} gil, et je te rendrai ce que tu as laissé échapper.${prompt}'
  10651: 'Le destin qui attend ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} est beaucoup plus important que tu ne pourrais jamais l’imaginer. Prends-en soin cette fois-ci.${prompt}'
  10652: Il semble que tu sois encore un peu à court de gil.${prompt}
  10653: Ah, te revoilà ! Et juste à temps, je pourrais dire. La date du rituel approche à grands pas.${prompt}
  10654: 'Pour cette prochaine mission, Gilgamesh a spécifiquement demandé l’aide du précédent propriétaire du ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10655: C’est regrettable, mais il reste encore du temps. Veuillez reconsidérer votre décision.${prompt}
  10656: |-
    Excellent.
    Maintenant, laisse-moi te montrer les quartiers de Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  10657: Arrrg, si ce n'est pas mon camarade, ${name-player}. Nous te sommes très reconnaissants pour ton aide sur ce coup-là.${prompt}
  10658: Je suis sûr que Jauc t'a déjà parlé du rituel à venir que nous allons célébrer. Nous l'appelons « Yomi Okuri ». Dans la légende orientale, Yomi est le nom du lieu où errent les esprits des morts.${prompt}
  10659: Laisse-moi expliquer...${prompt}
  10660: Il y a vingt ans, avant la chute du Château Zvahl et du Seigneur des Ombres, un petit pays a été effacé de la surface de Vana'diel par ces bêtes sanguinaires.${prompt}
  10661: Ce pays était connu sous le nom de Marquisat de Tavnazia. Le drapeau que nous levons ici à Norg est celui de cette nation disparue.${prompt}
  10662: Ce fut une bataille épouvantable. Les citoyens de Tavnazia, les soldats des trois nations... Presque tous ont été massacrés en quelques heures.${prompt}
  10663: |-
    Moi aussi, j'ai vu l'apocalypse le jour où Tavnazia est tombé.
    Quand tout fut terminé, les quelques-uns d'entre nous qui restaient ont échappé sur un petit bateau.${prompt}
  10664: Mais la plupart de mes camarades étaient déjà en très mauvais état et n'ont pas survécu au long voyage de retour. Seuls quelques-uns d'entre nous ont atteint Valkurm vivants.${prompt}
  10665: À notre arrivée dans les dunes, nous avons trouvé d'autres personnes qui avaient essayé de fuir, mais avaient échoué... les épaves de leurs navires éparpillées sur les plages.${prompt}
  10666: Ceux qui pouvaient encore bouger ont utilisé ce qu'il restait de leur énergie pour creuser des tombes simples pour ceux qui étaient décédés. Mais cela ne suffisait pas à apaiser les âmes troublées qui erraient dans ces sables.${prompt}
  10667: Sans une main guide, les âmes restent dans ce monde, devenant de plus en plus en colère. Le rituel Yomi Okuri est tenu pour montrer à ces esprits perdus le chemin vers leur lieu de repos approprié.${prompt}
  10668: Jauc, prends le relais.${prompt}
  10669: Oui, monsieur.${prompt}
  10670: 'Pour que le Yomi Okuri soit correctement effectué, un katana sacré doit être fabriqué. Ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} a déjà été utilisé pour forger la lame du katana. Cependant, nous sommes encore à un pas de l’achèvement.${prompt}'
  10671: 'Quelque part sur le continent se trouve un endroit appelé le Labyrinthe d’Onzozo. Dans ces cavernes rôde un oiseau mammouth. Pour compléter le katana sacré, j’ai besoin de ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} provenant de cette bête.${prompt}'
  10672: Cependant, cet oiseau rare ne quitte presque jamais son nid. Il doit être attiré avec un appât spécial.${prompt}
  10673: Et le seul de mes camarades qui peut préparer un appât assez fin pour faire sortir ce volatile est notre chef cuisinier, Washu. Va lui en chercher avant de partir.${prompt}
  10674: 'Oh, et fais attention dans ces cavernes. Elles grouillent de toutes sortes de bêtes terribles. Obtiens-le, prends le ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, et sors de là rapidement, si tu tiens à toi.${prompt}'
  10675: 'N’oublie pas de te procurer un peu de ${color: 5}wurst savoureux de Washu${color: 1} avant de partir pour le Labyrinthe d’Onzozo. Tu en auras besoin pour attirer le grand oiseau hors de son repaire.${prompt}'
  10676: 'Oui, ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est exactement ce dont j’ai besoin pour compléter le katana sacré. Maintenant, il ne me reste plus qu’à travailler un peu plus...${prompt}'
  10677: Ne me presse pas ! Ce travail nécessite une concentration extrême. Imagine les conséquences si je devais me dépêcher dans mon travail !${prompt}
  10678: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... C'est le nom que je donne à ce katana sacré.
    Maintenant, il ne te reste plus qu'à emporter la lame à Valkurm et compléter le rituel.${prompt}
  10679: 'C’est durant cette période au-delà du crépuscule que tu dois enfoncer ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} dans la plage isolée située de l’autre côté des cavernes occidentales dans les Dunes de Valkurm. Ce n’est qu’ainsi que les esprits seront libérés.${prompt}'
  10680: Depuis l'heure où les sables sont dominés par l'obscurité jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient à nouveau baignés de lumière...${prompt}
  10681: |-
    Bienvenue à nouveau, ${name-player}.
    La nouvelle forme que cette lame a prise est la preuve que tu as réussi ta mission. Je t'applaudis pour ton courage.${prompt}
  10682: Gilgamesh m'a demandé de te remettre ceci en signe de notre reconnaissance. Porte-le avec fierté et qu'il te guide sur ton chemin de vie.${prompt}
  10683: |-
    Norg a de nombreux liens avec la nation disparue de Tavnazia, et beaucoup de personnes ici la considèrent encore comme leur terre d'origine.
    La bataille qui a eu lieu il y a vingt ans a coûté la vie à de nombreux frères, mais les sacrifices qu'ils ont faits n'ont pas été vains.${prompt}
  10684: Ce jour-là, quelque chose a changé en Gilgamesh. Il est passé d'un simple soldat à un grand leader qui allait nous rassembler et créer le Norg d'aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  10685: Alors tu es l'aventurier que Gilgamesh a envoyé, hein ? Sors une feuille de papier et un crayon. Tu vas devoir aller chercher les quatre objets suivants.${prompt}
  10686: |-
    Quoi ? Tu pensais que j'aurais tout ce dont tu as besoin ici ? Avec la façon dont ces voyous mangent, j'ai à peine assez de nourriture pour les chiens !
    Oh, ne t'inquiète pas. Avec la manière dont vous aventuriers mettez tout en vente aux enchères, tu devrais pouvoir obtenir ces objets assez facilement.${prompt}
  10687: 'Tout ce dont j’ai besoin est ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  10688: Quand tu auras les quatre, apporte-les-moi. Je te préparerai ton appât en un rien de temps.${prompt}
  10689: Quoi, tu as déjà oublié ce que je t’ai demandé ? Et tu t’appelles aventurier !${prompt}
  10690: Eh bien, c’était rapide. Plutôt bien pour un aventurier. Il y a peut-être encore de l’espoir pour toi ! Ha ha ha !${prompt}
  10691: Maintenant, laisse-moi préparer ton appât pour les oiseaux, comme promis.${prompt}
  10692: |-
    Voilà.
    Fais attention, cependant. D'après ce que j'entends, cet endroit d'Onzozo est beaucoup plus rude que nos jungles.${prompt}
  10693: Pourquoi es-tu encore là ? Tu dois livrer mon appât à l'oiseau avant qu'il ne se gâte. Si tu étais un monstre, te contenterais-tu d'un repas avarié ?${prompt}
  10694: ${name-player} ! Encore une fois, des problèmes se préparent à Norg, et nous avons besoin de tes services.${prompt}
  10695: |-
    Je vois. Donc tu es occupé...
    Cependant, il y a encore du temps. Je prie pour que tu reviennes rapidement.${prompt}
  10696: Ta gratitude est appréciée par nous tous ici à Norg. Passons maintenant aux appartements de Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  10697: |-
    Arrrg, bienvenue à nouveau, ${name-player}.
    Laisse-moi te mettre au courant de la situation dans laquelle nous nous trouvons.${prompt}
  10698: |-
    Un voleur nous a dérobé un de nos trésors.
    Je pense que c'est un autre groupe de pirates. J'ai envoyé mes hommes sur leurs traces.${prompt}
  10699: Tu pourrais penser que les problèmes entre pirates devraient être réglés par les pirates eux-mêmes – et tu as raison. Mais cette fois, la situation est un peu plus compliquée.${prompt}
  10700: 'L’objet que le voleur a volé est un ancien casque laissé par mes ancêtres, appelé ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Mais ce n’est pas un casque ordinaire.${prompt}'
  10701: On dit que mon père a piégé l'esprit d'un démon maléfique dans ce casque après une bataille épuisante dans les terres du Nord. Il y a mis de nombreux sceaux magiques pour garder la bête à distance.${prompt}
  10702: C'est probablement la raison pour laquelle nos pirates rivaux ont décidé de mettre leurs sales mains dessus.${prompt}
  10703: Pour faire court, j'ai besoin que tu trouves l'homme qui a eu le culot de me voler, et que tu récupères ce casque. Pas trop difficile pour un aventurier comme toi, hein ?${prompt}
  10704: Et si, pour une raison quelconque, le sceau magique sur le casque venait à être brisé, nous aurions besoin que tu... eh bien, tu sais ce qu'il te faudra faire alors.${prompt}
  10705: En raison de la nature délicate de ce problème, peu de personnes ici à Norg sont informées de ce qui s'est passé. Cependant, les hommes que j'ai envoyés pour traquer les voleurs devraient avoir de bonnes informations pour toi, mais d'abord tu dois les retrouver.${prompt}
  10706: Actuellement, Gilgamesh a envoyé des hommes fouiller Vana'diel pour obtenir des indices sur l'emplacement des voleurs. Recherche-les et découvre quelles nouvelles informations ils ont recueillies.${prompt}
  10707: La situation est devenue plus grave que je ne l'avais imaginé. Il est seulement question de temps avant que le sceau sur le casque ne se brise, s'il ne l'a pas déjà fait.${prompt}
  10708: Prends ceci. Il peut être utilisé pour éteindre le pouvoir de l'esprit maléfique pendant une courte période.${prompt}
  10709: 'Jette ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} dans le portail magique. Après cela, tu devrais pouvoir entrer. Mais méfie-toi de ce qui se cache de l’autre côté !${prompt}'
  10710: Espèce d'imbécile ! Comment as-tu pu te débarrasser d'un objet aussi important ? Sans lui, comment es-tu censé briser le sceau maudit sur le portail ?${prompt}
  10711: 'À en juger par ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, je peux deviner que le sceau était déjà brisé lorsque tu es arrivé au sanctuaire. Il est étonnant que le sceau ait tenu pendant toutes ces décennies.${prompt}'
  10712: Tu as bien travaillé, ${name-player}. Sans ta force et ta persévérance, nous n'aurions pas pu faire taire cet esprit maléfique. Nous sommes tous en ta dette.${prompt}
  10713: |-
    Cependant, avant de te donner ta récompense, il y a une dernière petite tâche que je souhaite te confier.
    Ce serait une abomination de laisser le casque dans cet état endommagé. Nous devons faire quelque chose pour le réparer.${prompt}
  10714: 'Hmmm... Nous avons la plupart des matériaux nécessaires pour le réparer ici à Norg, mais j’ai peur que nous n’ayons pas assez de ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10715: 'Apporte-moi un ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Je suis sûr que tu connais un artisan qui peut te fournir ce matériau. Je commencerai à réparer le casque quand tu me l’auras apporté.${prompt}'
  10716: 'Le casque est dans un état terrible. Cependant, je pense qu’avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, je pourrais le réparer.${prompt}'
  10717: Oui, c'est ce dont j'ai besoin pour réparer le casque endommagé. Je vais commencer tout de suite. Cependant, cela pourrait prendre beaucoup de temps. Son état est bien pire que ce que j'avais imaginé.${prompt}
  10718: Pourquoi me pressent-tu dans mon travail ? Comme je te l'ai dit, le casque était dans un état terrible lorsque tu me l'as apporté. Mon travail doit être précis si je veux le ramener à sa gloire d'antan !${prompt}
  10719: 'Ah, ${name-player}. Je viens de terminer les réparations du ${item-singular: 0[2]}. J’ai dû remplacer une grande partie du casque, mais je pense avoir réussi à lui redonner son éclat d’antan.${prompt}'
  10720: |-
    Oui, ta récompense. Je ne l'ai pas oubliée.
    Discutons de tout cela dans les quartiers de Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  10721: Arrrg, je suis désolé de t'avoir mêlé à nos affaires de pirates, mais je suis très heureux de te voir de retour sain et sauf à Norrrg.${prompt}
  10722: Tu as toute ma reconnaissance pour tout ce que tu as fait pour nous.${prompt}
  10723: Si ce n'était pas pour toi, nous aurions encore peur du jour où ce démon réapparaîtrait et nous dévorerait tous. Mais maintenant que le démon est parti, il ne reste plus qu'un joli casque à trôner sur mon mur.${prompt}
  10724: 'Mais quel est l’intérêt d’un casque sans tête pour le porter ? Ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} te serait plus utile qu’il ne serait à ramasser la poussière dans mes quartiers. Prends-le ! Tu l’as bien mérité !${prompt}'
  10725: 'Je suis encore étonné de voir combien tu as mûri depuis que j’ai forgé ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} il y a de nombreuses lunes. Je ne peux qu’imaginer les grandes choses qui attendent un guerrier aussi talentueux.${prompt}'
  10726: Alors, tu as décidé d'aider !${prompt}

  10737: Il doit y avoir un moyen d’ouvrir ce mur. Une sorte de clé...${prompt}
  10738: Arrrg ! J’ai trouvé !
    Tu dis que les Zilart utilisaient des cristaux pour alimenter leurs machines étranges, non ? Alors peut-être...${prompt}
  10739: Je pense que je sais comment passer cette grille.${prompt}
  10740: Écoute bien, ${name-player}. Je veux que tu trouves une Mithra nommée Mary ou Maroo ou quelque chose dans ce genre. Elle était à Norg il y a un certain temps, mais maintenant elle pourrait être n’importe où sur les continents.${prompt}
  10741: Pourquoi tout ce tracas à cause d’un chat ? Eh bien, quand cette femme était ici, elle a essayé de nous vendre un cristal étrange qu’elle a dit avoir trouvé dans le Sanctuaire de Zi’Tah.${prompt}
  10742: Je ne pense pas qu’elle essayait de nous arnaquer, mais personne n’était intéressé par sa trouvaille, alors elle a fait ses valises et est partie ailleurs.${prompt}
  10743: Mais maintenant que j’y pense, ce cristal qu’elle a trouvé à Zi’Tah pourrait bien être ce que nous cherchons.${prompt}
  10744: Une voleuse comme elle ne sera pas facile à trouver. Je vais faire en sorte que mes hommes à travers Vana’diel répandent la nouvelle que tu cherches un cristal comme celui qu’elle possède.${prompt}
  10745: Si elle entend parler de cette info, il est probable que Maroo se calmera jusqu’à ce que tu la trouves. Nous pouvons seulement espérer que ce qu’elle a est ce dont nous avons besoin.${prompt}
  10746: Arrrg, donc c’est le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que nous cherchions. On dirait que tu as eu du mal à mettre la main dessus.${prompt}
  10747: Mais l’enfer véritable reste à venir, ${name-player}. Guerriers de cristal...îles flottantes... Cela peut sembler fou, mais ne te laisse pas décourager. Tu es le seul espoir de Vana’diel.${prompt}
  10748: Arrrg, as-tu réussi à atteindre Tu’Lia ?${prompt}
  10749: Oh, donc tu as fait marcher les Guerriers de cristal ? Il ne nous reste plus qu’à nous occuper de ce petit prince. Mais d’abord, nous devons trouver un moyen d’entrer dans ce maudit sanctuaire.${prompt}
  10750: Est-ce Eald’narche qui nous empêche d’entrer, ou est-ce autre chose ?${prompt}
  10751: Écoute bien, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10752: Si le prince avait déjà ouvert la Porte des Dieux, Vana’diel ne serait plus là. Mais comme tu peux le voir, rien n’a changé jusqu’à présent.${prompt}
  10753: Ce qui signifie que tout ce que nous pouvons faire, c’est attendre. Quand Eald’narche fera son mouvement... c’est là que nous attaquerons !${prompt}
  10754: Toi et moi détestons que les Zilart se moquent de nous, mais pour l’instant, nous ne pouvons rien faire.${prompt}
  10755: Nous ne pouvons pas savoir quand Eald’narche tentera d’ouvrir la porte. Ça pourrait être demain, pour tout ce que je sais. Si tu as des préparations à faire, je te conseille de les faire maintenant.${prompt}
  10756: Hé, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]. Tu sembles avoir besoin d’argent, et quoi de plus facile pour obtenir des gil que de tenter ta chance avec Dame Chance ?${prompt}

  10758: Laisse-moi t’expliquer comment ça fonctionne. Un jeu de Lancer Chanceux se joue chaque jour de Vana’diel.${prompt}
  10759: Un tour coûte 100 gil, mais tant que tu continues à payer, tu peux continuer à jouer.${prompt}
  10760: Pour chaque 100 gil, tu obtiens un lancer de notre dé à six faces. Le nombre qui apparaît est ajouté au total courant pour ce jour.${prompt}
  10761: L’aventurier chanceux qui lance le dé et fait passer le total courant au-dessus de 400 gagne... accroche-toi... un incroyable 10000 gil !${prompt}
  10762: Et ce n’est pas tout ! Tu recevras des prix supplémentaires si le total atteint 401 ou 402, et un super bonus si ton lancer fait exactement 400 !${prompt}
  10763: Mais fais attention ; la seule fois où tu peux connaître le total courant, c’est après avoir lancé le dé.${prompt}
  10764: Et voilà ! Assez simple, non ?
    Tu peux attaquer dès le début, ou tu peux attendre que d’autres personnes lancent le dé, puis intervenir pour le coup final. Nous te fournissons le dé, tu choisis ta stratégie.${prompt}

  10781: Arrrg, je vois que tu es revenu sain et sauf.${prompt}
  10782: Ton histoire ne fera pas les annales de l’histoire, mais il y a certaines choses qui sont mieux laissées dans l’ombre.${prompt}
  10783: Si ce n’était pas pour toi, nous serions tous endormis au fond du coffre de Davy Jones. Tu as ma reconnaissance, camarade.${prompt}
  10784: Quant à Lion... Aldo est venu me donner tous les détails sur ce qu’elle a fait.${prompt}
  10785: Que pensait-elle, partir et se faire tuer avant son propre père...${prompt}
  10786: Elle a échoué sur la rive ici quand elle n’était encore qu’une gamine. Personne ne savait d’où elle venait...${prompt}
  10787: Mais ce n’était pas rare pendant la Grande Guerre. Beaucoup de vies ont été déchirées à l’époque.${prompt}
  10788: Et quand mon père m’a dit de m’occuper d’elle... eh bien, je peux te dire que je n’étais pas prêt pour ça.${prompt}
  10789: Mais élever Lion m’a appris beaucoup sur le monde. Si ce n’était pas pour elle, je ne serais pas l’homme que je suis aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  10790: Je n’ai jamais su ce qu’elle pensait de son père étant pirate...${prompt}
  10791: Mais je peux te dire une chose : je suis sacrément fier de l’avoir comme fille.${prompt}
  10792: Arrrg, le rêve des Zilart pour le Paradis peut être terminé, mais cela ne change pas le fait que ces bêtes continuent de grouiller sur le visage de Vana’diel.${prompt}
  10793: Quand on y pense, ce petit jeu avec les princes n’était peut-être que la partie émergée de l’iceberg maudit.${prompt}
  10794: Et Lion... Je n’ai pas dit aux autres pirates ce qui est réellement arrivé. Ils pensent tous qu’elle est partie pour une aventure...${prompt}
  10795: Il est toujours plus facile d’oublier ce qui nous trouble. C’est pourquoi les gens oublient toujours ceux qui sont partis. Je ne veux pas que cela arrive à ma fille. C’est pourquoi elle vivra toujours ici à Norg.${prompt}
  10796: "${name-player}, je sens que tes compétences se sont beaucoup améliorées depuis que tu as brandi le ${color: 5}mumeito${color: 1} que j’ai forgé pour toi il y a de nombreuses lunes. Cependant, tu as encore beaucoup de distance à parcourir sur le chemin de la maîtrise du grand katana. Penses-tu avoir ce qu’il faut pour mener à bien ton voyage ?${prompt}"
  10797: Je comprends ton hésitation. Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être hâtif dans des décisions aussi importantes. Je sais que tu reviendras ici quand tu sentiras que tu es prêt.${prompt}
  10798: Je ne détecte aucune hésitation dans ton esprit et ton esprit. C’est bon.${prompt}
  10799: "Tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} et manie-le comme s’il faisait partie de ton propre corps. Lorsque tu auras prouvé ta force et ta capacité, la lame perdra son pouvoir. Alors tu sauras qu’elle t’a accepté.${prompt}"
  10800: Quand tu sentiras que le moment est venu, reviens ici avec le katana.${prompt}
  10801: Cette épreuve te mettra à l’épreuve de nombreuses façons, physiquement et mentalement. Cependant, je suis certain que tu seras capable de franchir la montagne qui se dresse devant toi.${prompt}
  10802: "Lorsque tu auras prouvé ta force et ta capacité, le ${item-singular: 0[2]} perdra son pouvoir. Alors tu sauras qu’il t’a accepté.${prompt}"
  10803: Qu’est-ce qui t’amène aujourd’hui ?${prompt}
  10804: Je sens encore beaucoup de potentiel en toi. Cette épreuve est conçue pour faire ressortir ce potentiel afin que tu puisses le raffiner davantage et l’utiliser pleinement.${prompt}
  10805: Attends. Tu n’as pas besoin d’en dire plus. Je me rends compte que j’ai échoué à souligner la rareté de cette lame, mais je ne pensais pas que tu pourrais perdre un objet aussi important.${prompt}
  10806: |-
    Cependant, il n’y a pas lieu de craindre. J’ai un autre ${item-singular: 0[2]} que je peux te prêter, mais tu devras recommencer l’épreuve depuis le début.
    Et cette fois, fais plus attention. Je ne tolérerai plus aucune erreur.${prompt}
  10807: Que puis-je entendre ? Tu ne penses pas vraiment abandonner ton voyage, si ?${prompt}
  10808: |-
    Je vois que tu as pris ta décision...
    J’étais certain que tu avais le potentiel pour affronter les épreuves que je t’ai présentées, mais je suppose qu’un œil expérimenté comme le mien peut parfois être trompé.${prompt}

  10810: "Je te laisse le soin de te débarrasser du ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Il a déjà perdu son pouvoir et n’est plus utile pour moi.${prompt}"
  10811: Tu as accepté cette quête avec l’intention de la compléter, n’est-ce pas ? Si tu as le temps de jouer des tours à un vieux bonhomme fragile, tu devrais être sur le champ de bataille à améliorer tes techniques !${prompt}
  10812: Je peux encore sentir l’énergie parcourir cette lame. Cela ne peut signifier qu’une chose : elle n’a pas encore accepté ta capacité. Le chemin de la maîtrise est long. On ne peut pas espérer atteindre son objectif en si peu de temps.${prompt}
  10813: "Merveilleux ! Tu es maintenant prêt pour la dernière étape de ton voyage. Voyage jusqu’à l’endroit inscrit sur ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}--le Tunnel de Kuftal. Là, tu rencontreras ta dernière épreuve.${prompt}"

    Tu es maintenant prêt à recommencer avec tes nouvelles techniques.${prompt}
  10816: "Tu as appris la compétence d’arme “Tachi: Kasha” !${prompt}"
  10817: Eh bien, regarde-toi. Je suis content de voir que tu réalises que devenir ninja ne se limite pas à lancer des sorts et à lancer des étoiles. Mais il reste encore une technique réservée aux meilleurs des meilleurs.${prompt}
  10818: Tu as appris à manier ton katana en risquant ta vie et tes membres sur le champ de bataille.${prompt}
  10819: Apprendre cette technique finale ne sera pas différent. Tu devras te rendre dans la jungle et te donner à fond comme jamais auparavant. Penses-tu avoir ce qu’il faut ?${prompt}
  10820: Hah ! Tu secoues peut-être la tête maintenant, mais je connais ton genre. Tu ne seras pas satisfait tant que tu n’auras pas atteint le sommet. Tu reviendras... et je t’attendrai.${prompt}
  10821: Je savais que tu ne pouvais pas résister au défi, mais dire que tu vas faire quelque chose est beaucoup plus facile que de le faire réellement. Si tu ne penses pas réussir, alors tu ne devrais même pas essayer en premier lieu !${prompt}
  10822: "Tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}"
  10823: "Utilise ce katana pour infliger autant de dégâts que possible. Lorsque tu auras acquis suffisamment de compétence, le ${item-singular: 0[2]} reconnaîtra ta puissance et son pouvoir s’estompera.${prompt}"
  10824: Quand cela arrivera, ramène-le ici auprès de moi.${prompt}
  10825: Mais ne pense pas que c’est la fin de ton épreuve. Quelque chose de beaucoup plus excitant t’attendra à ton retour, si tu vois ce que je veux dire. Heh heh heh.${prompt}
  10826: "Lorsque tu auras acquis suffisamment de compétence, le ${item-singular: 0[2]} reconnaîtra ta puissance et son pouvoir s’estompera.${prompt}"
  10827: Qu’est-ce que tu veux ? Tu as déjà fini, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10828: Eh bien, si c’est tout, alors sors de cette grotte et retourne sur le champ de bataille !${prompt}
  10829: "Tu as perdu le ${item-singular: 0[2]} !?${prompt}"
  10830: Idiot ! Tu avais la chance parfaite d’apprendre une nouvelle technique mortelle, et tu l’as gâchée ! J’ai vu des crabes avec plus de cervelle que toi. Va-t-en de ma vue !${prompt}
  10831: Ha ha ha. Je t’ai bien eu, n’est-ce pas ? Bien que je ne vais pas te féliciter pour ta stupidité, je vais te donner une dernière chance. Mais si tu refais une erreur, je...${prompt}
  10832: Abandonner ? T’as frappé ta tête sur le plafond de la grotte en entrant ? Tu ne penses quand même pas à abandonner maintenant, si ?${prompt}
  10833: |-

  10940: |-
    J'ai été libéré d'un monde où la vie et la mort, la réalité et l'illusion sont impossibles à distinguer.
    Je suis vraiment reconnaissant.${prompt}
  10941: Un instant...${prompt}
  10942: |-
    ...
    C'est... Jeuno !?
    Ai-je enfin retrouvé mon chemin ?${prompt}
  10943: |-
    Je... Personne ne peut me voir.
    Ce n'est qu'un reflet de la réalité.
    Ce qui signifie que tu es celui qui hérite de la hache.${prompt}
  10944: 'Hmm. Avec tes compétences affinées, tu seras un excellent maître pour ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10945: Celui qui manie cette hache doit également être beau à regarder. Apparemment, j'étais un candidat approprié. N'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10946: |-
    Félicitations.
    Je m'attends à ce que tu accomplisses de grands exploits à partir de ce jour.
    Je te demande aussi qu'un jour tu utilises ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour venger les Hydra Corps...${prompt}
  10947: '...${prompt}'
  10948: Je te félicite également... mon nouveau maître.${prompt}
  10949: |-
    Maintenant, tiens-moi haut et laisse ma lame scintiller au soleil !
    Que tes amis, ainsi que tes ennemis, se régalent de ma beauté glorieuse !${prompt}
  10950: |-
    ...
    Tu m'as trouvé.${prompt}
  10951: Mon pouvoir interdit est maintenant à toi, et je suis libéré de ma prison.${prompt}
  10952: Il te suffit de gagner son respect...${prompt}
  10953: J'ai fait un si long rêve...${prompt}
  10954: |-
    C'était un rêve tenu captif par un monde voilé.
    Non. Je dois accepter que ce n'était pas un rêve.${prompt}
  10955: |-
    Et toi ? Cherches-tu la même obscurité que moi...
    Il semble que tu aies déjà trouvé ton chemin vers ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  10956: |-
    Très bien, je vais te le transmettre.
    Mais n'oublie pas combien de sang tes compagnons ont versé dans ta quête de sa force impie.${prompt}
  10957: Et réfléchis longuement à savoir si ce pouvoir doit être utilisé. Ne finis pas comme moi...${prompt}
  10958: '...${prompt}'
  10959: |-
    Heh. Heh heh.
    Hahahahahahaha !${prompt}
  10960: |-
    Eh bien, mon nouveau maître, n'est-il pas temps de commencer le voyage vers une puissance toujours plus grande ?
    Il reste encore des ennemis à abattre, et du sang à verser...${prompt}
  10961: |-
    ...
    Tu m'as enfin déterré.${prompt}
  10962: Je suis libre de Dynamis, libre de voler à nouveau à travers les cieux.${prompt}
  10963: Il ne reste plus qu'à...${prompt}
  10964: |-
    Bonjour ?
    Est-il possible que je...${prompt}
  10965: |-
    Mais non.
    Je ne suis pas revenu dans ce royaume...
    Toi. Tu es mon successeur ?${prompt}
  10966: 'Tu sembles avoir les compétences nécessaires avec la lance. Assez pour convaincre ${item-singular: 0[2]} de te prêter son pouvoir, en tout cas.${prompt}'
  10967: Avoir cette lance sur le champ de bataille te rend égal à presque tout adversaire.${prompt}
  10968: |-
    Réfléchis bien à ce que cela signifie et à la façon dont une arme comme celle-ci doit être utilisée.
    Tu as mon admiration, aventurier. Tu as bien agi...${prompt}
  10969: '...${prompt}'
  10970: La cérémonie d'héritage est complète.${prompt}
  10971: Il est temps pour toi de partir et d'expérimenter ma force écrasante...${prompt}
  10972: |-
    ...
    Enfin, tu es arrivé.${prompt}
  10973: Grâce à toi, j'ai échappé au pays voilé.${prompt}
  10974: Tu dois maintenant obtenir l'approbation de mon maître...${prompt}
  10975: C'est vraiment dommage.${prompt}
  10976: Ce jour est arrivé bien trop tôt à mon goût.${prompt}
  10977: |-
    Cependant, tu es un maître du métier de ninja.
    Je reconnais que tu seras un porteur approprié pour ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  10978: |-
    Prends cette lame comme la tienne.
    Voyage loin sur le chemin du ninja.${prompt}
  10979: Je te surveillerai depuis les ombres...${prompt}
  10980: '...${prompt}'
  10981: Un excellent maître...${prompt}
  10982: Mon tranchant aiguisé est désormais à toi. Une acuité dite pour faire hurler même les démons...${prompt}
  10983: |-
    ...
    Ce jour est enfin arrivé.${prompt}
  10984: |-
    Je vais être libéré dans ce monde pour la première fois depuis une éternité.
    Est-ce une raison de célébrer ou de désespérer...?${prompt}
  10985: Quoi qu'il en soit...${prompt}
  10986: Que se passe-t-il ici ?${prompt}
  10987: Ah, mon successeur est arrivé.${prompt}
  10988: 'J'ai cherché à maîtriser la voie du samouraï et me suis rendu en Extrême-Orient pour l'entraînement. Lorsque j'ai acquis ${item-singular: 0[2]} et suis revenu chez moi, la Grande Guerre avait commencé.${prompt}'
  10989: Quand j'y pense, ma vie a été un long chemin de souffrances. Mais voir l'arrivée de mon successeur me fait sentir que tout n'a pas été vain.${prompt}
  10990: |-
    Tu as ma gratitude.
    Adieu, ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}
  10991: '...${prompt}'
  10992: Il a été difficile d'atteindre ce point.${prompt}
  10993: |-
    Mais ton voyage dans la voie du samouraï ne fait que commencer.
    Tu n'as pas encore atteint la perfection.
    Continuons ton entraînement...${prompt}
  10994: |-
    ...
    Enfin, tu es arrivé.${prompt}
  10995: Je n'étais pas convaincu que tu étais sérieux au sujet de l'achèvement de cet essai...${prompt}
  10996: Tu m'as prouvé le contraire...${prompt}
  10997: J'ai entendu parler de ta venue.${prompt}
  10998: Tu es le nouveau maître de ce marteau de guerre ?${prompt}
  10999: |-
    Chaque fois que ${item-singular: 0[2]} renaît, il obtient un nouveau porteur, qui doit finalement le transmettre à un successeur.
    J'ai manœuvré ce marteau pendant plus de huit cents ans. Je n'avais jamais souhaité m'en séparer.${prompt}
  11000: "Cependant, il n'y a que peu de sens à le garder maintenant. \nSi tu manies cette arme pour une cause juste, je te transmets son pouvoir.${prompt}"
  11001: |-
    Maintenant, prends le marteau et pars !
    Fais juste attention à la manière dont tu le manipules.
    Ne laisse pas sa puissance te écraser aussi...${prompt}
11002: '...${prompt}'
  11003: Ma puissance est à toi.${prompt}
  11004: Pars et expérimente la force destructrice qui a terrassé le Serpent de la Terre...${prompt}
  11005: |-
    ...
    Alors, tu m'as trouvé.${prompt}
  11006: |-
    Je dois te remercier.
    J'ai été libéré de l'enfer de Dynamis et je peux retrouver ma véritable puissance une fois de plus.${prompt}
  11007: Et maintenant...${prompt}
  11008: Hwaah !${prompt}
  11009: Juste au moment où je pensais être enfin revenu dans ce monde, je te trouve ici, prêt à saisir mon précieux bâton.${prompt}
  11010: |-
    Eh bien, c'est pour le mieux, je suppose.
    Dans mon état actuel, ${item-singular: 0[2]} n'est plus qu'un ornement, son pouvoir étant gaspillé.${prompt}
  11011: |-
    Je te confie ce bâton !
    Prends ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, et lie-le à toi dans un contrat de sang !${prompt}
  11012: |-
    Je te laisse maintenant.
    J'aurais seulement souhaité pouvoir rester un peu plus longtemps...${prompt}
  11013: '...${prompt}'
  11014: Je suis à toi pour être manié.${prompt}
  11015: |-
    Mais tu n'es pas encore mon maître.
    En observant tes actions à partir de maintenant, je déciderai si tu es digne du titre...${prompt}
  11016: |-
    ...
    Tu as découvert mon lieu de repos.${prompt}
  11017: La prison des âmes a libéré ses chaînes, et je suis libre de décocher des flèches dans ce monde une fois de plus.
    Merci.${prompt}
  11018: Ah, encore un test de ta patience...${prompt}
  11019: Où est cet endroit ?${prompt}
  11020: |-
    Bien sûr. Comment aurais-je pu oublier.
    Je suis Ghebben. On m'a confié cet arc par un guerrier de l'Extrême-Orient.${prompt}
  11021: |-
    Tes mains me disent que ta compétence en tir à l'arc est loin d'être ordinaire.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} s'adaptera parfaitement à ta prise assurée.${prompt}
  11022: |-
    Cependant, cet arc appartient à Sir Nasu, le guerrier dont je parlais.
    Tu dois te rappeler que tu n'en es que le gardien pour un temps.${prompt}
  11023: Adieu...${prompt}
  11024: '...${prompt}'
  11025: |-
    C'est un honneur d'être possédé par un maître juste.
    Sir Ghebben était un archer vraiment splendide.${prompt}
  11026: |-
    Tu es maintenant celui qui me tirera en combat.
    Je serai à tes côtés sur tous les chemins que tu choisis de parcourir, avec le pouvoir destructeur de mes flèches.${prompt}
  11027: |-
    ...
    Nous nous rencontrons enfin.${prompt}
  11028: Je suis maintenant libre du gouffre de Dynamis pour cracher du feu dans ce monde une fois de plus.${prompt}
  11029: Mais je dois te demander d'attendre avant de me prendre en possession...${prompt}
  11030: |-
    Pourquoi as-tu dû me réveiller ? Je passais le plus agréable des sommeils.
    Oh, cet endroit me semble familier...${prompt}
  11031: Hum ? Tu penses que c'est toi qui vas prendre mon arme à feu ?${prompt}
  11032: 'Tu sembles avoir un bon œil pour le tir. Et ${item-singular: 0[2]} serait parfaitement niché dans le creux de ton bras...${prompt}'
  11033: Eh bien, je n'ai plus d'utilisation pour cette arme, donc je suppose que tu peux la prendre. Mais il y a une chose que je veux que tu te souviennes.${prompt}
  11034: Cette arme est une arme redoutable qui déclenche une explosion sur tes ennemis, plusieurs milliers de fois plus puissante que le petit effort qu'il te faut pour tirer. Inutile de dire, fais attention à qui tu la pointes...${prompt}
  11035: '...${prompt}'
  11036: Une arme n'a pas de volonté propre. Mais elle a été faite pour un but.${prompt}
  11037: Emmène-moi sur un nouveau champ de bataille, une nouvelle arène pour la chasse...${prompt}
  11038: |-
    ...
    Je suis sauvé.${prompt}
  11039: Silencieux depuis trop longtemps dans la prison de Dynamis, je peux de nouveau laisser mon appel audacieux résonner à travers cette terre !${prompt}
  11040: Encore quelques instants, s'il te plaît...${prompt}
  11041: |-
    Bonjour.
    Je suis Terounalivet, un musicien militaire du Corps de l'Hydre.${prompt}
  11042: |-
    Tu n'as jamais entendu parler de moi ?
    Avant de rejoindre l'armée, j'étais un barde assez célèbre, assiégé par des fans dans chaque ville que je traversais.${prompt}
  11043: 'Pour être tout à fait honnête, j'ai le cœur brisé de donner le ${item-singular: 0[2]}, l'instrument le plus célèbre, même à un autre barde.${prompt}'
  11044: Mais un instrument ne montre sa véritable valeur que lorsqu'il est joué. Ce cor devrait être ravi de passer entre les mains d'un talent tel que le tien.${prompt}
  11045: Il a une âme capricieuse, mais traite-le bien. Et n'oublie pas qu'en dehors d'une bataille acharnée, tu peux toujours jouer un morceau pour le simple plaisir de ceux qui t'entourent...${prompt}
  11046: '...${prompt}'
  11047: Il était un interprète merveilleux.${prompt}
  11048: |-
    Partons.
    Notre tournée du monde ne fait que commencer...${prompt}
  11049: |-
    Tu veux parler au vieux Kamui ?
    Il n'a pas le temps de discuter de pêche avec chaque aventurier qui se présente de la jungle. Prends un numéro, mon pote.${prompt}
  11050: |-
    Tu veux parler au vieux Kamui ?
    J'ai des ordres qu'il ne faut pas déranger.
    Reviens plus tard.${prompt}
  11051: |-
    Comment as-tu su d'apporter quelque chose comme ça ?
    Le vieux Kamui adore les plats épicés.${prompt}
  11052: |-
    Attends ici.
    Je vais aller le chercher pour toi.${prompt}
  11053: '${name-player}, bon travail pour avoir obtenu le ${item-singular: 1[2]} et les autres aliments.${prompt}'
  11054: Je vais écouter ce que Kamui a à dire avec toi.${prompt}
  11055: |-
    Désolé de t'avoir fait attendre.
    On m'a informé que tu m'as apporté des cadeaux délicieux.${prompt}
  11056: Comment as-tu obtenu ces articles ? Tu dois être impliqué dans les affaires de Tavnazia dont Gilgamesh a parlé.${prompt}
  11057: |-
    Dans ce cas, je te donnerai toute ma coopération.
    Tavnazia est ma patrie. Nous vivions dans le Marquisat quand Lugalbanda était notre dirigeant.${prompt}
  11058: |-
    Tu es de Tavnazia ?
    Nous sommes venus ici depuis Kazham après avoir consulté l'ancienne cheffe, Romaa Mihgo.${prompt}
  11059: |-
    Nous souhaitons entendre l'histoire d'une boîte brillante.
    La cheffe a dit que tu pourrais connaître une telle histoire.${prompt}
  11060: Tu parles du trésor de Tavnazia--le “vase de baptême” ?${prompt}
  11061: Cherches-tu, toi aussi, le pouvoir de la magicite...?${prompt}
  11062: |-
    Magicite ?
    Non, nous ne sommes pas venus demander ce rocher maudit.${prompt}
  11063: |-
    Nous recherchons un cristal des ténèbres dit se trouver quelque part dans les Terres du Nord.
    Sais-tu quelque chose de cette légende ?${prompt}
  11064: |-
    Un cristal des ténèbres...
    Cela doit être lié à l'histoire d'un soldat qui a trouvé le vase de baptême dans ces terres gelées.${prompt}
  11065: L'histoire se déroule à l'époque où le roi Ranperre régnait sur le Royaume de San d'Oria...${prompt}
  11066: Une horde d'Orcs est un jour arrivée du continent nord pour tenter un débarquement sur Quon.${prompt}
  11067: La chaîne de l'Uleguerand, au nord de Xarcabard, est devenue le point de départ de la campagne orque.${prompt}
  11068: Pour stopper cette invasion, la marine de Tavnazia est sortie en mer tandis que le roi Ranperre dirigeait une armée par voie terrestre...${prompt}
  11069: Les plaines enneigées se sont teintées de rouge avec d'innombrables escarmouches sanglantes menées en défense de Quon.${prompt}
  11070: Au milieu de cette bataille féroce, un soldat de San d'Oria a glissé et est tombé dans une crevasse.${prompt}
  11071: Alors qu'il cherchait une issue dans les tunnels sinueux, le soldat a entendu une voix éphémère l'appeler.${prompt}
  11072: Le soldat a commencé à marcher dans la direction de la voix, et a finalement découvert une vue inattendue. Juste devant lui se trouvait un lac gelé, brillant d'une lumière étrange...${prompt}
  11073: Et ensuite, que s'est-il passé ?${prompt}
  11074: On dit que le soldat a été adressé par la voix d'un dieu, mais personne ne sait ce qui a été dit entre eux.${prompt}
  11075: L'histoire se termine par le retour du soldat des Terres du Nord portant une boîte mystérieuse. Cette boîte est devenue un reliquaire sacré de la Cathédrale de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11076: Un lac gelé dans la chaîne de l'Uleguerand, au-delà des terres de Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11077: |-
    Maintenant que j'y pense, il y a trente ans, une Mithra est partie à la recherche du lac après avoir entendu ce conte.
    Elle a échoué.${prompt}
  11078: Apparemment, elle a rejoint une expédition alliée pour son voyage vers les Terres du Nord...${prompt}
  11079: Yow Rabntah recherchait le lac gelé !?${prompt}
  11080: Oui, mais ses expériences dans cette terre maléfique ont déformé son âme.${prompt}
  11081: Son retour à Kazham a déclenché un conflit intertribal qui a coûté la vie à de nombreux Mithra.${prompt}
  11082: |-
    Après cet incident, Romaa Mihgo est devenue cheffe, et son règne a causé d'autres problèmes entre Kazham et Norg.
    Mais avec le recul, c'était probablement inévitable.${prompt}
  11083: Ah, je me suis écarté de notre discussion initiale.${prompt}
  11084: |-
    Non, pas du tout.
    Cela a été très instructif, merci.${prompt}
  11085: Selon l'histoire de Kamui, Yow Rabntah a rejoint l'expédition alliée de son propre gré.${prompt}
  11086: Romaa Mihgo n'était-elle pas au courant de ce fait ?${prompt}
  11087: |-
    Hmm.
    La chaîne de l'Uleguerand n'est pas un endroit à visiter à la légère.${prompt}
  11088: Appelons les aventuriers de la Rhinostery dans les Terres du Nord pour obtenir de l'aide !${prompt}
  11089: |-
    ${name-player}, rejoins-moi à la tour sur le Glacier de Beaucedine où se trouvent mes collègues de la Rhinostery.
    D'ici là !${prompt}
  11090: Ce Tarutaru avec qui tu es venu, c'est un aventurier pour la Rhinostery, non ?${prompt}
  11091: |-
    Il a parlé de visiter une tour à Beaucedine.
    S'ils cherchent à étudier le trésor censé s'y trouver, ils perdent leur temps. Il a été volé et vendu il y a des années.${prompt}
  11092: mes1${prompt}
  11093: Hé, regarde, c'est un aventurier puant !${prompt}
  11094: Nous sommes occupés à fêter la fin d'une journée de travail difficile, alors pourquoi ne t'en irais-tu pas ailleurs ?${prompt}
  11095: Je parie que tu n'as jamais vu une telle bière, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11096: Cette goutte, mon ami, ne se trouve que dans les mystérieuses terres de l'Extrême-Orient.${prompt}
  11097: |-
    Écoute bien, ${choice: 0}[jeune fille/bleu].
    Nous, les pirates, avons une haine profonde pour les soi-disant “héros” comme toi.${prompt}
  11098: Quiconque n'a jamais bravé les mers pour la bataille et le butin est encore un chiot tremblant pour un pirate.${prompt}
  11099: |-
    Oho, tu as quelque chose à dire à ce sujet, n'est-ce pas ?
    Un défi, alors. Si tu peux apporter un trésor pour éblouir un pirate blasé, tu pourrais trouver une place à notre table.${prompt}
  11100: Arrgh, pas que nous attendions grand-chose d'un bleu comme toi !${prompt}
  11101: |-
    Sohyon avait l'habitude d'avoir un de ces oiseaux parlants qui se perchaient sur son épaule.
    Peut-être pourrais-tu nous en trouver un ?${prompt}
  11102: "Ou peut-être pourrais-tu te laisser pousser une barbe rouge et touffue.
    Ça m'impressionnerait.${prompt}"
  11103: |-
    Ahahaha !
    Ça pourrait être un peu trop demander, hein ?${prompt}
  11104: |-
    Je te le dis.
    Si tu peux apporter une boisson qui réchauffe l'âme d'un pirate, je te donnerai ce qu'il y a à trouver à Norg.${prompt}
  11105: Arrgh, voilà un marché !${prompt}
  11106: Que dirais-tu de lui présenter cette jeune fille qui est entrée il y a quelque temps ?${prompt}
  11107: |-
    Attends une minute, espèce de traître !
    Je l'avais repérée, celle-là !${prompt}
  11108: Que dirais-tu de lui présenter à l'un des deux qui sont entrés il y a quelque temps ?${prompt}
  11109: Oui, ça devrait la tenir à l'écart de nos affaires.${prompt}
  11110: Souviens-toi juste que je l'avais vue en premier.${prompt}
  11111: |-
    Assez de bavardages, tas de chiens galeux.
    Tu sais ce que tu as à faire, aventurier.${prompt}
  11112: |-
    J'attendrai ici avec ma coupe vide.
    Heh-heh-heh.${prompt}
  11113: |-
    Sohyon a bu tout ce qu'il y avait à boire.
    Bonne chance pour lui trouver quelque chose qui le satisfasse.${prompt}
  11114: Arrgh, voyons de quoi tu es fait, aventurier.${prompt}
  11115: Ma coupe est toujours vide, aventurier.${prompt}
  11116: |-
    Ces gars-là ne seront jamais satisfaits, peu importe ce que tu apportes.
    Tu ferais mieux de continuer ta route.${prompt}
  11117: Prends cette flasque.${prompt}
  11118: |-
    Remplis-la à partir des quatre grandes palourdes dans le tunnel de Korroloka.
    Nous verrons qui rira le dernier...${prompt}
  11119: Bien joué. Maintenant, donne-la à Sohyon.${prompt}
  11120: |-
    Arrgh, tu m'as fait attendre assez longtemps.
    À ta santé !${prompt}
  11121: |-
    Urgh !
    C'est de l'eau plate ! Quel genre de mauvais tour essaies-tu de jouer ?${prompt}
  11122: Tu as avalé tant de liquides que tu ne peux probablement plus distinguer une bonne boisson d'une mauvaise.${prompt}
  11123: Rince-toi la bouche avec ça et fais une pause pendant un moment !${prompt}
  11124: |-
    Tu essaies de me dire comment boire ?
    Je n'ai pas besoin de tes conseils pourris !${prompt}
  11125: Ta langue doit être pourrie, Sohyon.${prompt}
  11126: Ce liquide est l'eau la plus rafraîchissante et revitalisante de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11127: Elle vient des palourdes géantes du tunnel de Korroloka. Si tu prenais un moment pour savourer le goût, tu te rendrais compte que ce n'est pas juste de l'eau ordinaire.${prompt}
  11128: '...${prompt}'
  11129: Eh bien, je suppose que tu as tenu ta part du marché.${prompt}
  11130: Prends cette clé et donne-la à Gimb, le Galka qui se tient près de la porte d'entrée. Il s'occupera de toi.${prompt}
  11131: |-
    Dégage d'ici.
    Je n'ai pas de temps à perdre avec des aventuriers minables.${prompt}
  11132: 'Tu es ici pour rencontrer le ${choice: 0}[gars/la fille] du couple qui est arrivé il y a quelque temps ?${prompt}'
  11133: Attends ici un moment.${prompt}
  11134: |-
    Hmmm.
    Je ne trouve pas la fille.
    Où a-t-elle bien pu aller ?${prompt}
  11135: |-
    Merci d'être venu !
    Tu es un sauveur, kupopo !${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Un instant, maintenant.
    Où est passée cette fille rêveuse ?${prompt}
  11137: Sanctia ? Oh, elle est partie il y a très, très longtemps, kupopo.${prompt}
  11138: 'Je lui ai donné quelques ${item-plural: 1[2]} et elle m'a laissé son dîner, kupopo.${prompt}'
  11139: Sanctia rêve de devenir une redoutable chasseuse de primes, kupopo !${prompt}
  11140: |-
    Attends un peu, mon pote.
    Elle compte vraiment trouver Goldmane, le légendaire chasseur de primes ?${prompt}
  11141: C'est lui qui a attrapé le célèbre Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  11142: J'ai entendu dire qu'il avait gagné une montagne de gils pour ce travail, mais le reste de la bande d'Atarefaunet veut toujours sa tête.${prompt}
  11143: Les rumeurs disent que Goldmane s'est caché après que le gang ait commencé à le chercher.${prompt}
  11144: Ouais, et s'il respire encore, cela signifie que ces bandits vicieux ne l'ont pas encore trouvé.${prompt}
  11145: Un gars capable de semer ces types ne sera jamais trouvé par une novice comme Sanctia.${prompt}
  11146: Et si sa quête pour trouver Goldmane attire l'attention, cela éveillera l'intérêt de la bande d'Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  11147: L'idée était de la faire patienter à Norg pendant un moment, puis de laisser Gilgamesh lui expliquer les grandes lacunes de son plan.${prompt}
  11148: Mais c'est terrible, kupopo !${prompt}
  11149: Sanctia a dit qu'elle allait à Bastok, kupopo !${prompt}
  11150: Ne me dis pas qu'elle s'est cachée à bord du bateau en direction de Bastok ?${prompt}

  11165: Nous avons toujours traîné dans cet endroit comme s'il s'agissait d'une aire de jeux, donc il ne devrait pas se perdre.${prompt}
  11166: Je n'ai pas vu la tête de ce petit crétin une seule fois depuis qu'il a décidé de partir.${prompt}
  11167: Dernièrement, les gens de Norg sont en colère à cause de tous les monstres qui apparaissent dans la grotte.${prompt}
  11168: J'ai dit à cet imbécile de Gubokka d'être prudent, mais malgré tout...${prompt}
  11169: Je veux aller vérifier ce qu'il est devenu, mais y aller seul dans ce trou infesté de monstres, c'est chercher plus de problèmes.${prompt}

  11182: Je pensais pouvoir faire quelque chose à ce sujet... C'est pourquoi je suis parti. Je voulais vaincre les monstres pour les habitants de Norg.${prompt}
  11183: Mais j'ai fini par me perdre dans les grottes que j'avais parcourues pendant des années. Pathétique, je sais.${prompt}

  11189: Soudain, il m'avait coincé...${prompt}
  11190: Ma vie a commencé à défiler devant mes yeux. Je savais que j'allais mourir.${prompt}

    Tu sais, Gubokka, penser aux autres est très noble.
    Il n'y a pas de doute là-dessus. Mais tu dois arrêter de te surpasser !${prompt}
  11201: |-
    Il y a longtemps, j'avais un bon ami.
    Il n'arrêtait pas de parler de faire le bien et tout ça, et à quoi cela l'a-t-il mené ? À une mort inutile, c'est tout !${prompt}

  11207: |-
    ...
    Je suis désolé, mais je dois retourner l'aider !
    Il pourrait mourir si je ne le fais pas !${prompt}

    Espèce d'idiot ! Ne me fais pas me répéter !
    Que peux-tu bien faire là-bas tout seul ?
    Ferme-la et tais-toi !${prompt}
  11209: M-mais...${prompt}

    Hé, aventurier, tu as l'air d'avoir déjà combattu.
    Puisque tu n'as pas eu l'occasion de chercher Gubokka, pourrais-tu chercher ce Hume à la place ?${prompt}
  11211: Je veux que tu ailles à la Grotte du Serpent de Mer avec Gubokka et que tu t'assures qu'il est en sécurité !${prompt}
  11212: |-
    Je t'attendrai ici.
    Bien sûr, tu recevras une belle petite récompense.
    Ne te surmène pas trop.${prompt}
  11213: |-
    Je te confie Gubokka.
    Je me demande si ce guerrier Hume est en sécurité...?${prompt}

    Alors c'est ce qui s'est passé...
    Quelle perte malheureuse...${prompt}
  11215: |-
    Si seulement j'avais eu plus de pouvoir...
    J'aurais pu le sauver !${prompt}
  11216: |-
    Tu peux continuer à t'apitoyer sur ton sort si tu penses que ça résoudra quelque chose.
    Mais ce que tu devrais faire maintenant, c'est offrir à cet homme des funérailles dignes de ce nom.
    ...Qu'est-ce que tu as là ?${prompt}
  11217: |-
    C'est l'épée que tenait le guerrier Hume...
    Son dernier souhait était qu'elle soit enterrée avec ses os.${prompt}

  11219: Je suppose que je ne peux plus t'arrêter maintenant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

    Très bien. Je ne te gênerai pas.

    Ohhh...vraiment !?
    Mais cette épée n'est-elle pas importante pour toi ?${prompt}
  11223: |-
    Non...c'est bon.
    En échange, tu dois me promettre quelque chose.${prompt}

    Cette épée est sacrément puissante, alors quand tu aideras les pauvres gens de Vana'diel, fais-en bon usage !
    Je suis sûr que tu pourras l'utiliser pour une bonne cause un jour !${prompt}
  11225: |-
    Haha ! Ça ressemble bien à quelque chose que tu dirais, me mettre sur le grill !
    Mais je t'entends. Je tiendrai la promesse.${prompt}

  11267: Non pas que nous, les moogles, refusions ce genre de don, kupo.${prompt}

  11270: Quand il sera temps de récupérer votre objet, il vous suffira de me donner un seul bordereau de stockage, n'importe lequel.${prompt}

  11275: |-
    Pourquoi, vous demandez ? Eh bien, même nous, les moogles, ne sommes pas parfaits !
    Il est préférable pour nous deux que vous gardiez vos objets les plus précieux à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}
  11276: Maintenant, écoutez bien, car il y a un autre piège, et c'est un sacré coup.${prompt}
  11277: |-
    Si vous perdez votre bordereau de stockage, je ne pourrai jamais vous rendre votre objet. Jamais. Pas de "si", "et" ou "mais" !
    Pas de "Je suis désolé, Monsieur Moogle Porteur, cela ne se reproduira plus !"
    Les règles sont les règles, kupo, et quelqu'un doit les respecter.${prompt}

    Tu as plus l'air de nourriture pour pugil que d'aventurier à mes yeux.
    Va-t'en ! J'ai des poissons plus importants à attraper.${prompt}
  11313: |-
    Hmph, alors tu te prends pour un ${choice-player-gender}[héros/héroïne], hein ?
    Je suppose que tu en as l'air suffisamment. Que dirais-tu si je te révélais un petit secret ?${prompt}
  11314: |-
    Tu as entendu parler de l'opération Voidwatch, n'est-ce pas ?
    Eh bien, je suis chargé de distribuer les missions pour cela dans ces environs.${prompt}
  11315: |-
    La version officielle est que le Grand Duché de Jeuno supervise toute l'organisation, avec des branches locales dans chacune des trois nations.
    Mais tout marin qui se respecte devrait déjà le savoir ; sinon, je te suggère de sortir les algues de tes oreilles et d'être attentif !${prompt}
  11316: |-
    De toute façon, protéger plusieurs nations est difficile. Tu es sans cesse en patrouille longue et solitaire à la frontière, au cas où une tempête soudaine balayerait ta paix durement gagnée.
    Mais sais-tu ce qu'il est plus facile de contrôler que les frontières ? L'information.
    L'étendue de ce qui est diffusé au public n'est rien de plus que la pointe boueuse de la lance massive de Zuug le Sauterel.${prompt}
  11317: Plus tu caches habilement cette intelligence désagréable, plus les citoyens se sentiront en sécurité. Cependant, même un petit point de vérité peut déchirer une nation s'il perce. C'est pourquoi il faut garder les choses sous couvert, tu vois.${prompt}
  11318: |-
    Comme le dit le vieil adage, l'ignorance est vraiment un bonheur.
    Bweheheheh.${prompt}
  11319: |-
    Et donc, c'est là que nous intervenons. Nous gérons les problèmes que le Duché et d'autres nations ne veulent pas salir leurs jolies petites mains gantées de blanc avec.
    Considère-nous comme des nettoyeurs de pont très non officiels - et très bien payés - bwehehehe.${prompt}
  11320: |-
    Bien sûr, cela signifie être aussi malveillant et froid que le vide d'où surgissent ces abominations.
    Et comme si peu connaissent notre existence, nous pouvons mener nos affaires à notre manière. Nous n'avons pas à nous soucier du bourbier politique que les gens appellent "diplomatie".${prompt}
  11321: 'En résumé : nous sommes un mal nécessaire.${prompt}'
  11322: |-
    En y réfléchissant, vous aventuriers n'êtes pas si différents de nous.
    Tant que tu peux récolter une récompense, tu feras ce qu'il faut sans même un roulement des yeux ; et c'est exactement le genre d'attitude dont nous avons besoin.${prompt}
  11323: Alors, qu'en dis-tu ? Veux-tu gagner un peu de monnaie en te faufilant dans les ombres ?${prompt}
  11324: |-
    S'enrôler dans l'opération ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, je suis intrigué.
    Non, c'est trop louche.${prompt}
  11325: |-
    Très bien, retourne te cacher derrière les jupes de ta mère si tu as si peur de l'obscurité.
    Mais ne va pas ouvrir grand ta grande bouche à propos de nous à qui que ce soit, sinon tu te réveilleras un matin sans aucune dent.
    Mais si jamais tu trouves plus de courage qu'un lapin, parle-moi à nouveau et peut-être trouverons-nous une utilité pour toi.${prompt}
  11326: Reviens donc à la charge, hein ?${prompt}
  11327: Une décision louable. Maintenant, fais attention, car je ne vais pas me répéter.${prompt}
  11328: Nous avons des agents stationnés à Kazham et Rabao--fais-leur une faveur et ils te le rendront.${prompt}
  11329: |-
    Quoi, déjà peur ? Je n'arrive même pas à penser à cause du bruit de tes genoux qui claquent, alors reprends-toi jusqu'à ce que j'aie fini.
    Je n'ai jamais dit que cela devait être une mission en solo, morveux.${prompt}
  11330: |-
    D'autres aventuriers se sont enrôlés avec nous, la plupart si forts qu'ils pourraient t'éviscérer avec un ongle. Chacun d'eux ferait un excellent compagnon. Autant j'aimerais te prouver ma force sur le champ de bataille, nous officiers sommes chargés uniquement de fournir les emplacements et les noms de tes cibles. Voilà.
    Oh, et tu ferais bien de montrer de l'initiative du début à la fin, sinon tu n'obtiendras rien des pyxides.${prompt}
  11331: J'entends dire que les récompenses pour l'accomplissement de ces tâches sont de véritables trésors aussi. Si jamais tu découvres un peu de courage dans ce cœur de poule que tu as, tu pourrais aussi te battre seul et garder tout pour toi.${prompt}
  11332: Ugh, j'en ai assez de cette gueule répugnante. Va-t'en et reviens quand tu auras vraiment accompli quelque chose.${prompt}
  11333: |-
    Halt ! Annule cet ordre !
    Je n'aime peut-être pas ta tête, mais tu auras besoin de ceci malgré tout.${prompt}
  11334: 'Même un novice comme toi sait à quoi ressemble ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}'
  11335: Il te suffit de le montrer à mes collègues à Kazham et Rabao.${prompt}
  11336: |-
    Je suis sûr que je n'ai pas besoin de dire à quelqu'un de ta stature légendaire que cela sert à appeler les Voidwalkers.
    Cependant, obtenir quelques ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} pourrait te donner un avantage... pas que ton altesse hautaine en aurait besoin.${prompt}
  11337: |-
    De plus, mes directives concernent uniquement les aspects discrets de ce commerce. Je ne vois pas de raison de me soucier des détails banals de nos opérations.
    Si tu souhaites risquer de te faire harceler avec de telles banalités, va voir un Officier de Voidwatch.${prompt}
  11338: |-
    Ah, te voilà.
    J'ai entendu parler de tes exploits à Kazham et Rabao. Peut-être que je t'ai mal jugé...${prompt}
  11339: |-
    Mais ne crois pas que tu as gagné notre confiance après deux missions insignifiantes.
    Reviens quand tu seras un peu plus expérimenté, et alors je pourrai avoir quelque chose pour toi.${prompt}
  11340: Pourquoi est-ce que je pense que ce travail te ferait pleurer en rentrant chez ta mère ? Parce que le patron l'a dit...en d'autres termes.${prompt}
  11341: Tu penses être un meilleur juge de tes propres capacités que le patron, hein ?${prompt}
  11342: Alors essaie de trouver un meilleur moyen d'attirer l'attention du patron.${prompt}
  11343: |-
    Comment fais-tu ça exactement ? Hahaha, ne me fais pas éclater de rire.
    Je pensais que tu te considérais comme un aventurier. Alors utilise ce demi-melon que tu appelles une tête et pense à quelque chose par toi-même.${prompt}
  11344: |-
    Dans notre monde, la persévérance est indispensable.
    Peu importe combien de vitriol je crache, tu continues à pleurer pour en avoir plus. Je peux critiquer ta gueule, mais pas ta détermination.${prompt}
  11345: |-
    Si tu veux que mon patron reconnaisse tes compétences, essaie de faire quelque chose digne d'un aventurier.
    Cela peut prendre un certain temps pour un morveux comme toi, mais mon patron n'est pas aveugle. Il finira par te remarquer.${prompt}
  11346: |-
    Quant à la manière de le faire remarquer, ce demi-melon que tu as devrait pouvoir le comprendre.
    Bonne chance. On dirait que tu en auras besoin.${prompt}
  11347: |-
    Ah, te voilà.
    J'ai entendu parler de tes exploits à Kazham et Rabao, et... eh bien, je suppose que je t'ai mal jugé.${prompt}
  11348: |-
    J'ai en ma possession un document demandant ta présence, signé par rien de moins que le chef lui-même.
    S'il reconnaît tes talents, qui suis-je pour les mettre en question.${prompt}
  11349: De toute façon, voyons de quoi il en retourne pour ta prochaine mission, d'accord ?${prompt}
  11350: |-
    As-tu entendu parler de l'histoire du palais aérien ?
    C'est là où tu te rendras.${prompt}
  11351: Comment diable devrais-je savoir ? En ce qui me concerne, ce n'est rien d'autre qu'une histoire de nourrice !${prompt}
  11352: J'ai entendu de nombreux récits du Proche-Orient sur des châteaux flottant sur la mer, mais un qui vole dans le ciel ? C'est de la folie !${prompt}
  11353: Le patron devrait pourtant avoir quelques réponses pour toi. Il t'attend dans ses quartiers, alors va le voir et cesse de tirer sur les moutons avec moi.${prompt}
  11354: Ahoy, ${name-player} ! C'est bon de te voir en bonne forme, mon ami.${prompt}
  11355: |-
    Je ne voulais pas te charger avec un autre de mes discours infâmes, mais quel genre de capitaine serais-je si j'envoyais mon équipage en mer sans une voile ni une rame ?
    Il te suffit de supporter un peu et je serai fini aussi vite que possible... mais je ne peux rien promettre, car quand tu as passé autant de temps entre le mât et la grand-voile que moi, le temps commence à signifier quelque chose de complètement différent.${prompt}
  11356: Tu vas bientôt partir pour "Sky". Oui, c'est bien ça. Tu'Lia sera ta destination.${prompt}
  11357: |-
    Ce n'est pas le Bibiki Bay ou la Péninsule Buburimu--à peine une âme connaît cet archipel éthéré.
    Pour aggraver les choses, tout le monde dans les ports de Vana'diel tremble à cause d'une peste invisible. Et je parie tout l'argent de Norg que Jeuno sait quelque chose à ce sujet que nous ignorons.${prompt}
  11358: |-
    Foutre des coquilles ! Si je ne savais pas mieux, je jurerais que ce n'est rien d'autre que les divagations d'un bosco maladroit.
    Arrrg, les jours où nous pirates étions le pire des maux du monde sont révolus, mon ami.${prompt}
  11359: |-
    Pourtant, il semble que nous dirigeons tous deux nos navires vers le même "X" sur la carte au trésor proverbiale pour le moment...
    Cependant, voyant à quel point nos plans sont aussi vastes que l'horizon, il vaut mieux ne pas fermer les yeux sur ces problèmes.${prompt}
  11360: |-
    Garde cette information sous le pont, si tu vois ce que je veux dire. La situation est déjà assez mauvaise sans que tout le continent se soulève.
    En tout cas, je veillerai à t'informer de tout nouveau développement si j'en entends parler. Tu peux compter là-dessus -- je te le jure sur ma propre planche et j'espère voler, mets une jambe en bois sur ma cuisse.${prompt}
  11361: |-
    J'ai oublié de mentionner quelque chose ! Tu gardes toujours ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, n'est-ce pas ?
    Je crois qu'il est censé éclore ou quelque chose comme ça si tu l'élèves correctement. Je ne suis pas trop sûr des détails, cependant.
    Mieux vaut que tu vérifies avec mon premier maître Kieran à ce sujet.${prompt}
  11362: |-
    Il connaît le reste des informations utiles -- arrrg, je veux dire des informations aptes. Peut-être ai-je vraiment une famille de corbeaux qui niche dans mon vieux nid de corbeaux.
    Que cette pierre te serve bien dans tes voyages, car tu pourrais être le seul espoir du royaume.${prompt}
  11363: Enfin, ne fais rien là-bas qu'un vieux loup de mer comme moi ne ferait pas, mon vieux.${prompt}
  11364: |-
    Oh, te voilà de retour.
    Le patron t'attend. Entre vite avant de mettre en colère moi et lui.${prompt}
  11365: D'abord, merci de faire ce qui doit être fait. Mon cœur est noyé de culpabilité de toujours te faire effectuer ces opérations sous-marines.${prompt}
  11366: Pourtant, tu es le seul en qui je peux avoir confiance. Avec tous ces matelots froussards à mon service -- aucun n'est digne de tenir une épée, si tu veux mon avis.${prompt}
  11367: '...Ce qui rend encore plus difficile de te dire que nous nous faisons tremper dans ce tourbillon du Marcheur du Vide, et nous prenons l'eau plus vite que nous pouvons la pomper. Nous ne savons toujours pas grand-chose sur cette tempête parfaite non plus, ce que je trouve plus étrange qu'un kraken en pleurs.${prompt}'
  11368: Les vents d'ouest apportent avec eux des histoires de destruction venant du Proche-Orient également.${prompt}
  11369: Malheureusement, mes mains sont liées et je n'ai pas le temps de descendre des canots pour nos voisins à l'est.${prompt}
  11370: C'est pourquoi je t'envoie. Je pensais que tu allais hisser les voiles et partir dès que tu entendrais ça de toute façon, et ce feu dans ton ventre est ce dont nous avons le plus besoin en ce moment.${prompt}
  11371: |-
    La violence se répand comme du beurre de Selbina sur du pain, et peu importe combien de démons tu abats, il n'y a pas de fin à eux.
    Nous n'avons pas la moindre idée de ce qui se passe.${prompt}
  11372: Tu es le lest qui garde Vana'diel droit, ${name-player}, et le royaume a besoin de toi plus que jamais. Cela peut ne pas valoir un grain de sel, venant d'un vieux marin bien installé dans ses quartiers de capitaine, mais ne tombe pas dans l'excès de bravoure.${prompt}
  11373: |-
    Eh bien, eh bien... il semble que tu aies un cercle d'acquaintances assez diversifié. Tu connais beaucoup de gens.
    C'est remarquable que tu aies réussi à établir des liens avec un pirate, parmi toutes les professions.${prompt}
  11374: |-
    Tout aussi impressionnant est que les humains aient pu placer un objet aussi monumental dans le ciel.
    Quel dommage que cette technologie ait été perdue au fil des âges. Échappée aux annales.${prompt}
  11375: Quoi qu'il en soit, le corsaire a raison d'affirmer que l'influence des intrus se répand. Elle étend ses tentacules.${prompt}
  11376: Tes efforts vaillants ont jusqu'à présent atténué la destruction, mais bientôt tu devras affronter le fléau dans le Passage des Échos. Une rencontre inévitable.${prompt}
  11377: Sous quelle forme ce fléau se manifeste-t-il, te demandes-tu ? Réfléchis à son identité ?${prompt}
  11378: |-
    Tu as traversé le royaume d'innombrables fois et confronté une myriade d'entités. Une pléthore de personnages.
    Alors peut-être que tu peux deviner ma réponse.
    Kupofried a proposé d'aider à révéler la véritable nature de cette menace, mais ces efforts se sont jusqu'à présent avérés infructueux.${prompt}
  11379: Nous sommes tous noyés dans une rivière d'ignorance. À tâtonner maladroitement dans un brouillard de malentendus.${prompt}
  11380: |-
    Lorsque la rivière sera à sec, je t'informerai immédiatement de toutes découvertes.
    Ce marin à la langue d'argent a exprimé un commentaire similaire, mais il mérite d'être répété. Sa répétition est justifiée.
    Ton habileté n'a jamais eu une telle importance comme elle en aura bientôt.${prompt}
  11381: Bien que les Marcheurs du Vide puissent être une préoccupation, n'as-tu pas d'autres projets à entreprendre ? Des horizons à explorer ?${prompt}
  11382: Les liens que tu formes avec les habitants de Vana'diel ne sont peut-être pas visibles, mais ils sont pertinents. Leur importance est palpable.${prompt}
  11383: Lorsque le moment sera venu, ces liens constitueront la source de ta force. Une fontaine de courage.${prompt}
  11384: |-
    Et sur cette note, nous devons nous séparer. Se disperser au vent.
    Puissions-nous nous rencontrer à nouveau, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11385: |-
    Toi encore ?
    Je n'arrive toujours pas à concevoir à quoi pourrait ressembler un palais aérien, mais il semble que le briefing du patron a été suffisant pour que tu te fasses une idée.${prompt}
  11386: |-
    Je suppose que je te laisse le voyage vers des lieux fantastiques et incompréhensibles.
    En tout cas, je te suggère de mettre tes priorités au clair pendant que tu le peux.${prompt}
  11387: |-
    Que vas-tu faire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Rien pour l'instant.
    Poser une série de questions.
    Participer aux opérations de Voidwatch.
    Demander un débriefing.
    Demander ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}
    Vérifier le stock de ${color: 5}voidstone${color: 1}.
    Demander la délivrance de la récompense.${prompt}
  11388: Comme je l'ai dit, je suis seulement ici pour te dire où et quoi. Je te laisse le jargon des nuages.${prompt}
  11389: |-
    Si tu as vraiment besoin de savoir quelque chose, cherche un truc... un Officier de Voidwatch. Oui, c'est lui qu'il faut demander. Je ne te l'ai pas déjà dit ?!
    N'oublie pas, ce n'est pas mon travail de m'occuper des détails insignifiants.${prompt}
  11390: Très bien alors, préparons-toi à partir immédiatement vers ce palais aérien.${prompt}
  11391: Quoi ? Tu pensais vraiment pouvoir simplement te pavaner là-haut sans remplir tes devoirs ? Je ne sais d'où tu viens, mais ici à Norg, il faut travailler pour obtenir ce que l'on veut ! D'abord, nous avons besoin de tes services dans la région de Li'Telor. Tu pourras étendre tes petites ailes et prendre le ciel après cela.${prompt}
  11392: |-
    Alors, où t'envoyer...
    Que dirais-tu du Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah, de l'Arbre Boyahda et... enfin mais non des moindres, de Ro'Maeve ? Ces trois juridictions devraient faire l'affaire.${prompt}
  11393: |-
    Pas besoin de te faire du souci pour leur ordre non plus. Simplement accomplir tes objectifs dans les secteurs désignés suffit pour moi.
    Oh oui, et assure-toi de me faire un rapport quand tu auras terminé. Malheureusement pour toi, je n'ai pas le pouvoir de lire dans les pensées des gens.${prompt}
  11394: Est-ce une moue de désobéissance sur ton visage ? Hah ! Je crache dans ta direction générale ! Vous, les aventuriers, êtes censés aimer l'aventure, non ? Sinon, pourquoi seriez-vous appelés "aventuriers" ? Maintenant va là-bas et rends le Voidwatch fier !${prompt}
  11395: |-
    Il faut admettre que je suis quelque peu hésitant à te conférer ce privilège, mais je suppose que tu l'as mérité.
    Oui, je dis que tu peux enfin partir pour ce continent aérien.
    Hmmm... ces noms sont-ils des codes ou quelque chose ? Je n'en ai jamais entendu parler ! Peut-être que tu les connais.${prompt}
  11396: 'Je suis dans le noir à ce sujet, mais le capitaine m'a assuré que ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avait accumulé suffisamment d'énergie. Apparemment, tu en auras besoin dans un avenir proche.${prompt}'
  11397: En avançant, tu seras envoyé dans les trois zones suivantes.${prompt}
  11398: Les Jardins de Ru'Aun, le Palais de Ve'Lugannon, et le Sanctuaire de Ru'Avitau. Ugh, je m'emmêle la langue rien qu'en essayant de dire tout cela.${prompt}
  11399: |-
    Tu te souviens encore de tout ça ?
    Bien. Alors, va-t-en.
    Comme toujours, fais-moi un rapport quand tu auras fini de fricasser tes ennemis.${prompt}
  11400: Et rapporte-moi un souvenir, d'accord ?${prompt}

    L'atmacite peut être décrite comme l'agglomération cristalline de l'âme d'une créature.

    Comme on ne peut jamais avoir trop de cruor, je vous encourage à être diligent dans son acquisition.${prompt}

    Dans des conditions normales, l'enrichissement de l'atmacite est un processus intensif qui exige des mains expérimentées.

  12233: La personne en charge me dit que je dois continuer à pêcher des subligaria et des leggings dans les eaux locales avant qu'il ne me laisse... peu importe. De toute façon, vous ne voulez pas entendre mes histoires déprimantes.${prompt}

    Oh, joie... vous avez réussi.

    Comme il est évident, ma passion brûlante pour l'aventure m'a poussé à rejoindre cette enquête sur les Terres du Milieu.
    En route, cependant, je <soupir> me suis perdu dans une grotte. Je me perds toujours.${prompt}
  12240: J'ai réussi à sortir en me souvenant de mettre ma main droite sur le mur et... pfff, vous vous en fichez.${prompt}
  12241: Finalement, j'ai erré ici. Avec tous ces artefacts étranges autour, ce n'est pas le pire endroit où je pouvais finir.${prompt}
  12242: Quoi, Anastase veut un rapport de ma part ?${prompt}
  12243: |-
    <Marmonnement> Je suppose que je n'ai pas le choix...
    Ça aurait l'air mal si vous rapportiez et que je ne le faisais pas.${prompt}

    Merci pour cela.
    Ça n'aide pas beaucoup, mais je prendrai ce que je peux avoir.${prompt}

    Anastase vous a demandé de m'apporter quelque chose ?
    Super--cela ne détournera pas mon attention de cette monotonie pendant longtemps, cependant.${prompt}
  12254: En dehors de la surveillance des points de repère, il n'y a pas grand-chose à faire ici. Juste la même routine fatiguante, semaine après semaine...${prompt}
  12255: Dites-lui que tout se passe bien, mais que j'ai vraiment besoin d'une pause.${prompt}

  12346: Vous voulez dire que vous n'êtes pas encore né ?${prompt}
  12347: Vous voulez dire que... vous n'êtes pas encore né ?${prompt}
  12348: Alors comment êtes-vous arrivé ici ?${prompt}
  12349: Je viens d'une époque lointaine dans le futur, où Vana'diel se trouve au bord du précipice — et le maître est le seul à pouvoir me guider.${prompt}
  12350: Alors vous voulez dire que ${name-player}... est ce maître dont vous parlez ?${prompt}
  12351: Et avec cette tenue que vous portez, je parierais que vous êtes né en Extrême-Orient.${prompt}
  12352: C'est exact. Je suis la gardienne du Sanctorium de Reisenjima et j'ai un lien fort avec les cieux en tant que grande prêtresse.${prompt}
  12353: Oh. Je sais que les détails de la foi orientale sont un peu étrangers pour nous, mais Altana reste une figure centrale même là-bas.${prompt}
  12354: Donc vous seriez une autorité religieuse, alors ?${prompt}
  12355: Et laissez-moi deviner. Le pouvoir des esprits vous a envoyé dans notre époque ?${prompt}
  12356: Ils m'ont laissée dériver pour que je puisse empêcher les ténèbres qui engloutissent mon époque.${prompt}  
  12357: Qu'est-ce que c'est alors ? Vous allez devoir être un peu plus clair.${prompt}
  12358: Cela signifie-t-il que les bêtes finissent par triompher ? Ou est-ce quelque chose de bien plus néfaste ?${prompt}
  12359: Maître, puis-je vous montrer notre réalité ?${prompt}
  12360: |-
    Comment réagissez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    C'est probablement le mieux.
    Il vaut mieux qu'ils ne sachent pas.${prompt}
  12361: Ahem ! Qui croyez-vous a risqué sa vie pour sauver votre élève de devenir un en-cas pour requins !?${prompt}
  12362: Selon votre volonté.${prompt}
  12363: À l'époque d'où je viens, Vana'diel est prise dans l'étau de la peur.${prompt}
  12364: Dans ma patrie, nous appelons cela « le Vide », un voile de ténèbres qui infecte tout ce qu'il touche.${prompt}
  12365: Le maître est notre unique lueur d'espoir. ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] a arrêté l'avancée d'une telle force sinistre autrefois, et nous sommes confiants que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] peut le faire à nouveau.${prompt}
  12366: Le maître et ${choice-player-gender}[ses/son] compagnons ont lutté sans relâche pour un avenir meilleur, et leur histoire est connue de tous avec le temps.${prompt}
  12367: De nombreux mois et années passèrent. Je suis venu dans ce monde et me suis entraîné assidûment sous la douce tutelle du maître. Pourtant, il ne fallut pas longtemps avant que le ciel commence à s'assombrir... à la fois au sens figuré et littéral.${prompt}
  12368: Il est descendu comme un épais miasme, étouffant la terre sous un voile de silence.${prompt}
  12369: J'ai regardé dans les yeux du maître et j'ai pu voir la vérité. Ma patrie n'était pas la seule victime. Quon, Mindartia, Adoulin...${prompt}
  12370: Les temps de la fin étaient sur nous, et tant l'homme que la Déesse étaient impuissants à les arrêter.${prompt}
  12371: Mais alors... comment avez-vous survécu ?${prompt}
  12372: Le maître et mon père se sont sacrifiés.${prompt}
  12373: Ma mère vient d'une île connue sous le nom de Reisenjima, le lieu où la bataille finale a eu lieu.${prompt}
  12374: Vaincre le Vide n'était qu'un fantasme. Tout ce que je pouvais faire, c'était ériger une barrière pour arrêter son avance.${prompt}
  12375: Une victoire pyrrhique, en effet, car les murs du sanctuaire de Reisenjima ne pouvaient que renvoyer mes propres cris solitaires.${prompt}
  12376: J'ai été prisonnier pendant plusieurs années, lorsque un esprit est descendu des cieux pour se poser sur un brasero à proximité.${prompt}
  12377: Elle m'a dit qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul éclat d'espoir qui pouvait nous sauver...${prompt}
  12378: Le maître. Je devais trouver le maître et unir ma lumière avec ${choice-player-gender}[la sienne/sa].${prompt}
  12379: Les esprits ont ouvert un chemin pour moi, me guidant ici... à ce moment précis de l'histoire de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12380: Maître, j'aimerais vous donner ceci, de peur d'oublier de le faire plus tard.${prompt}
  12381: D'après ce que vous m'avez dit, de nombreuses épreuves vous attendront avant que vous ne fouliez enfin le sol que vous connaissez aujourd'hui sous le nom d'Extrême-Orient.${prompt}
  12382: Gardez cela à vos côtés et le chemin restera toujours ouvert pour vous.${prompt}
  12383: Suivez ses indications et il vous mènera sans faute jusqu'à mon époque. Cependant...${prompt}
  12384: Attendez une minute. Si nous le suivons simplement sans rien faire d'autre, nous finirons juste par arriver dans votre futur apocalyptique où vous êtes le seul survivant, non ?${prompt}
  12385: '...C'est exact. Cependant, le maître a sûrement la capacité de vivre les deux futurs... un avec le Vide, et un sans.${prompt}'
  12386: S'il vous plaît... trouvez un moyen de... de...${prompt}
  12387: Je ne peux pas... rester... longtemps...${prompt}
  12388: Que diable--!?${prompt}
  12389: ${name-player}, je n'arrive pas à comprendre tout cela. Pensez-vous qu'elle dit la vérité ?${prompt}
  12390: Cela mérite une étude plus approfondie. Je vais voir si mes agents peuvent repérer quelque chose.${prompt}
  12391: <Soupir> Je n'ai jamais été très bon pour gérer des twists complexes.${prompt}
  12392: Donnez-moi un peu de temps pour rassembler mes pensées.${prompt}
  12393: Peut-être y a-t-il quelque chose dans ce conte qu'Iroha a raconté. Il y a de plus en plus d'étrangetés qui se produisent dernièrement.${prompt}
  12394: Toutes sortes de bêtes jamais vues auparavant... des gens se perdant dans des endroits qui semblent familiers mais sont d'une manière ou d'une autre un peu décalés... et bien d'autres choses que je pourrais mentionner.${prompt}
  12395: Au début, je pensais que les hommes-bêtes étaient derrière tout cela, mais maintenant je n'en suis plus si sûr.${prompt}
  12396: Nous devons faire le point sur la situation et trouver des éléments communs.${prompt}
  12397: Idéalement, vous voudriez parler à ma fille, Lion.${prompt}
  12398: Un peu garçon manqué, celle-là, mais il n'y a personne dans les Terres du Milieu qui puisse égaler ses compétences en matière de déduction.${prompt}
  12399: Il y a juste la petite question de savoir où elle a encore disparu cette fois-ci.${prompt}
  12400: Elle est partie d'ici il y a quelques jours, affirmant que le meilleur moyen de connaître les plans de la Confédération des hommes-bêtes était de sonder les alliés dans les trois nations.${prompt}
  12401: Il est donc logique qu'elle soit soit à Bastok, soit à San d'Oria, soit à Windurst.${prompt}
  12402: Vous pourriez donc la croiser au cours de certaines missions liées aux hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  12403: Retournez dans votre nation d'origine et suivez d'abord cette menace.${prompt}
  12404: Normalement, je confierais cela à ma fille, Lion...${prompt}
  12405: Elle était un peu garçon manqué, et il n'y avait personne de mieux qu'elle pour découvrir des choses.${prompt}
  12406: |-
    Mais maintenant elle est... elle est...
    Eh bien, peut-être que vous pouvez trouver quelque chose que nous ne pouvons pas.${prompt}

  12410: Une voix, vous dites ? Je n'ai entendu aucun bruit.${prompt}
  12411: Mais bon, si vous le dites, c'est que vous avez probablement entendu quelque chose. Espérons que cela vous a donné un indice--ce qui est bien mieux que ce que je peux faire.${prompt}
  12412: Au moins, Lion a un œil avisé pour ce genre de choses.${prompt}
  12413: Elle reprend lentement des forces, mais il n'est pas rare qu'elle passe toute la matinée au lit non plus...${prompt}

  12417: Vous êtes de retour !${prompt}
  12418: Iroha a fait les cent pas toute la journée.${prompt}
  12419: Maître, les récits de votre victoire contre le Seigneur des Ombres ont atteint nos oreilles !${prompt}
  12420: L'histoire est un combat plus proche de reprendre son cours correct.${prompt}
  12421: '...et nous rapproche aussi de l'oubli.${prompt}'
  12422: Mais nous pouvons d'abord amener l'histoire au point où le maître sera en mesure d'affronter l'avenir.${prompt}
  12423: Je suppose.${prompt}
  12424: À mon retour, j'ai passé des heures à réfléchir aux paroles du maître, et quelque chose a commencé à me tracasser.${prompt}
  12425: Je n'arrive pas à me défaire du sentiment que c'est lié à ce que Dame Lion a prophétisé en Escha concernant le rôle du maître dans la bataille à venir contre les ténèbres.${prompt}
  12426: Quelque chose à propos de votre orbe qui doit gagner en lumière ?${prompt}
  12427: Correct. Nous devons créer un monde dans lequel le maître pourra se battre.${prompt}
  12428: Et qu'est-ce qui vous dérange là-dedans ?${prompt}
  12429: Pensez à votre lutte contre le Seigneur des Ombres.${prompt}
  12430: Lorsque nous nous sommes rencontrés pour la première fois, il y a plusieurs années, le maître a mentionné quelque chose qui s'est passé ce jour-là.${prompt}
  12431: « Je sentais le cristal résonner en moi. »${prompt}
  12432: S'il vous plaît, essayez de vous souvenir.${prompt}
  12433: Guerrier du Cristal--celui qui sera connu sous le nom de Guerrier de la Lumière...${prompt}
  12434: 'Vous ${choice: 1}[avez voyagé/voyagerez] à travers terre, mer et ciel, baigné dans la lumière et arrêtant les ténèbres chaque fois qu'elles menacent les vivants.${prompt}'
  12435: Et vous continuerez à bannir le doute qui réside en vous.${prompt}
  12436: Bannissez le doute qui se cache en vous et laissez la radiance remplir votre âme.${prompt}
  12437: De tels voyages laissent des séquelles sur les mortels ordinaires, qui retournent chez eux et vivent le reste de leur vie dans le confort.${prompt}
  12438: Mais bien que vous puissiez vous arrêter brièvement pour rassembler vos esprits, chaque fois que vous le faites, c'est uniquement pour renforcer votre résolution pour le prochain combat.${prompt}
  12439: Vous avez la volonté de protéger les opprimés, d'agacer les ténèbres et de protéger tout ce que détient Altana.${prompt}
  12440: Le moment est venu pour vous de devenir plus qu'un simple guerrier.${prompt}
  12441: |-
    Vous deviendrez plus grand...${wait-36: 1}
    Car c'est ce qui est attendu de vous.${prompt}
  12442: Est-ce que cela vous est revenu, Maître ?${prompt}
  12443: Vous avez évoqué avec révérence ces mots, en disant qu'ils vous avaient donné la force spirituelle nécessaire pour continuer malgré les obstacles.${prompt}
  12444: Bien que vos voyages aient été ardus et semés de périls, l'éclat dans vos yeux en racontant vos histoires m'a donné du courage.${prompt}
  12445: La raison pour laquelle vous avez pu nous guider dans la lutte finale est précisément à cause des nombreux obstacles que vous avez surmontés.${prompt}
  12446: Vous m'avez appris que le monde valait la peine de se battre, peu importe à quel point l'avenir était sombre.${prompt}
  12447: Mon père parlait toujours de vous avec adoration, croyant que vous étiez un ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] de courage indiscutable.${prompt}
  12448: Bannissez votre doute, Maître, afin que vous puissiez devenir tout ce que vous étiez destiné à être !${prompt}
  12449: Vous avez conquis beaucoup de choses, et le moment est venu de vous remplir de radiance !${prompt}
  12450: Maintenant que vous en parlez, Iroha, qui est donc ce père dont vous parlez ?${prompt}
  12451: Eh bien...${prompt}
  12452: Patron !!! Quelque chose de terrible est arrivé !${prompt}
  12453: Il y a de gros problèmes à la Grotte du Serpent de Mer !${prompt}
  12454: Les bateaux tournent en rond et personne ne peut partir !${prompt}
  12455: Aucun bateau n'arrive à atteindre Norg !${prompt}
  12456: Il y avait ce bruit infernal de carillons et les bateaux tournent en place !${prompt}
  12457: Vous voulez dire que tout cela a commencé en même temps ?${prompt}
  12458: '...Attendez. “Tourner en rond...” “Tourner en place...”${prompt}'
  12459: Évidemment, tout cela est causé par la même chose.${prompt}
  12460: La cloche...${prompt}
  12461: Cela signifie-t-il que vous savez quelque chose, Zeid ? ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12462: |-
    Une idée ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je ne suis pas sûr...
    Juste comme à Escha...${prompt}
  12463: ${name-player}, réfléchissez. Nous avons entendu quelque chose de similaire à Escha, à l'endroit qui ressemblait au Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah.${prompt}
  12464: Exactement. J'ai la même pensée.${prompt}
  12465: Ah. Donc si vous deux avez vécu la même chose, il n'y a personne de mieux pour comprendre ce qui se passe.${prompt}
  12466: Nous devrions nous rendre à la grotte, ${name-player}, mais il sera plus rapide si nous nous séparons. Je vais avancer pendant que vous vous préparez.${prompt}
  12467: Maître, je tiens à vous accompagner !${prompt}
  12468: Zeid m'a parlé de la manière dont vous avez résolu notre petit problème.${prompt}
  12469: Cela me préoccupe qu'Iroha ne soit pas la seule à venir du futur.${prompt}
  12470: Peut-être qu'elle pourrait répondre à certaines de nos questions...${prompt}
  12471: Si elle était encore ici.${prompt}
  12472: Mais Aldo a peut-être trouvé quelqu'un qui peut nous aider de toute façon. N'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12473: J'ai réussi à trouver quelqu'un qui connaît le Sanctuaire de Reisenjima.${prompt}
  12474: ${name-player}, avez-vous fait la connaissance de quelqu'un connu sous le nom de Tenzen ?${prompt}
  12475: |-
    Vous connaissez Tenzen ?
    ${selection-lines}

    Non.${prompt}

  12477: 'Je vois. ${choice: 0}[Alors je n'ai guère besoin de vous rappeler qu'il/Peut-être que le nom en lui-même le révèle, mais il] est un guerrier venant de l'Extrême-Orient.${prompt}'
  12478: Il y a quelque temps, il est apparu à Jeuno pour demander de l'aide au Duc Vicarious... quelque chose à propos d'une “Vide” menaçant de dévorer sa patrie.${prompt}
  12479: Cette chose du Vide doit sûrement avoir un lien avec le futur dont parlait Iroha.${prompt}
  12480: En effet. Rappelez-vous, ${name-player}, que Siren a mentionné un futur sans temps ?${prompt}
  12481: Mais revenons à ce Tenzen... où est-il ?${prompt}
  12482: On dit qu'il a terminé ses affaires ici et est retourné dans son pays natal.${prompt}
  12483: Il voyage à travers les Terres du Milieu, mais je ne peux pas vous en dire plus.${prompt}
  12484: Je demande à mes hommes de se renseigner.${prompt}
  12485: Bon travail, Aldo. Voyez ce que vous pouvez découvrir.${prompt}
  12486: Même si nous réussissons à le trouver, ${name-player}, nous ne pouvons pas être sûrs qu'il aura des réponses.${prompt}
  12487: Mais nous ne saurons pas avant de le trouver.${prompt}
  12488: En attendant, je vais continuer à apprendre ce que je peux sur notre imposteur Zi'Tah.${prompt}
  12489: Voici un petit quelque chose de Jeuno. Puissiez-vous trouver des réponses... des réponses dont nous avons besoin maintenant plus que jamais...${prompt}

  12668: Yar, Iroha m'a déjà donné les infos.${prompt}
  12669: Alors tu pars rencontrer les anciens, hein ?${prompt}
  12670: 'Alors ce que je vais te dire est le même qu'auparavant : tu dois aller au Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}'
  12671: Ce n'est pas trop loin, et si tu y es déjà allé une fois, ça ne devrait pas poser de problème de refaire le trajet.${prompt}
  12672: Le meilleur endroit pour les contacter serait au Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}
  12673: Ce n'est qu'à un petit pas.${prompt}
  12674: Le meilleur endroit pour trouver ce que tu cherches serait au Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}
  12675: Mais n'as-tu pas besoin de faire une escale à Kazham d'abord ?${prompt}
  12676: Sir Gilgamesh, j'ai peur que nous en sachions peu sur ce temple dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  12677: C'est un peu à l'est, au-delà de la Jungle de Yuhtunga, au plus profond des recoins de la Jungle de Yhoator.${prompt}
  12678: Il est certain que vous voudrez quelques-uns de mes meilleurs hommes pour vous accompagner. Ce serait dommage de vous perdre.${prompt}
  12679: Ce serait un atout.${prompt}
  12680: Maître, retrouvons-nous au temple.${prompt}
  12681: Je me réjouis de l'occasion de rencontrer un Kuluu.${prompt}
  12682: ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Seigneur] ${name-player}, peut-être avez-vous quelques affaires non terminées à régler d'abord. Nous allons explorer en avant.${prompt}
  12683: Je vous en prie, terminez vos tâches sans délai.${prompt}
  12684: ${name-player}, pourquoi ce regard sombre ? Tout le monde attend de vous des conseils, alors gardez le moral !${prompt}
  12685: Hé, Zeid, ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] n'est pas le seul. Ma tête tourne de souci ces derniers jours.${prompt}
  12686: C'est à propos d'Escha, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12687: J'ai demandé à l'un de mes amis les plus fiables de voir ce qu'il pouvait trouver.${prompt}
  12688: Le mystère devient plus profond chaque jour. Plus il passait de temps dans Escha, plus il commençait à parler en langues et à découvrir des connaissances que personne ne devrait avoir.${prompt}
  12689: Cela nous a tous effrayés.${prompt}
  12690: Hmmm ?${prompt}
  12691: Et parlant du loup. Atori-Tutori, comment se passe ta recherche ?${prompt}
  12692: Vous m'avez demandé d'aller à Escha - Ru'Aun, et c'est exactement ce que j'ai fait.${prompt}
  12693: Endroit étrange, celui-là. Le passé et le futur sont tout embrouillés.${prompt}
  12694: Je crois que je comprends. C'est un endroit où le temps n'existe pas.${prompt}
  12695: Que voulez-vous dire, « n'existe pas » ?${prompt}
  12696: Notre petite amie Siren en parlait.${prompt}
  12697: Nous ne pouvons qu'espérer que d'autres vortex ne surgissent pas. Espérons que Siren pourra comprendre quelque chose.${prompt}
  12698: L'avez-vous cherchée ?${prompt}
  12699: Non. Mais elle est partie affronter l'ambassadeur, alors espérons qu'elle lui donnera ce qu'il mérite.${prompt}
  12700: Ce type de samouraï bizarre parlait sans fin de voir Siren dans la Côte de Misareaux.${prompt}
  12701: Ce n'est pas juste une curiosité passagère. Deux de ces demoiselles ?${prompt}
  12702: Deux demoiselles ?${prompt}
  12703: Oho, peut-être que “demoiselles” est un terme un peu trop sévère pour une personne de telles manières féminines.${prompt}
  12704: Ce n'est pas vraiment ce que je voulais dire.${prompt}
  12705: Mais s'il y en a deux, ne serait-il pas raisonnable de penser qu'il s'agit d'une autre anomalie causée par les ténèbres ?${prompt}
  12706: Qui sait ? Il est possible que mes yeux me jouent des tours.${prompt}
  12707: Tout est possible étant donné ce que nous savons d'Escha jusqu'à présent.${prompt}
  12708: Et en parlant d'Escha, nous pouvons y retourner depuis ce nouveau vortex.${prompt}
  12709: |-
    Escha - Ru'Aun...
    J'ai entendu dire qu'un autre individu masqué venait et repartait de là-bas.${prompt}
  12710: Vous savez comment sont Tenzen et Iroha : dès qu'ils entendent parler de quelque chose de vaguement dangereux, ils foncent pour se battre plus vite qu'un chocobo poursuivant des gysahl greens.${prompt}
  12711: Et connaissant votre façon de faire, ${name-player}, vous serez juste derrière eux. Promettez simplement de revenir si les choses deviennent incontrôlables.${prompt}
  12712: Je dois être d'accord avec lui. Il ne faut pas être voyant pour lire les mauvais présages là-bas.${prompt}
  12713: Tout le maudit endroit est aussi silencieux que la mort elle-même.${prompt}
  12714: D'autant plus raison pour des héros comme moi de sauver ce qui doit l'être !${prompt}
  12715: Maintenant qu'il est parti, Gilgamesh... qui est-il vraiment ?${prompt}
  12716: Juste un homme avec des connexions spéciales avec les Tenshodo.${prompt}
  12717: Il est peut-être un peu dodu autour du ventre, mais il n'y a pas un aventurier dans le monde qui n'ait pas--ou ne le fera pas--croiser son chemin.${prompt}
  12718: Même le vieux Maat à Jeuno respecte ce gars.${prompt}
  12719: Est-ce vraiment le cas ?${prompt}
  12720: Et ${name-player}--si vous voulez devenir un peu plus fort vous-même, je vous recommande de parler à Maat avant d'aller à Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt}
  12721: Si vous dites que nous pouvons lui faire confiance, alors je n'ai aucune raison de douter. Allons à Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt}
  12722: Je ne sais pas si Prishe et Tenzen sont en train de nettoyer les ponts, mais ils ne sont sûrement pas ici.${prompt}
  12723: Le patron ne peut rien faire sans eux, alors il vaudrait mieux revenir un peu plus tard.${prompt}
  12724: Hé, ${name-player}. Devine qui est arrivé ?${prompt}
  12725: Hé hé ! J'ai décidé de me joindre à la fête.${prompt}
  12726: Je sais que vous êtes tous impatients concernant votre futur sombre et désespéré, mais c'est le présent qui a vraiment mis le feu sous mon derrière.${prompt}
  12727: Et allez. Je ne vais pas vous laisser monopoliser tout le plaisir.${prompt}
  12728: Il se passe tellement de choses ces derniers temps que je ne peux m'empêcher de me demander si nous ne devrions pas nous préoccuper davantage du “maintenant” que du “plus tard”.${prompt}
  12729: Alors j'espérais pouvoir apporter mon aide à la cause.${prompt}
  12730: Gilgamesh m'a informé de ce qui s'est passé après l'histoire d'Iroha à Jeuno.${prompt}
  12731: Gilgamesh a eu la gentillesse de m'expliquer ce qui s'est passé après notre départ de Jeuno.${prompt}
  12732: Passer en revue chaque détail aurait tué ma voix, mais j'ai veillé à couvrir les parties importantes.${prompt}
  12733: 'Et je dois admettre--elle ${choice: 1}[et Lion /]a bien fait son travail en veillant sur Iroha.${prompt}'
  12734: Iroha est vraiment une battante. Il faut admirer son courage !${prompt}
  12735: Je suis juste content qu'Iroha se soit bien rétablie.${prompt}
  12736: Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Seigneur] ${name-player}. Heureux de vous voir en bonne forme.${prompt}
  12737: Je suppose que vous avez réussi à rencontrer Selh'teus ?${prompt}
  12738: Pardonnez-moi pour ce qui s'est passé plus tôt.${prompt}
  12739: Mettons cela derrière nous pour discuter de ce que vous avez appris de lui.${prompt}
  12740: Un nouveau cristal va naître à Reisenjima !?${prompt}
  12741: Enfin, une lumière pour percer les nuages !${prompt}
  12742: Maintenant cela pourrait éclaircir toute votre histoire de “Vide”, hein, Tenzen ? Victoire tout autour !${prompt}
  12743: L'histoire de Sir Selh'teus à propos du cristal... ça ne colle pas.${prompt}
  12744: Si je me souviens bien, le cristal n'apparaît pas maintenant, mais plutôt plusieurs années plus tard.${prompt}
  12745: Alors si l'histoire doit se dérouler ainsi, pourquoi...${prompt}
  12746: '...Pourquoi cela serait-il changé maintenant ? Son arrivée est supposée être bien après que le Vide ait été repoussé.${prompt}'
  12747: J'ai peur de comment l'avenir pourrait changer.${prompt}
  12748: Mais si c'est la méthode pour sauver l'Extrême-Orient, alors nous avons une responsabilité de la mener à bien !${prompt}
  12749: Voulez-vous dire que nous devons abandonner tout espoir !?${prompt}
  12750: Ce vieux a raison. Si le Vide a une emprise sur l'avenir, alors nous devons tout faire pour lui couper les bras !${prompt}
  12751: Donc le cristal apparaît quelques années plus tôt. Quelle est la grande affaire ?${prompt}
  12752: Cela me préoccupe simplement.${prompt}
  12753: Même si le cristal est là à mon époque, les ténèbres omniprésentes l'emportent encore.${prompt}
  12754: Le cristal seul n'est pas suffisant pour nous sauver.${prompt}
  12755: Alors nous devons trouver une solution qui attaque la racine du problème.${prompt}
  12756: Eh bien, vieux compagnon, il semble que ton voyage n'est pas tout à fait terminé.${prompt}
  12757: Eh bien, Tenzen, tu auras encore besoin de frapper fort, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12758: Bien sûr, tu as peut-être arrêté le Vide, mais il reste encore un peu de ténèbres à repousser.${prompt}
  12759: Le moment de ranger ton épée n'est pas encore arrivé, Tenzen.${prompt}
  12760: Même si le Vide a été arrêté, Vana'diel a encore besoin de tes services.${prompt}
  12761: J'avais longtemps pensé qu'il faudrait des années avant que les choses reviennent à la normale.${prompt}
  12762: Mais le cristal de Selh'teus est un grand pas dans la bonne direction.${prompt}
  12763: Mais, Sir Tenzen, quelque chose me dérange encore.${prompt}
  12764: Si je me souviens bien, le cristal n'apparaît pas maintenant, mais plutôt plusieurs années plus tard.${prompt}
  12765: Si le cristal devait se manifester maintenant, alors l'avenir serait irrévocablement modifié.${prompt}
  12766: Mais n'est-ce pas exactement ce que nous désirons ?${prompt}
  12767: Donc le cristal apparaît quelques années plus tôt. Quelle est la grande affaire ?${prompt}
  12768: Ne devrions-nous pas être contents que le problème puisse être résolu avant même qu'il ne commence ?${prompt}
  12769: Peut-être.${prompt}
  12770: Pourtant, même si le cristal est là à mon époque, les ténèbres omniprésentes l'emportent encore.${prompt}
  12771: Le cristal seul n'est pas suffisant pour nous sauver.${prompt}
  12772: Peu importe combien nous nous cognerons la tête contre le problème, nous ne trouvons pas de bonne solution.${prompt}
  12773: Je serais damné si nous ne passons pas à côté de quelque chose... Qu'est-ce qui cause le Vide ?${prompt}
  12774: Je ne comprends pas ce qui pourrait être faux.${prompt}
  12775: Nous passons clairement à côté de quelque chose. Pensez-vous que Bahamut pourrait avoir les réponses que nous cherchons ?${prompt}
  12776: Dame Prishe, veuillez continuer à chercher des indices.${prompt}
  12777: '''Bien sûr !${prompt}'
  12778: Bien sûr.${prompt}
  12779: '...Maître.${prompt}'
  12780: Veuillez donner votre avis sur le plan du cristal de Selh'teus.${prompt}
  12781: |-
    Que pensez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je pense que plus tôt est mieux.
    Nous devrions être prudents.
    Je ferai tout pour rencontrer Altana.${prompt}
  12782: Si cela signifie résoudre les problèmes en Extrême-Orient, alors je suis tout à fait pour.${prompt}
  12783: Et c'est aussi bon pour les affaires.${prompt}
  12784: Alors récapitulons, hmm ?${prompt}
  12785: Iroha est-elle opposée au plan de Selh'teus, hmm ?${prompt}
  12786: Vous et Iroha êtes opposés au plan de Selh'teus, hmm ?${prompt}
  12787: “Opposé” est peut-être un mot trop fort. Je demanderais simplement que nous procédions avec la plus grande prudence.${prompt}
  12788: Je crois que nous pouvons faire confiance à Siren quand elle dit que le cristal en Extrême-Orient est intimement lié à ce problème.${prompt}
  12789: Nous devons bannir le Vide autour de Reisenjima pour avoir une chance de rencontrer Altana...${prompt}
  12790: 'Cela doit être la raison pour laquelle Siren nous a donné le ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  12791: Et l'orbe que j'ai confiée au Maître reste cruciale.${prompt}
  12792: C'est un artefact inestimable du Sanctorium de Reisenjima qui lie le porteur avec le cristal-mère.${prompt}
  12793: Personne ne se perd lorsqu'il suit ses directives.${prompt}
  12794: Nous ne devrions pas nous précipiter dans une décision incertaine, mais plutôt attendre un signe.${prompt}
  12795: Eh bien, ${name-player}, si vous êtes d'accord, alors nous devons adopter une autre approche.${prompt}
  12796: À savoir, en savoir plus sur cette bête qui vole l'énergie des cristaux.${prompt}
  12797: Et si Selh'teus veut que vous trouviez quelqu'un avec “un pouvoir absolu sur la magie”...${prompt}
  12798: Alors il n'y a qu'une personne à laquelle je pense.${prompt}
  12799: Cette vieille sorcière, Shantotto !${prompt}
  12800: Bien sûr, la vieille... enfin, Shantotto !${prompt}
  12801: Je suis réticent à le dire, mais peut-être parlait-il de Docteur Shantotto.${prompt}
  12802: Je... ne suis pas sûr que amener Iroha soit la meilleure idée.${prompt}
  12803: Pourquoi cela ?${prompt}
  12804: Si elle découvrait que vous venez du futur, elle vous examinerait, vous disséquerait et pourrait même vous vivisecter.${prompt}
  12805: '${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Seigneur] ${name-player}, nous avons notre prochaine destination : les Murs de Windurst.${prompt}'
  12806: Apportez-moi un cadeau !${prompt}
  12807: Bonne chance !${prompt}
  12808: Pourrait-il être que celui qui essaie de voler l'énergie des cristaux ne soit pas l'ambassadeur, mais...?${prompt}
  12809: Maître !${prompt}
  12810: Les papillons dans mon ventre se sont calmés en sachant que vous allez bien.${prompt}
  12811: Quelle histoire horrifiante...${prompt}
  12812: Alors ce Balamor essayait de créer un monde pour lui, et lui seul.${prompt}
  12813: Et il utilisait l'ambassadeur pour y parvenir ?${prompt}
  12814: Je ne sais pas s'il est un maître ou un imbécile.${prompt}
  12815: Je me souviens que le Maître m'a raconté des histoires sur la façon dont ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] a rencontré Balamor dans ${choice-player-gender}[ses/ses] aventures à travers l'Ulbuka oriental.${prompt}
  12816: J'ai entendu des contes de ce genre de spectre en Ulbuka oriental.${prompt}
  12817: Cela pourrait encore être un autre aspect de l'histoire que j'ai changé en venant ici.${prompt}
  12818: Et maintenant la question importante. ${name-player}, que faire de l'ambassadeur ?${prompt}
  12819: |-
    Que s'est-il passé avec l'ambassadeur ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je ne sais pas.
    Il est peut-être encore enchaîné.
    Il pourrait s'être échappé.${prompt}
  12820: La question est de savoir s'il réside toujours dans le vortex, ou s'il a réussi à s'échapper...${prompt}
  12821: Ne pas savoir où il se trouve constitue un véritable obstacle pour avancer.${prompt}
  12822: Eh bien, je dirais ceci : si le vortex de ce Balamor a disparu, je parie des gil aux raisins que les liens qui le retenaient se sont également évaporés.${prompt}
  12823: D'un côté “positif”, cela nous a peut-être donné plus de temps pour illuminer cet orbe.${prompt}
  12824: Eh bien, je dirais ceci : si le vortex de ce Balamor a disparu, je parie des gil aux raisins que les liens qui le retenaient se sont également évaporés.${prompt}
  12825: D'un côté “positif”, cela nous a peut-être donné plus de temps pour illuminer cet orbe.${prompt}
  12826: Si tel est le cas, il pourrait tenter une nouvelle attaque contre vous, Maître.${prompt}
  12827: J'espère juste que nous pourrons illuminer cet orbe à temps !${prompt}
  12828: De toute façon, il n'est pas nécessaire que vous soyez imprudents. Si Selh'teus vous a appelé à Al'Taieu, c'est là que vous devriez probablement vous rendre.${prompt}
  12829: Je suis d'accord.${prompt}
  12830: Maître, allons vers le cristal-mère.${prompt}
  12831: Je vous y retrouverai.${prompt}
  12832: |-
    ${name-player} !?
    ${name-player} !${prompt}
  12833: Je savais qu'il en faudrait plus pour abattre mon vieux pote !${prompt}
  12834: Oh, je suis si content que vous soyez revenu sain et sauf !${prompt}
  12835: Je pensais que ça prendrait plus que ça pour vous abattre !${prompt}
  12836: Vous vous souvenez de ce qui s'est passé, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12837: Là-bas à Al'Taieu, vous avez affronté l'ambassadeur, et il vous a laissé pour mort !${prompt}
  12838: '...Ou du moins c'est ce que j'ai entendu. Pas comme si j'étais réellement là pour voir tout cela.${prompt}'
  12839: Iroha nous a tout raconté.${prompt}
  12840: Elle a tenté d'appeler le pouvoir de Phoenix pour que vous reveniez parmi nous.${prompt}
  12841: Mais vous avez commencé à disparaître—votre corps disparaissant dans le vide.${prompt}
  12842: <Soupir> Iroha a dit que son cœur a sauté quelques milliers de battements, et nous avons tout fait pour la calmer.${prompt}
  12843: Vana'diel est un endroit étrange. Iroha est venue me voir en rêve et m'a raconté ce qui s'était passé.${prompt}
  12844: Elle a tenté d'appeler le pouvoir de Phoenix pour que vous reveniez parmi nous.${prompt}
  12845: Elle a dit que votre corps a commencé à disparaître dans le vide.${prompt}
  12846: Au début, je pensais que c'était un tas de balivernes, mais par tous les saints si vous n'êtes pas là devant nous maintenant.${prompt}
  12847: Je... je ne sais pas si je dois rire ou pleurer.${prompt}
  12848: Je ne sais pas si je dois rire ou pleurer !${prompt}
  12849: Je comprends ce sentiment.${prompt}
  12850: |-
    Mais je me disais, “Gilgamesh, il n'est pas question que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] meure comme ça !”
    Alors je suis parti à votre recherche.${prompt}
  12851: 'C'est pourquoi je t'ai envoyé cette lettre, ${choice: 3}[Aphmau/Nashmeira].${prompt}'
  12852: Je ne pouvais imaginer un choc plus grand... alors j'ai tiré quelques ficelles pour arriver ici.${prompt}
  12853: Et je suis tellement heureux de pouvoir te revoir !${prompt}
  12854: Ça a été un tel choc ! Mais j'ai arrangé les choses et j'ai demandé à Ovjang de faire partir les gens avec des excuses vagues pour que je puisse me dépêcher d'arriver ici.${prompt}
  12855: Et je suis tellement content d'avoir fait ça !${prompt}
  12856: Alors je me suis dit, “Gilgamesh, il n'y a pas moyen que ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] meure comme ça !”${prompt}
  12857: Alors j'ai envoyé des lettres à tout le monde à qui je pouvais penser !${prompt}
  12858: Laisse-moi te dire -- personne n'est plus heureux que moi !${prompt}
  12859: L'un de nous doit aller dire à Iroha !${prompt}

  12863: Je... j'aimerais bien le savoir.${prompt}
  12864: Je suis sûr qu'Iroha aimerait entendre la nouvelle.${prompt}
  12865: Mais si elle n'est pas ici... où pourrait-elle être ?${prompt}
  12866: Nous devons dire à Iroha que tu es réveillé !${prompt}
  12867: Mais où est-elle allée ?${prompt}
  12868: Tout ce qu'il reste à faire, c'est dire à Iroha la bonne nouvelle...${prompt}
  12869: Mais personne ne sait où elle est allée.${prompt}
  12870: Dans mon rêve, elle était devant le cristal, entourée d'une étrange lueur.${prompt}
  12871: Ça doit être lié à Reisenjima.${prompt}
  12872: Dans mon rêve, elle était devant le cristal, entourée de cette étrange lueur.${prompt}
  12873: La seule conclusion que nous pouvons tirer est que cela a quelque chose à voir avec Reisenjima.${prompt}
  12874: Mais avec toute l'Emptiness dans les mers orientales, il est impossible d'y accéder.${prompt}
  12875: J'ai demandé à Zeid et aux Tenshodo de faire des recherches pour voir si Iroha pourrait se trouver quelque part sur les autres continents.${prompt}
  12876: Oh, ne fais pas cette tête.${prompt}
  12877: Maintenant que tu es avec nous, l'avenir est plus radieux que jamais.${prompt}
