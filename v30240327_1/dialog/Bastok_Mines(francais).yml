    Quoi qu'il en soit, laissez-moi expliquer.
    Vous avez peut-être remarqué que ces foyers de synergie sont un peu encombrants, pour ne pas dire plus.${prompt}

    Ce n'est pas un grand souci quand on synergise ici en ville, mais c'est loin d'être adapté à la vie itinérante d'un aventurier.
    C'est alors que ça m'a frappée !${prompt}
  10420: |-
    Vous avez sûrement lu les histoires.
    À l'époque de la Guerre des Cristaux, il y avait des érudits capables de faire apparaître et disparaître des tomes massifs en un clin d'œil.
    Comment s'appelaient-ils déjà...? Tête-de-livre ? Vers-œuf ?${prompt}
  10421: |-
    Mais ce n'est pas leur nom qui est important. Non, c'est la technique qu'ils utilisaient pour stocker et invoquer leurs bibliothèques !
    "Éclair mystique" ou quelque chose comme ça ? Bref !${prompt}
  10422: Alors, je me suis dit, si seulement je pouvais mettre la main sur un peu de ce machin astral que les types érudits utilisaient pour faire apparaître leurs trucs bizarres, je pourrais concocter un gadget génial qui pourrait faire la même magie pour ces machins de synergie !${prompt}

  10425: Je travaille sur une invention totalement incroyable, et vous allez m'aider à la compléter !${prompt}

    Maintenant, restez tranquille un moment, d'accord ?${prompt}

    Je l'appelle le « portafourneau » !
    Et en récompense d'avoir rendu ce jour possible, je vous en offre un pour vous-même !${prompt}

  10439: |-
    Partout, sauf dans les villes et les villages bondés. Et les donjons.
    Et à l'intérieur des bâtiments ? Et peut-être dans certains autres endroits aussi.
    Cela dit, ce n'est pas un défaut--c'est une fonctionnalité ! La sécurité d'abord, comme on dit.${prompt}
  10440: |-
    Non, non, vous n'avez pas à me le dire--je sais que je suis géniale !
    Bonne journée, et que mon invention ingénieuse vous soit utile !${prompt}

    Vous serez ravi d'apprendre que je travaille déjà sur ma prochaine invention : un machin qui peut prendre ce truc d'un de ces machins, et le convertir en pur machin-truc à utiliser avec les trucs !
    Ça a l'air génial, non ?${prompt}
  10443: |-
    Quoi ? Ne me dites pas que vous avez perdu le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que j'ai fabriqué pour vous.
    Je suis déçue ! Il y a beaucoup de sang, de sueur et de machins dans la fabrication de chacune de ces merveilles !${prompt}
  10444: |-
    Mais bon, j'ai un faible pour les types déconcertés comme vous.
    Voici un tout neuf. Promettez-moi juste que vous allez le garder cette fois, d'accord ?${prompt}

    affluent vers des nations émergentes comme Bastok.
    Vous en faites partie.${wait-animation: 5}
  10476: |-
    Votre histoire commence ici, au milieu de la fumée
    et de l'agitation de la ville industrielle de Bastok.${wait-animation: 5}
  10477: Excusez-moi...${prompt}
  10478: Comment puis-je me rendre au quartier résidentiel ?${prompt}
  10479: '...${prompt}'
  10480: |-
    Euh, bonjour. Je suis nouveau à Bastok.
    Pouvez-vous me dire où se trouve le quartier résidentiel ?${prompt}
  10481: Oh ! Je suis désolé, je n'avais pas réalisé que vous étiez nouveau ici aussi.${prompt}
  10482: |-
    Je suppose que je vais devoir trouver le chemin moi-même.
    Les gens ne sont pas très amicaux par ici, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10483: De toute façon, bonne chance à nous deux !${prompt}
  10484: |-
    Sacré Hume... Où croit-il être, Windurst ?
    Quelle journée décidément.${prompt}
  10485: Vous n'êtes pas d'ici non plus, hein ? Inutile de nier... Je le sens.${prompt}
  10486: Si vous ne voulez pas avoir de problèmes, tournez les talons et rentrez chez vous.${prompt}
  10487: Hé, hé ! Pas besoin d'être aussi impoli.${prompt}
  10488: De plus, s'en prendre à ce pauvre ${choice-player-gender}[gars/fille] n'en vaut pas la peine.${prompt}
  10489: Oh ? Depuis quand vous souciez-vous de ce qui arrive aux étrangers, Gumbah ?${prompt}
  10490: Je dis juste qu'un tel que vous ne devrait pas se mêler de leurs affaires, Ô Grand Guerrier Deidogg.${prompt}
  10491: Hrmph. Peu importe.${prompt}
  10492: Vous vous souvenez, étranger, je ne serai pas aussi accommodant la prochaine fois.${prompt}
  10493: |-
    Désolé pour ça.
    Les gens peuvent être si têtus ici parfois.${prompt}
  10494: Hé, pourquoi cette mine sombre ? Tu n’aimes pas qu’on te parle comme à un nouveau recrue ? Mais c’est bien ta première fois ici, non ?${prompt}
  10495: |-
    Première fois à Bastok ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10496: |-
    Vraiment ?
    Eh bien, on dirait que tu n’as pas encore beaucoup exploré.${prompt}
  10497: |-
    Y a-t-il quelque chose que tu voudrais savoir ? Quelque chose que tu veux faire ?
    Peut-être que je peux t’indiquer la bonne direction.${prompt}
  10498: |-
    Que veux-tu faire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Combattre des monstres !
    Faire du shopping.
    Trouver du travail.${prompt}
  10499: Alors tu ne devrais pas avoir à entrer dans la ville pour commencer.${prompt}
  10500: Retourne par où tu es venu et passe par la Porte Sud. Cela te mènera à l'extérieur.${prompt}
  10501: Oh, et assure-toi toujours de « vérifier » les monstres avant de les affronter. Tu ne veux pas te battre contre des choses que tu ne peux pas vaincre.${prompt}
  10502: Il y a quelques petites boutiques à travers cet arc là-bas, mais...${prompt}
  10503: Si tu veux des choses de meilleure qualité, tu devrais aller aux Marchés.${prompt}
  10504: |-
    Bon choix. Tu devrais commencer par un objectif à court terme pour te mettre sur la bonne voie.
    Quel type de travail recherches-tu ?${prompt}
  10505: |-
    Que veux-tu faire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Servir Bastok.
    Aider les gens.
    Devenir riche rapidement.${prompt}
  10506: |-
    Tu devrais aller parler à un garde de porte.
    Essaie l’une des portes de la ville, comme celle par laquelle tu es venu.${prompt}
  10507: |-
    C’est l’esprit !
    Pourrais-tu me rendre un service et aider un ami à moi ?${prompt}
  10508: C’est la première maison au bout de la route à travers ce grand arc.${prompt}
  10509: Eh bien, si je savais quelque chose à ce sujet, je ne serais pas ici, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10510: De toute façon, peut-être qu’Echo Hawk peut t’aider. Il a des oreilles partout.${prompt}
  10511: Prends à droite et passe directement par cette entrée. Il traîne généralement par là.${prompt}
  10512: |-
    Oh, et prends ceci. C’est ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Arva devrait te donner de l’argent pour cela. Elle se trouve autour de l’arrière du magasin d’articles de première nécessité.${prompt}
  10513: |-
    Ne t’inquiète pas, ce n’est pas à moi. Je l’ai juste trouvé.
    Arva devrait être quelque part dans le coin...${prompt}
  10514: |-
    Voici.
    Tu peux vérifier ta carte à nouveau en sélectionnant “Carte” dans le menu principal à droite.${prompt}
  10515: Oh, je suis sûr que tu sais déjà cela, mais si tu veux donner des objets aux gens en ville, utilise “Échanger” dans le menu principal.${prompt}
  10516: Je crois que c'est tout. Je dois y aller maintenant, mais je suis sûr que nous nous reverrons !${prompt}
  10517: |-
    Je n'ai rien pour toi aujourd'hui.
    Parfois, même moi, je manque d'informations.${prompt}
  10518: |-
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
    Je ne t'ai pas vu ici avant.${prompt}
  10519: Pour un nouveau venu, tu commences bien... Tu es venu me parler.${prompt}
  10520: |-
    Je suis Echo Hawk.
    Je fais commerce d'informations.${prompt}
  10521: Ne te donne pas la peine de demander aux Galka têtus autour d'ici--ils sont trop occupés à contempler leur nombril. Mais pas moi. J'ai des infos sur des choses que la plupart des gens n'ont même jamais entendues.${prompt}
  10522: Ne t'inquiète pas pour l'argent. C'est ma politique de ne pas prendre de gil des novices comme toi.${prompt}
  10523: Mes sources me paient même dans certains cas, tu sais.${prompt}
  10524: |-
    De toute façon, j'ai entendu dire que cet ancien Hume, Wahid, recherche une gemme rare.
    Tu peux le trouver à la maison de vente aux enchères de l'autre côté de ce quartier.${prompt}
  10525: |-
    Apparemment, cela devrait faire partie d'une légende, mais je ne m'occupe pas de ce genre de balivernes.
    Va parler au barde à la taverne. Les contes de fées sont sa spécialité.${prompt}
  10526: |-
    Tu peux probablement le trouver dans le Quartier du Port.
    Ce n'est pas le genre à traîner dans ce quartier louche.${prompt}
  10527: |-
    Bonne chasse alors.
    Reviens quand tu auras besoin de plus d'infos.${prompt}
  10528: |-
    Tu es à la Porte Sud, dans le quartier des Mines de Bastok.
    La Porte Ouest se trouve dans les Marchés, tandis que la Porte Nord est au port.${prompt}
  10529: Depuis l'arrivée du nouveau président, tous les travaux publics sont en retard.${prompt}
  10530: Il ne devrait pas se mêler de ce qui ne le concerne pas et laisser le Chef Cid faire son travail. Ne réalise-t-il pas qu'il est juste une figure de proue de toute façon ?${prompt}
  10531: |-
    Quoi ? La chasse aux timbres ?
    Tu es venu jusqu'ici pour ça, hein ?
    Voilà.${prompt}
  10532: Tu as reçu un timbre !${prompt}
  10533: |-
    Il y a deux donjons à l'extérieur de la ville de Bastok :
    Les Mines de Palborough au Nord de Gustaberg, et le Wadi Dangruf au Sud de Gustaberg.${prompt}
  10534: |-
    Ce quartier est assez rude.
    Fais attention.${prompt}
  10535: |-
    Hmm ? Tu es le nouveau mineur ?
    Non, tu as l'air d'un aventurier. Tu es là pour réduire des monstres en bouillie, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10536: |-
    Ne cause pas de problèmes, d'accord ?
    Nous avons assez à faire avec ces Galka. La seule chose que leur longue vie leur a donnée est une tête dure. Ouf.${prompt}
  10537: |-
    Les fondations de Bastok ont été construites avec le minerai extrait de cette mine.
    Il a fallu beaucoup de sueur et de labeur aux Galka pour creuser cette mine. Nous avons fait de Bastok ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  10538: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 7[2]} ? Oui, j'en avais autrefois, il y a longtemps.
    Je n'en ai plus maintenant.${prompt}
  10539: Tu devrais pouvoir en trouver près de la côte des Dunes de Valkurm... mais seulement pendant les tempêtes de poussière.${prompt}
  10540: Ces Humes sont pleins de bavardages sur comment ils ont creusé les mines de mythril avec leur grande technologie, mais cela ne leur a pas beaucoup servi quand les Quadav sont arrivés, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10541: |-
    “Bienvenue aux Mines de Palborough--faites par les Humes, pleines de Quadav.”
    Une bonne phrase accrocheuse pour leurs mines de mythril, tu ne trouves pas ?${prompt}
  10542: |-
    Bastok a bien changé au fil des années.
    À peu près les seules choses qui ne changent pas sont nous, les Galka, travaillant dans les mines.${prompt}
  10543: Il y a une auberge et la Guilde des Alchimistes par ici, mais à part cela, tu ne trouveras que les maisons des pauvres de Bastok. Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait quoi que ce soit d'intéressant là-dedans.${prompt}
  10544: Quel est le problème ? Es-tu perdu ?${prompt}
  10545: |-
    Demander son chemin ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Demander.
    Ne pas demander.${prompt}
  10546: Où veux-tu aller ?${prompt}
  10547: |-
    Quelle zone aimerais-tu demander ?
    ${selection-lines}
    La Porte Sud et la zone résidentielle.
    Les Marchés et les Mines.
    La ville minière et la Guilde des Alchimistes.
    Euh, oublie.${prompt}
  10548: |-
    Hmm. Eh bien, ne t'aventure pas dans des endroits que tu ne connais pas.
    Ça pourrait être dangereux.${prompt}
  10549: Vois-tu ce grand bâtiment au sud d'ici, sur la gauche ?${prompt}
  10550: |-
    C'est la maison de vente aux enchères.
    Tu peux acheter des objets d'autres personnes ou vendre des objets toi-même là-bas.${prompt}
  10551: |-
    Tu peux aussi y envoyer des objets à tes amis.
    Il suffit de parler au livreur Galka en poste.${prompt}
  10552: Si tu continues vers le sud, tu trouveras la Porte Sud.${prompt}
  10553: |-
    Passe à travers pour aller au Sud de Gustaberg.
    Si tu es un Bastokien, tu peux également recevoir des missions de la part du garde à la maison de garde.${prompt}
  10554: Si tu vas à gauche depuis la Porte Sud vers l'est, tu trouveras un autre bâtiment.${prompt}
  10555: |-
    C'est là que tu trouveras les Écuries de Chocobos.
    Tu peux y louer des chocobos pour t'aider lors de tes longs trajets.${prompt}
  10556: |-
    Si tu continues plus à l'est, tu arriveras à l'entrée de la zone résidentielle.
    Entre si tu veux déposer des objets dans ta chambre.${prompt}
  10557: Cependant, si tu n'es pas de Bastok, tu devras d'abord obtenir une Chambre à Louer.${prompt}
  10558: Passe à travers l'arc ouest d'ici.${prompt}
  10559: |-
    Tu verras une route descendant sur ta droite.
    Descends cette route pour aller dans le quartier des Marchés.${prompt}
  10560: Si tu continues tout droit vers l'ouest, tu pourras voir l'entrée des mines.${prompt}
  10561: |-
    À l'intérieur des mines, tu trouveras bien sûr des mineurs--mais aussi des monstres.
    Tu devrais faire attention.${prompt}
  10562: Au nord de cette bifurcation, il y a deux arcs, un grand et un petit.${prompt}
  10563: Le grand arc mène au niveau inférieur de la ville minière, tandis que le petit mène à son niveau supérieur.${prompt}
  10564: Si tu passes par le petit arc vers le niveau supérieur, tu trouveras une auberge sur ta gauche.${prompt}
  10565: En face de l'auberge se trouve l'armurerie.${prompt}
  10566: Si tu continues plus loin sur la route, tu trouveras un magasin de biens et la sortie arrière de la ville minière.${prompt}
  10567: Passe par la sortie et tu te retrouveras derrière la maison de vente aux enchères.${prompt}
  10568: Tu trouveras aussi des escaliers sur le côté, à mi-chemin de la rue de la ville minière. Ceux-ci relient les niveaux supérieur et inférieur.${prompt}
  10569: À l'extrémité du niveau inférieur, à l'est, c'est là que tu trouveras la Guilde des Alchimistes.${prompt}
  10570: |-
    C'est à peu près tout.
    Je peux te l'expliquer à nouveau, mais il vaudrait peut-être mieux que tu te rendes toi-même à ces endroits et que tu parles aux gens là-bas.${prompt}
  10571: |-
    Que veux-tu ?
    Ce n'est pas un endroit pour des gens comme toi.
    Pars.${prompt}
  10572: |-
    Quoi ?
    Gumbah t'a envoyé, dis-tu ?${prompt}
  10573: Il aurait demandé à un nouveau-né comme toi... Ses yeux lui font-ils défaut, à un âge aussi jeune ?${prompt}
  10574: |-
    Eh bien, je suppose que tu devras faire l'affaire.
    Il a mis sa confiance en toi, donc je dois faire de même.${prompt}
  10575: 'Je suis actuellement employé par le Tenshodo, et ma tâche est de collecter cinq ${item-plural: 7[2]} pour eux.${prompt}'
  10576: |-
    Hélas, j'ai été blessé lorsque j'ai obtenu le quatrième.
    Il me faudra un certain temps avant de pouvoir sortir chercher le cinquième.${prompt}
  10577: Les Tenshodo ont pris les quatre premiers, mais ils refusent de me remettre ma récompense tant que le dernier n'est pas en leur possession.${prompt}
  10578: Je suis sûr qu'ils ne m'auraient pas dit cela si je n'avais pas été blessé.${prompt}
  10579: 'Si tu le veux bien, pourrais-tu remettre le dernier ${item-singular: 7[2]} à Talib du Tenshodo, en mon nom ?${prompt}'
  10580: Il devrait alors te remettre un certain objet en récompense. Je te serais très reconnaissant si tu pouvais me l'apporter.${prompt}
  10581: |-
    Acceptes-tu cette tâche ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10582: C'est...malheureux.${prompt}
  10583: |-
    Merci.
    Oh, avant que tu ne partes, je devrais te dire qu'une Hume entreprend également la même tâche.${prompt}
  10584: |-
    Ce n'est pas une aventurière, et à peine plus qu'une enfant.
    Crois-moi, je ne lui ai pas demandé de faire cela pour moi, et pourtant elle est partie faire le travail.${prompt}
  10585: |-
    Son nom ?
    Je crois qu'elle s'appelle « Cornelia ».${prompt}
  10586: |-
    Pourrais-tu garder un œil sur elle et la protéger, surtout au Tenshodo ?
    Je ne pourrais pas supporter s'il lui arrivait quelque chose.${prompt}
  10587: |-
    Hmm ? Oui, je suis Parraggoh.
    Ah, Cornelia t'a parlé de ma situation.${prompt}
  10588: |-
    Eh bien.
    Elle t'a fait confiance, alors je vais en faire autant.${prompt}
  10589: |-
    Merci.
    Cela me peine de devoir compter sur la gentillesse des gens comme ça, mais tu as ma gratitude.${prompt}
  10590: Cela me peine de devoir compter sur la gentillesse des gens comme ça, mais tu as ma gratitude.${prompt}
  10591: Je dois aussi remercier Cornelia pour sa gentillesse...${prompt}
  10592: |-
    Ah !
    Tu m'as apporté ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} !${prompt}
  10593: |-
    Hmm ?
    Oui, je suis Parraggoh.${prompt}
  10594: 'Quoi ? Cornelia t'a demandé... et tu m'as apporté ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  10595: |-
    Merci !
    J'en avais vraiment besoin !${prompt}
  10596: Ce n'est peut-être pas grand-chose comme récompense, mais je veux que tu prennes ceci.${prompt}
  10597: Si tu vois Cornelia, transmets-lui ma gratitude.${prompt}
  10598: |-
    Non, attends--
    Dis-lui plutôt qu'elle ne devrait pas trop se montrer parmi nous, les Galka.${prompt}
  10599: Pour son propre bien.${prompt}
  10600: |-
    Ah ! C'est bon de te revoir.
    Comment vas-tu ?${prompt}
  10601: |-
    Ce n'est pas un endroit où tu devrais traîner.
    Va-t'en de ma vue, étranger.${prompt}
  10602: |-
    As-tu vu Gumbah ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10603: D'accord. Si tu le vois à nouveau, dis-lui de ne pas fuir la prochaine fois !${prompt}
  10604: Quoi ? Il s'est encore enfui ?${prompt}
  10605: |-
    Il ne tient jamais sa position !
    Mais je m'en occuperai la prochaine fois !${prompt}
  10606: Hé, toi ! As-tu vu un petit Galka appelé « Gumbah » ?${prompt}
  10607: Je suis là. Que veux-tu ?${prompt}
  10608: Ah ! Enfin, nous nous rencontrons à nouveau ! Prépare-toi à affronter ton destin !${prompt}
  10609: |-
    Oh, pas encore. Je t'ai déjà battu la dernière fois ?
    Tu as toujours été un enfant agaçant...${prompt}
  10610: |-
    Hé, tu n'es pas beaucoup plus âgé que moi !
    Ne me parle pas comme si tu étais un vieux !${prompt}
  10611: Et tu as triché la dernière fois ! Tu as apporté une des vieilles épées de Werei !${prompt}
  10612: |-
    Tu n'as pas dit que je ne pouvais pas le faire.
    De plus, tu as triché en premier. Je t'ai vu emprunter l'épée de Deidogg.${prompt}
  10613: |-
    Urk... Eh bien, euh... oublions les épées ! Cette fois, ce sont des casques !
    Celui qui apporte le meilleur casque gagne !
    Et ne prends aucun casque de Werei, Gumbah !${prompt}
  10614: |-
    Oh, s'il te plaît...
    Très bien, je me rends. Tu gagnes. Puis-je partir maintenant ?${prompt}
  10615: Non, non, non ! Tu ne vas pas encore t'enfuir !${prompt}
  10616: |-
    En tout cas, je pense apporter ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Hé, tu es un aventurier, non ? Tu en as un, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10617: |-
    Puis-je l'emprunter juste quelques secondes ?
    Je te le rendrai, je promets ! Je te donnerai même une récompense !${prompt}
  10618: |-
    Ooh ! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ! Merci !
    Maintenant je vais montrer à ce Gumbah...${prompt}
  10619: Tu empruntes encore...${prompt}
  10620: |-
    Te voilà ! Ha-ha ! Regarde, j'ai ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    La victoire est à moi !${prompt}
  10621: Uh-huh, bien pour toi. Mon casque devrait arriver bientôt.${prompt}
  10622: 'Te voilà ! Tiens, j'ai apporté le ${item-singular: 6[2]} que tu as demandé !${prompt}'
  10623: |-
    Qu'en penses-tu ?
    Je gagne ?${prompt}
  10624: |-
    Hé ! Ce n'est pas juste !
    Tu as trompé quelqu'un pour qu'elle t'apporte ce casque !${prompt}
  10625: |-
    Hein ? Trompé ? Que se passe-t-il ?
    Où est l'aventurier Galka qui avait besoin d'un casque ?${prompt}
  10626: |-
    Gumbah ! Mentais-tu à propos de moi ?
    Explique-toi !${prompt}
  10627: Eh bien, euh... Je dois y aller !${prompt}
  10628: |-
    Hé ! Si tu cours, je gagne !
    Ha ! Que dis-tu de cela ?${prompt}
  10629: Ça me va ! À bientôt !${prompt}
  10630: Gumbah ! Reviens ici sur-le-champ !${prompt}
  10631: |-
    Pourquoi ai-je l'impression d'avoir perdu ?
    Quoi qu'il en soit, merci. Voici la récompense que je t'avais promise.${prompt}
  10632: Je suis ici à Bastok pour enquêter sur quelques choses concernant les Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
  10633: |-
    Tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ?
    Pourrais-tu me rendre un service ?${prompt}
  10634: Il y a un monument au sommet de Zegham Hill dans North Gustaberg, érigé en l'honneur des pionniers qui ont creusé les Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
  10635: |-
    Mon arrière-grand-père était l'un d'eux.
    Je voulais aller visiter sa tombe là-bas, mais je n'ai pas pu passer à cause des monstres.${prompt}
  10636: 'Si ce n'est pas trop de problème, j'aimerais que tu places ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} au monument pour moi.${prompt}'
  10637: |-
    Visiter le monument à la place d'Elki ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10638: |-
    Merci.
    Il y a dix noms gravés sur le monument.
    Cherche un “Omran”. C'était mon arrière-grand-père.${prompt}
  10639: |-
    Bien sûr... Je suis désolé.
    Demander à un parfait étranger de risquer sa vie pour moi... J'ai été présomptueux.${prompt}
  10640: |-
    Merci pour ta gentillesse.
    C'est bon d'entendre que le nom d'Omran est toujours là, après toutes ces années.${prompt}
  10641: |-
    Il y avait un onzième nom ?
    “Vig****t O**” ?
    Non, je suis désolé, je ne sais pas qui c'est.
    Attends, à moins que...${prompt}
  10642: |-
    Non, laisse tomber. Merci encore.
    Tiens, c'est pour ta peine.${prompt}
  10643: |-
    Ah, c'est toi. Merci pour l'autre jour.
    Comme tu peux le deviner, visiter la tombe de mon arrière-grand-père n'était pas la seule chose que je suis venu faire ici.${prompt}
  10644: Après avoir examiné le journal de mon arrière-grand-père, je crois qu'il y avait onze pionniers qui ont creusé les Mines de Palborough, et non dix.${prompt}
  10645: Mon arrière-grand-père semblait vraiment regretter que le nom du dernier pionnier n'ait jamais été enregistré avec les leurs.${prompt}
  10646: Je crois que le nom que tu as trouvé, ce “Vig****t O**”, est celui de ce dernier pionnier...${prompt}
  10647: |-
    Mais je ne trouve pas de nom qui corresponde à ces lettres.
    Cela fait plus de cent cinquante ans, donc je ne pense pas qu'il soit encore en vie, mais...${prompt}
  10648: Si tu peux trouver des informations sur cette personne, je te serais vraiment reconnaissant.${prompt}
  10649: |-
    Aider à enquêter ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Demander plus d'informations.
    Aider.
    Ne pas aider.${prompt}
  10650: Les Mines de Palborough furent les premières à être creusées en utilisant des “explosifs”, une invention des Humes.${prompt}
  10651: Avant cela, Bastok devait compter sur la force des Galka pour creuser ses mines. Lorsque les dix pionniers Humes en creusèrent une en utilisant uniquement leur intelligence et leur technologie, cela marqua un tournant majeur dans l'histoire de Bastok.${prompt}
  10652: Tout autre indice qui pourrait éclairer le passé des Mines de Palborough se trouve probablement dans les mines elles-mêmes.${prompt}
  10653: |-
    Merci.
    Si tu découvres quoi que ce soit, s'il te plaît, dis-le-moi immédiatement.${prompt}
  10654: Je vois... Merci quand même.${prompt}
  10655: |-
    Onze ensembles d'outils ?
    Les noms des pionniers sont écrits dessus...${prompt}
  10656: |-
    Le nom du onzième pionnier était... “Vigilant Owl” ?
    Cela ressemble à un nom de Galka.${prompt}
  10657: Et on dit que les Mines de Palborough ont été creusées uniquement par des Humes...${prompt}
  10658: |-
    Attends, il y a une autre inscription sur cet outil...
    “Babenn” ? Est-ce un autre nom ?${prompt}
  10659: |-
    Je me demande ce que cela signifie...
    Je vais essayer d'en savoir plus de mon côté, mais fais-moi savoir si tu trouves d'autres informations.${prompt}
  10660: |-
    Un onzième pionnier des Mines de Palborough ?
    Alors c'est comme je le pensais !${prompt}
  10661: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]} que tu m'as apporté -- plus je les lis, plus je suis convaincu que quelqu'un a altéré ces documents !${prompt}'
  10662: Cela doit être les Humes ! Seuls eux pourraient aller aussi loin que d'effacer notre histoire pour protéger leur fierté démesurée !${prompt}
  10663: |-
    Je... Je suis désolé.
    Je ne devrais pas laisser mes émotions prendre le dessus.${prompt}
  10664: Les pionniers ? Eh bien, oui, j'ai travaillé dans les mines jusqu'à il y a quinze ans, mais tu parles de choses qui se sont passées il y a plus de cent cinquante ans !${prompt}
  10665: |-
    Je suis peut-être vieux, mais je ne suis pas si vieux.
    Va parler à Babenn. Maintenant que Werei est parti, il est le seul Galka qui était encore là à l'époque.${prompt}
  10666: |-
    Les Pionniers de Palborough ?
    Oui, j'étais en vie à l'époque, mais je me souviens que j'étais en aventure ces jours-là.
    Je crains de ne pas pouvoir t'aider avec ce que tu cherches.${prompt}
  10667: |-
    Hmm ?
    Que veux-tu d'un vieux Galka comme moi ?${prompt}
  10668: |-
    Vigilant... Owl ?
    Ce nom ne me dit rien.${prompt}
  10669: |-
    Je n'ai rien à te dire.
    Pars et emporte cette vieille boîte à outils avec toi.${prompt}
  10670: Ah, maintenant je comprends...${prompt}
  10671: C'est peut-être pour ça que tu n'aimes pas parler du passé, alors, Babenn ?${prompt}
  10672: |-
    Mais cela fait plus de cent cinquante ans.
    Ne penses-tu pas qu'il est temps que tu racontes ton histoire ?${prompt}
  10673: Gumbah... Que fais-tu ici ?${prompt}
  10674: |-
    Tu as dû comprendre maintenant, n'est-ce pas ?
    Les Galka à Bastok ont deux noms.${prompt}
  10675: L'un est notre nom donné. L'autre... un nom que les Humes nous donnent s'ils ne peuvent pas prononcer le premier.${prompt}
  10676: |-
    “Vigilant Owl”... c'est ainsi qu'ils t'appelaient, n'est-ce pas, Babenn ?
    Tu me l'as déjà dit... et je ne l'ai pas oublié.${prompt}
  10677: |-
    Enfant perturbateur...
    C'était il y a plus d'un siècle.
    Ce nom appartient au passé.${prompt}
  10678: |-
    Attends...
    Qui est là ? Montre-toi !${prompt}
  10679: Mon arrière-grand-père n'a pas oublié, Sir Vigilant Owl... Non, Sir Babenn.${prompt}
  10680: |-
    Omran... !?
    Non, tu ne peux pas être lui.
    Les Humes ne vivent pas plus de cent ans.${prompt}
  10681: |-
    Omran était mon arrière-grand-père.
    Il me racontait les mines quand j'étais jeune... mais chaque fois qu'il le faisait, c'était avec tristesse et regret.${prompt}
  10682: |-
     Il disait souvent :
    “Si tu parviens à réaliser quelque chose de valable dans la vie, c'est parce que tu as eu la chance de rencontrer les meilleures personnes que l'on puisse rencontrer.”${prompt}
  10683: Omran a dit ça ?${prompt}
  10684: |-
    Écoute et souviens-toi, héritier d'Omran.
    À l'époque, les Humes avaient besoin de fierté. Fierté d'avoir creusé une mine sans l'aide de personne d'autre.${prompt}
  10685: Mon nom n'avait pas sa place sur leur monument, et cela, je l'ai accepté.${prompt}
  10686: |-
    Certains ont besoin de voir leurs réalisations gravées dans la pierre, même si la pierre peut s'altérer et s'effacer.
    C'était un petit prix à payer pour leur gloire.${prompt}
  10687: |-
    Non !
    Mon arrière-grand-père ne cherchait pas la gloire !${prompt}
  10688: Il me disait que les jours passés à creuser ces mines étaient les meilleurs de sa vie !${prompt}
  10689: |-
    Assez.
    Tu sais aussi bien que moi que les Galka et les Humes ne vivent pas au même rythme.${prompt}
  10690: '...${prompt}'
  10691: |-
    Mais je peux te dire une chose.
    Il y a cent cinquante ans, pendant ces quelques jours où nous cherchions du mythril dans les tunnels froids et sombres... nous voyions le monde avec les mêmes yeux.${prompt}
  10692: |-
    Et pour moi, cela suffit.
    Peu importe ce que les gens disent, et même si les autres sont partis depuis longtemps, mes souvenirs sont toujours avec moi.${prompt}
  10693: Héritier d'Omran, ne cherche pas la vérité de notre lien dans les jours passés, mais dans les liens que tu partages avec les autres en ce moment, dans ce monde.${prompt}
  10694: |-
    ...Je comprends.
    Adieu, monsieur.${prompt}
  10695: |-
    C'était plutôt compliqué...
    J'espère vraiment qu'il a compris.${prompt}
  10696: |-
    C'est toi qui as compliqué les choses.
    Tu l'as amené ici, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10697: |-
    Et où as-tu entendu parler de mon passé ?
    Je ne me souviens pas t'en avoir parlé.${prompt}
  10698: |-
    Oh, vraiment ? C'est étrange...
    Euh... je pense que Werei me l'a dit, oui.${prompt}
  10699: |-
    Quoi qu'il en soit, je dois y aller !
    Au revoir !${prompt}
  10700: |-
    Il semble que je te dois des excuses.
    C'est pour avoir ramené ma vieille boîte à outils.
    Prends-la.${prompt}
  10701: |-
    Hmm ?
    Que veux-tu d'un vieux Galka comme moi ?${prompt}
  10702: |-
    Rien de valeur n'a été mis en vente aux enchères récemment.
    L'influence des Quadavs sur les fouilles minières de Bastok pourrait être plus sévère que je ne le pensais.${prompt}
  10703: |-
    Wahid, à votre service.
    Je suis un collectionneur de pierres précieuses.${prompt}
  10704: |-
    Sachez que je ne suis pas intéressé par les pierres ayant uniquement une valeur monétaire.
    Les gemmes légendaires, dont la valeur ne peut être pesée en or... celles-là, un véritable collectionneur les recherche.${prompt}
  10705: |-
    Actuellement, je recherche une pierre appelée ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    On dit qu'on peut parfois les trouver sur les rivages des rivières dans les montagnes de Gustaberg.${prompt}
  10706: Elles sont assez difficiles à trouver, dit-on, alors cherche bien.${prompt}
  10707: De plus, j'ai entendu des récits de personnes essayant d'en attraper un, pour le voir leur glisser entre les doigts et flotter à nouveau dans la rivière.${prompt}
  10708: Beaucoup d'aventuriers comme vous ont tenté leur chance, pour revenir... eh bien, les mains vides. J'ai entendu dire que ceux de grande valeur avaient eu une difficulté particulière.${prompt}
  10709: |-
    Il y a eu un barde qui a réussi à en ramener un... mais il a dit que ce serait la première et la dernière fois pour lui.
    S'il était incapable ou réticent à revenir, je ne sais pas.${prompt}
  10710: D'après ce que j'ai entendu, il passe maintenant son temps à chanter dans une taverne quelque part...${prompt}
  10711: Quoi qu'il en soit, si vous allez à la rivière et en trouvez un pour moi, je vous récompenserai.${prompt}
  10712: |-
    Oh-ho ! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    Bon travail !${prompt}
  10713: |-
    Oui, oui ! Regardez comme il brille ! Merveilleux, tout simplement merveilleux !
    Si vous en trouvez d'autres, venez me voir et je vous récompenserai généreusement !${prompt}
  10714: |-
    Ma maman est la plus grande aventurière qui soit !
    Chaque fois qu'elle revient, elle me rapporte plein de cadeaux sympas !${prompt}
  10715: |-
    Descendez cette route pour aller au quartier des Marchés.
    C'est aussi la route pour les Ateliers et le Quartier du Port.${prompt}
  10716: Maman dit que c'est dangereux là-bas, et je ne peux pas y aller...${prompt}
  10717: |-
    Mais un jour, j'irai à l'intérieur !
    Tout le monde sait que lorsque les grands disent ce genre de choses, ils essaient juste de garder un endroit amusant pour eux seuls !${prompt}
  10718: |-
    Après qu'un Galka ait vécu plus de deux cents ans, il se réincarne.
    Malheureusement, il ne garde aucun souvenir de sa vie précédente.
    Mais chaque génération, il y a un Galka qui se souvient.${prompt}
  10719: |-
    Il se souvient de tout de sa vie passée, et il devient le Gardien des Récits, le leader de tous les Galka.
    Hélas, nous avons perdu notre Gardien des Récits il y a trente ans.${prompt}
  10720: J'ai vécu plus de deux cents ans, mais je n'ai pas encore vu d'amélioration dans notre relation avec les Humes de Bastok.${prompt}
  10721: |-
    La perte de notre Gardien des Récits n'a fait qu'aggraver les choses...
    Cela a jeté une ombre noire sur le cœur de tous les Galka.${prompt}
  10722: La plupart des Galka ici n'aiment pas beaucoup les Humes.${prompt}
  10723: C'est pourquoi nous ne nous appelons pas par les noms que les Humes nous donnent.${prompt}
  10724: |-
    Werei était le plus vieux Galka ici.
    Il était vraiment fort quand il était jeune, vous savez.${prompt}
  10725: C'est lui qui a appris à se battre à Iron Eater, le seul Galka des Mousquetaires de Mythril.${prompt}
  10726: Cette zone est interdite.${prompt}
  10727: |-
    Vous êtes ici pour la chasse aux tampons, n'est-ce pas ? Tenez.
    Je me demande pourquoi tant d'aventuriers participent à cette chose.
    Mais après tout, je ne voudrais pas non plus que des enfants traînent ici.${prompt}
  10728: Même avec tout le progrès technologique vanté de Bastok, les chocobos, surtout ceux de San d'Oria, sont toujours préférés par les aventuriers comme montures.${prompt}
  10729: Et bien sûr, nos chocobos sont importés directement de San d'Oria !${prompt}  
  10730: |-
    Il y a vingt ans, il y a eu une guerre entre nous et les bêtes.
    Le capitaine Volker des Mousquetaires de Mythril et l'ingénieur en chef Cid sont devenus des héros dans cette guerre...${prompt}
  10731: |-
    Mais c'est l'histoire des Humes.
    Peu savent que nous avons perdu notre meilleur épéiste, le chevalier noir Zeid, lors de ce conflit.
    Il n'a toujours pas été retrouvé, que ce soit vivant ou mort.${prompt}
  10732: Bien sûr, pour les Humes, ce n'est qu'un détail historique, bientôt oublié.${prompt}
  10733: La perte du Gardien des Récits Raogrimm il y a trente ans, et la perte plus récente de Zeid, nous ont durement frappés en ce temps de besoin.${prompt}
  10734: |-
    Nous, les Galka, sommes naturellement unis par la présence de notre Gardien des Récits.
    En son absence, nous sommes comme un équipage naufragé, perdu et dérivant dans le noir...${prompt}
  10735: |-
    Bastok est un endroit effrayant !
    Guerre ouverte avec les Quadavs ! Tout le monde se bat !${prompt}
  10736: |-
    Windurst est tellement différent ! Très paisible !
    Nous tapons parfois sur les Yagudos, oui, mais au moins nous essayons de leur parler d'abord !${prompt}
  10737: |-
    Se tuer les uns les autres n'est pas la solution !
    Mes petits os tremblent !${prompt}
  10738: Les Bastokers sont toujours grincheux parce qu'ils se battent tout le temps !${prompt}
  10739: Honnêtement, les Galka dans ce quartier me font le plus peur, encore plus que les Quadavs...${prompt}
  10740: |-
    Oopsy-doopsy. Ce n'était pas très gentil de ma part !
    S'il vous plaît, ne dites à personne que j'ai dit ça !${prompt}
  10741: |-
    Quoi ? Les Mines de Gusgen ?
    Oh, vous voulez savoir à propos de ${color: 5}glocolite${color: 1}.${prompt}
  10742: |-
    Je dois vous avertir, cela ne vaut pas le risque.
    Mais vous êtes en mission officielle, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10743: Il y a des poches d'eau souterraine dans ces mines. Un monstre spécial vit dans l'une d'elles, mais vous devrez l'attirer.${prompt}
  10744: Déposez un appât à un endroit spécial sur le sol, et il viendra.${prompt}
  10745: |-
    Il aime les ${item-plural: 6[2]}, alors utilisez-en un de ceux-là. Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de le vaincre et vous obtiendrez votre ${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Il y a beaucoup de rivières là-bas, mais un seul endroit où il apparaît. Quoi qu'il en soit, bonne chance !${prompt}
  10746: |-
    Je pensais vous avoir dit que je ne voulais pas d'aide, je--
    Oh, je suis désolé. Je pensais que vous étiez quelqu'un d'autre.
    Elle ne cesse de me déranger...${prompt}
  10747: |-
    Salut, Monsieur Pavvke !
    Comment va votre santé ?${prompt}
  10748: |-
    Je savais que vous reviendriez...
    Je suis peut-être vieux, mais je ne suis pas encore mourant.${prompt}
  10749: |-
    Oups, désolé.
    C'était Parraggoh...${prompt}
  10750: 'De toute façon, je suis allé demander aux aventuriers près des Ateliers s'ils avaient déjà vu les ${item-plural: 7[2]} dont vous m'avez parlé, mais personne n'en savait rien.${prompt}'
  10751: |-
    C'est très gentil de votre part, mais cela fait plus de quinze ans depuis l'accident...
    Je dois accepter le fait que mes amis, et leurs affaires, sont partis pour toujours.${prompt}
  10752: |-
    Non, n'abandonnez pas !
    Je suis sûr que nous trouverons quelque chose !${prompt}
  10753: '...${prompt}'
  10754: |-
    Hé, êtes-vous déjà allé aux Mines de Palborough ?
    Avez-vous vu des ${item-plural: 7[2]} traînant par là ?${prompt}
  10755: |-
    Je travaillais autrefois aux Mines de Palborough avec de nombreux autres Galka.
    Il y a vingt ans, une explosion s'est produite avant que nous ayons dégagé les tunnels, et soudain nous étions entourés de Quadavs.${prompt}
  10756: |-
    Beaucoup de Galka sont morts ce jour-là...
    Je cherche leurs ${item-plural: 7[2]}.
    Les défunts doivent être honorés.${prompt}
  10757: Je suis un peu passionné par l'histoire de Bastok, et Monsieur Pavvke m'a beaucoup appris. Mais quand il m'a parlé des Mines de Palborough... je devais essayer de l'aider.${prompt}
  10758: 'Si vous trouvez des ${item-plural: 7[2]}, pourriez-vous les lui apporter ? Je vous paierai, bien sûr.${prompt}'
  10759: |-
    Non, Cornelia, tu ne devrais pas. Je ne pourrais pas te demander ça.
    Je paierai la récompense moi-même.${prompt}
  10760: |-
    ...D'accord.
    Eh bien, je devrais aller parler à d'autres aventuriers.
    L'un d'eux est censé savoir quelque chose !${prompt}
  10761: |-
    <Soupir>
    Ce n'est pas que je n'apprécie pas, mais elle ne devrait pas s'impliquer dans les affaires des autres comme ça...${prompt}
  10762: |-
    V-vous avez trouvé ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    Dans les Mines de Palborough, oui ?${prompt}
  10763: |-
    Merci !
    Vous ne savez pas ce que cela signifie pour moi.${prompt}
  10764: |-
    Il devrait y en avoir d'autres là où vous avez trouvé celui-ci.
    Si vous les trouvez, veuillez me les apporter.
    Je suis désolé de ne pas pouvoir vous donner plus, mais voici votre récompense.${prompt}
  10765: |-
    Je suis content que vous l'ayez trouvé ! Je savais que vous le feriez !
    Quoi ? Pourquoi suis-je ici ?${prompt}
  10766: Eh bien, Monsieur Pavvke me gronderait probablement si j'essayais de vous donner une récompense. Il dirait quelque chose comme : « elle ne devrait pas se mêler de nos affaires... »${prompt}
  10767: |-
    Je sais, je sais. Il a raison.
    Mais je ne peux pas m'en empêcher. Chaque fois que je décide de faire quelque chose, je ne peux penser à rien d'autre.${prompt}
  10768: You know something? The more I listen to Mister Pavvke's stories, the more I can see the gap in understanding between the Galka and Humes.${prompt}
  10769: |-
    But the Galka shouldn't be blamed for that, you know?
    Humes haven't exactly been nice to them, putting them to work and all...
    Most of the people who died in the accident Mister Pavvke was caught in were Galka, too.${prompt}
  10770: |-
    I wish I could somehow bridge the gap between the Galka and Humes...
    Well then! Enough talk, I have to go. See you around!${prompt}
  10771: |-
    Oh! A prrresent from Mom!
    Thank you for bringing it!${prompt}
  10772: |-
    Wait, don't go yet!
    Here, could you give this to Mom? Please?${prompt}
  10773: |-
    A present for Mom?
    Umm... I think she should be home soon.${prompt}
  10774: Hey kitten, I'm home!${prompt}
  10775: |-
    Mom!
    This stranger's brought a prrresent for you!${prompt}
  10776: |-
    A present? Oh, right!
    You went to the Konschtat Highlands, then?
    What did you find? C'mon, show me!${prompt}
  10777: |-
    Huh? ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]}?
    Doesn't look like anyone famous painted it, either...${prompt}
  10778: |-
    Mom? If you don't want it, can I have it?
    I like it! It's prrretty!${prompt}
  10779: |-
    Of course, darling. Here.
    Well, at least my daughter's happy.
    I'm sorry, but for something like that, I can't pay you more than this...${prompt}
  10780: |-
    Hi!
    You know, we also had a visitor before Werei left...${prompt}
  10781: |-
    I apologize for bothering you again.
    I wished to speak with you about Zeid...${prompt}
  10782: |-
    Hey, Werei?
    The Musketeer's back again.${prompt}
  10783: Captain Volker... We Galka would also like to know of Zeid's whereabouts, but none of us knows where he might be.${prompt}
  10784: |-
    You must understand, I cannot continue to perform my duties with a clear conscience unless I know what became of him.
    As you know, Zeid is the one who should be leading the Mythril Musketeers, not I.${prompt}
  10785: |-
    Is it your uncle you think of when you say this?
    True, many Galka were upset by his appointment as Captain after Raogrimm disappeared, but...${prompt}
  10786: |-
    We do not feel the same way about you.
    As Zeid is different from Raogrimm, you are very different from your uncle.${prompt}
  10787: '...It is not because of my uncle, sir.${prompt}'
  10788: |-
    I am glad to hear that. I now feel safe in telling you that a dark knight was sighted in the Palborough Mines.
    He was very powerful, I am told.${prompt}
  10789: Then it is...?${prompt}
  10790: That is all I know.${prompt}
  10791: So...why are there less dark knights since Zeid disappeared? Any idea?${prompt}
  10792: |-
    Well... Zeid did, in a sense, create his own version of the art, passed down since the glory days of Altepa.
    And it is not something one can master with skill alone.${prompt}
  10793: It is said that only the few who can tame the dark flames that burn within their soul, feeding on their sorrow and hatred...are chosen.${prompt}
  10794: |-
    ...That's one of the last things I remember Werei saying.
    Say, why don't you go find Zeid yourself?
    Maybe he can teach you how to become a dark knight, too.${prompt}
  10795: Though Werei once told me that the road to becoming one is not an easy one to take.${prompt}
  10796: |-
    What to do, what to do?
    Ah, an adventurer! Could you help out a lowly trader?
    I'm working as an intermediary between the Metalworks and the Alchemists' Guild.${prompt}
  10797: 'I''m supposed to get them some materials for this collaborative project they''re working on, and I got everything except for ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10798: |-
    Sounds easy, right?
    I only have to fill ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} with water from the Drachenfall in North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  10799: |-
    The problem is, I can't find a place where I can get close enough to the falls to scoop some water up.
    Would you mind going in my place? Here, I'll give you ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.${prompt}
  10800: |-
    Oh, it's you. Did you lose the ${item-singular: 6[2]}?
    Here, I'll give you another one.
    Don't lose it this time.${prompt}
  10801: |-
    You got it! Thank the heavens!
    You saved my neck!
    Here, take this, you deserve it!${prompt}
  10802: Hume bigwigs don't bother comin' around here, so traders like me can go about their business all unconstrained-like. Heh-heh.${prompt}
  10803: The workers in the mines and those who went out to avenge them...many of my brethren were slain by the Quadav.${prompt}
  10804: I want the Quadav to pay for what they did, so that the souls of my fallen comrades may rest in peace.${prompt}
  10805: |-
    I want you to go to the Quadav stronghold in Beadeaux and kill as many of them as you can.
    Bring me back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} as proof of your deeds, and I will reward you.${prompt}
  10806: Good work. Now the souls of my brethren can finally rest in peace.${prompt}
  10807: The government won't do anything about the monsters in the Zeruhn Mines. It's not “cost-effective.” But those things always get in the way of work, you know?${prompt}
  10808: |-
    If you can go in there and kill a few, my buddies and I will put together a reward for you.
    Oh, and don't forget to bring me three ${item-plural: 7[2]} as proof you did the job.${prompt}
  10809: |-
    Good work!
    We could use more people like you!${prompt}
  10810: |-
    Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you.
    I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Ronfaure, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}
  10811: |-
    Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you.
    I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Fauregandi, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}

    I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Valdeaunia, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}

    Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you.
    I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Li'Telor, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}
  10815: |-
    Hey, you're an adventurer, right?
    Could you take this note to my husband?
    He forgot to take it with him.${prompt}
  10816: |-
    My husband's name is Zelman.
    You'll find him in the Zeruhn Mines. He's a miner.
    All right, then, off you go!${prompt}
  10817: |-
    What? He thinks doing the groceries isn't dignified?
    Ha! That's a laugh!
    And just who does he think's putting food on the table while he's off taking naps in that little hole of his!?${prompt}
  10818: |-
    You bought this, didn't you?
    Hmm... I was going to give this present to my husband, since he needed some cheering up lately, but...${prompt}
  10819: |-
    Since you did his chores for him, it's yours.
    Well, he always wanted to be an adventurer himself, so he should be happy knowing you have it.${prompt}
  10820: |-
    Ah, did you find my husband? Good.
    I keep telling him to check his pockets before he leaves, but he never does.
    Anyway, here, take this. For your trouble.${prompt}
  10821: |-

  10947: |-
    What do you want to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is the auction house?
    How are auctions run?
    Are there any fees?
    Are there any limits?
    How do you check up on merchandise?
    How do you remove an item?
    My “Sales Status” list is full!
    Nothing right now.${prompt}
  10948: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt}
  10949: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt}
  10950: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt}
  10951: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt}
  10952: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt}
  10953: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt}
  10954: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt}
  10955: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt}
  10956: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt}
  10957: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt}
  10958: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt}
  10959: Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt}
  10960: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt}
  10961: To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt}
  10962: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt}
  10963: At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt}
  10964: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt}
  10965: Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt}
  10966: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt}

  11019: Hand my letter to Eperdur in the San d'Oria Cathedral to claim your reward.${prompt}
  11020: |-
    The Goddess's image has been restored!
    Yet...I've received word from the cathedral that my pilgrimage is not yet complete.${prompt}
  11021: The Gates of Paradise are very far, indeed...${prompt}
  11022: |-
    Good day, young whipper-snapper.
    You look as if you've been working hard.${prompt}
  11023: |-
    Good day, young ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lass].
    I can see that you've become quite the adventurer. When you get to be my age, you can tell these things, you know.${prompt}
  11024: My darling son, may his soul rest in peace, was a warrior, and so was my grandson...until he decided to quit and become a doorman.${prompt}
  11025: |-
    My son didn't teach him how to wield a sword so he could go waste his skill on being a doorman.
    That boy just doesn't understand...${prompt}
  11026: He didn't even take his father's sword with him.${prompt}
  11027: |-
    Sure, it may be a little old and may need a few repairs.
    I think that the handle requires some kind of special part...${prompt}
  11028: 'I remember my son saying he had found ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} in a tent when he and some great Galka named Ragarimin, or something like that, went on an expedition to the Orcs'' stronghold.${prompt}'
  11029: If you happen to stop by there on your way somewhere, picking some up would make me ever so grateful.${prompt}
  11030: |-
    Well I'll be! You've brought me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}!
    I'll ask my sweetie in the Blacksmiths' Guild to fix it all up, good as new.${prompt}
  11031: |-
    I'm sorry. I have no way to repay you now.
    Could you please come back tomorrow?${prompt}
  11032: |-
    Thanks to you, my son's sword is as good as it was the day it was forged.
    I'm sorry to bother you any further, but could you take this to my grandson?${prompt}
  11033: To get to where he's stationed, I hear you have to ride this newfangled elevatie contraption.${prompt}
  11034: They say that doormen get decent pay, so you can get your reward from my grandson. I'm sure he won't mind.${prompt}
  11035: His name? Oh, it's Naji.${prompt}
  11036: So, you took the sword to my grandson? Hmm...and the sword was connected to that Sir Ragimorimm character?${prompt}
  11037: Now that you mention it, when Sir Ragamuffimm was a young'un, he was always acting all grown-up. Why do you suppose that is..?${prompt}
  11038: All those Galka praising the likes of him... Except for one. There was one who hated that Sir Ragamamm.${prompt}
  11039: |-
    Yes, I remember my son having a bit of trouble with that fellow.
    I think his name was Deidogolly, or something like that.${prompt}
  11040: |-
    What do you think you're looking at?
    Huh? Deidogolly? What did that old Phara woman say?
    That nonsense has nothing to do with me.${prompt}
  11041: |-
    What? You're still here?
    I don't know anything about any pesky old Hume woman. Raogrimm and Yasin? Yeah, I knew them. Raogrimm and I were the same age, too. ${prompt}
  11042: |-
    Sure, he was the Talekeeper.
    Sure, when he was reborn the same year as I was, he had two hundred years of knowledge.${prompt}
  11043: |-
    Of course I hated him.
    Raogrimm the know-it-all, acting like an elder when he was just a kid... Always adored by everyone...${prompt}
  11044: |-
    And on top of that, becoming a Musketeer to win the favor of the Humes--how low can you get!?
    I even heard rumors that he was having relations with one of their females.${prompt}
  11045: Yeah, yeah. I heard the story about him taking down some mighty Quadav in the Palborough Mines, but I don't believe it.${prompt}
  11046: He was told to bring back a certain item as proof, but you know, he never did.${prompt}
  11047: “The beast did not carry one.” That's what he said, but it's a lie. A lie he told to gain fame. I bet you he never went anywhere near the beast's lair.${prompt}
  11048: You seem strong enough. Why don't you go and see if you can take down that Quadav? They say it appears deep in the Palborough Mines in some room where the Quadav keep their eggs.${prompt}
  11049: 'If you can bring back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, then it will prove that Raogrimm was a fake!${prompt}'
  11050: |-
    What!?
    You managed to get ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!?
    This proves it! Raogrimm was a liar!${prompt}
  11051: “Talekeeper”... Hah! He was nothing but a fake!${prompt}
  11052: Greetings, Deidogg.${prompt}
  11053: |-
    You!
    If it isn't Pagdako...I mean, “Iron Eater.”
    What, the Humes finally let you off your leash?${prompt}
  11054: |-
    I have some business in this area, but that is of no importance.
    I hear that you have been speaking ill of Sir Raogrimm again.${prompt}
  11055: Yeah...yeah, I have. And why not? Raogrimm lied about killing that Quadav just to gain fame.${prompt}
  11056: '...What are you implying?${prompt}'
  11057: Ah, I see. You are still going on about that...${prompt}
  11058: |-
    Sir Raogrimm fought the beastmen for the good of his countrymen.
    He would never steal trophies for his own profit or fame.${prompt}
  11059: The order was for him to take down the Quadav, not to retrieve the item.${prompt}
  11060: And, I have also heard that Sir Raogrimm himself questioned many of his orders, finding them at odds with his moral beliefs.${prompt}
  11061: What does that have to do with anything!?${prompt}
  11062: But there was one time, and one time only, when Sir Raogrimm took an item from a monster.${prompt}
  11063: He needed it to finish a new pair of greaves he had promised to a friend.${prompt}
  11064: Greaves... You don't mean...${prompt}
  11065: |-
    He traveled to Castle Oztroja to obtain a rare ${item-singular: 6[2]} from the leeches there...
    It was with this item that he completed his friend's greaves.${prompt}
  11066: That friend would always talk ill of him, but was the only one who would treat him as an equal.${prompt}
  11067: I can't... Why would he... There is no way he could go all the way to Oztroja...a-and I've never heard of such an item anyway.${prompt}
  11068: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
    Where did you get this!?${prompt}
  11069: So you really do get these from the leeches in Castle Oztroja... He went all the way there to keep his promise...${prompt}
  11070: Yes, I do have greaves made of this material. They were sent to me with an unsigned note that only said, “The greaves I promised.”${prompt}
  11071: |-
    His promise...
    It had to be when...${prompt}
  11072: |-
    Raogrimm!
    What's keeping you?${prompt}
  11073: My apologies. The ceremonial outfits adults give me are too cumbersome--especially these shoes.${prompt}
  11074: |-
    Whatever. It sounds to me like you're just spoiled.
    You're the Talekeeper, right? You should be able to choose your own shoes.${prompt}
  11075: But I can't just ignore their good will.${prompt}
  11076: |-
    Oh, come on! Here, you can have these. They're pretty light.
    Don't worry, I got two pairs the other day.${prompt}
  11077: |-
    Thanks...
    How can I repay you?${prompt}
  11078: |-
    You, the boy who can get anything he wants? I don't need any of that junk.
    When you get strong enough to go out on your own, you can get me something a hundred times better than the shoes I just gave you.${prompt}
  11079: |-
    It must have been that promise...
    Why would he remember something stupid like that?
    Even I didn't remember until now...${prompt}
  11080: 'Anyway, I thank you. Those greaves are old now, but I can repair them with this new ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  11081: My days of battle are over. I would like you to have the greaves. Stop by tomorrow morning to pick them up.${prompt}
  11082: |-
    I've finished the greaves.
    These hold the soul of Raogrimm. Use them as he would have.${prompt}
  11083: I hate saying this to an outsider like you, but...thanks. And that's all I'm going to say.${prompt}
  11084: Hey, remember when Iron Eater showed up here?${prompt}
  11085: He was gathering information about Raogrimm. I hear that they are starting up some operation to collect his lost items...${prompt}
  11086: And so I got this idea...${prompt}
  11087: '...Wait. I can''t be asking outsiders for help. It''s just not like me. Forget what I said!${prompt}'
  11088: |-
    Oh, if it isn't Gwill.
    So what's the occasion?
    Is Dalzakk off adventuring?${prompt}
  11089: Yeah...${prompt}
  11090: |-
    You don't look so good, Gwill.
    You're not being teased by those Hume kids again, are you?${prompt}
  11091: Well, not really teased...${prompt}
  11092: |-
    You wimp!
    Why do you let those creeps push you around like that?
    With your strength, you could teach them a lesson.${prompt}
  11093: If you won't do it, I could always...${prompt}
  11094: |-
    No, no. That's okay...
    It's just that Arawn and Emrys don't understand...${prompt}
  11095: What do you mean, don't understand?${prompt}
  11096: 'Detzo, do you think that ${item-plural: 7[2]} taste good?${prompt}'
  11097: |-
    Huh? What do you mean?
    Well, I've never tried one anyway, so I wouldn't know. But from what I hear, they're supposed to taste pretty good.${prompt}
  11098: I guess I'd have to try one to really find out.${prompt}
  11099: |-
    Yeah...
    Well, the thing is, I have tried one before. Dalzakk brought some back from his adventures once.
    Anyway, it was really good.${prompt}
  11100: When I told this to Arawn and Emrys, they said that there was no way that a cookie with ginger in it could be that delicious.${prompt}
  11101: That's so stupid... They're stupid for saying something like that, and you are just as stupid for getting all upset over it.${prompt}
  11102: |-
    If you can't stick up for yourself over something like that, then you shouldn't talk to those guys anymore.
    Just stay home and read books like you always do, you pitiful excuse for a Galka!${prompt}
  11103: Okay... Bye...${prompt}
  11104: |-
    What a case!
    You know, I think I heard somebody talking about ${item-plural: 7[2]}...${prompt}
  11105: Yeah, I remember now. Deidogg said that he used to eat them with his friend a long time ago.${prompt}
  11106: |-
    Hey. Isn't this ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}?
    Where did you get this?${prompt}
  11107: |-
    ...I see Detzo has a big mouth.
    Yeah, this brings back memories. Raogrimm and I always used to eat these.${prompt}
  11108: That's right. You're the one who wanted to hear about the operation to find some of Raogrimm's lost items.${prompt}
  11109: Many years ago, Raogrimm was sent as an envoy to San d'Oria. As a gesture of friendship, he offered his armor to the Knights of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11110: But apparently it was recently stolen. To San d'Oria, this is an enormous blunder, and the high-ups in Bastok are determined to get it back first.${prompt}
  11111: |-
    Bastok wants to use the armor as a bargaining tool with San d'Oria.
    Unbelievable what outrageous plans those Humes think up...${prompt}
  11112: Hey, why don't you try to find it before the Musketeers do? I'd rather an adventurer like you have that armor than seeing it turned into a political tool for those idiots in the government.${prompt}
  11113: I heard that the ones who stole Raogrimm's armor are a group of Goblin thieves that keep their hideout in the Behemoth's Dominion.${prompt}
  11114: Vana'diel is abuzz with “Adventurer Appreciation” fever, kupo!${prompt}

    Nothing.
    Conquests.
    Conquest results.
    Donating crystals.
    Conquest points.
    The effects of controlling regions.
    Regions controlled by other nations.
    Regions under beastman control.${prompt}
  11149: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt}
  11150: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt}
  11151: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt}
  11152: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt}
  11153: |-
    Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.
    They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  11154: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt}
  11155: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt}
  11156: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  11157: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  11158: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}
  11159: |-
    You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  11160: |-
    We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.
    Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt}
  11161: |-
    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.
    Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt}
  11162: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  11163: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}
  11164: |-
    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  11165: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  11166: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  11167: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  11168: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  11169: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  11170: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  11171: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  11172: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  11173: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  11174: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  11175: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  11176: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  11177: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  11178: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.
    Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt}

    Welcome back.
    How was your battle with the Quadav?${prompt}
  11476: |-
    S-Sir Iron Eater!
    What brings you to this area?${prompt}
  11477: So, what is the situation with the Mines District?${prompt}
  11478: |-
    Sir!
    Nothing out of the ordinary, sir!${prompt}
  11479: |-
    Spare me the textbook answers. That is not what I asked.
    You know what I speak of... The disappearance of Werei.${prompt}
  11480: |-
    Yes sir! I have heard that he was your mentor, and that he has undertaken his journey of rebirth... My condolences, S--
    It is said that he took his life while on his journey of rebirth...${prompt}
  11481: |-
    I did not come here to be told what I already know!
    I am concerned with the fear of the residents along Ore street.${prompt}
  11482: |-
    Yes sir!
    My apologies, sir!
    We will double our efforts to gather any information.${prompt}
  11483: |-
    ...Understood.
    I apologize for my temper.${prompt}
  11484: For someone once known as the immovable rock, it is unusual to see him so angered...${prompt}
  11485: Once a Galka, always a Galka. I guess they have a bond that we Humes will never understand.${prompt}
  11486: 'Sir Iron Eater!${wait-animation: 1}'
  11487: |-
    Have you found anything?
    What is the situation in the Mines District?${prompt}
  11488: |-
    Sir!
    We continued our investigation into the state of the Galka in the Mines District and found that there is definitely a feeling of unrest among most inhabitants of the area. However, we feel that it has not escalated into a problematic situation.${prompt}
  11489: Understood...${prompt}
  11490: I can't believe it. Mister Iron Eater, how can you trust what that Hume is saying?${prompt}
  11491: |-
    Don't you see? You're our only hope!
    We have no Talekeeper, no dark knight, no Werei to help us work things out... Only you!${prompt}
  11492: And what about Gumbah? He tries to act as if nothing happened, but I can tell he's really feeling down.${prompt}
  11493: |-
    I see...
    You and Gumbah may not know this, but Gumbah and Werei were good friends in their former lives.${prompt}
  11494: Gumbah set out on his journey of rebirth before Werei did, but even with the loss of his memories, something drew him back to this town.${prompt}
  11495: |-
    And so began their strange new relationship.
    So of course these new developments with Werei cannot be easy for Gumbah.${prompt}
  11496: I didn't know...${prompt}
  11497: |-
    A mere Musketeer like myself is limited in the things he can do.
    However, I give you my word I will do anything I can to make things right.${prompt}
  11498: Werei...set out on his journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  11499: I'm not upset. I knew it had to happen sooner or later.${prompt}
  11500: He wasn't feeling that good, but he would always hide it whenever someone would visit.${prompt}
  11501: |-
    I guess he was just worried about the people he would leave behind.
    He was always like that.${prompt}
  11502: Come! Take a look at all the wonderful goods from Li'Telor.${prompt}
  11503: May I interest you in some specialty goods from Vollbow?${prompt}
  11504: I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Vollbow, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.${prompt}
  11505: So you're the adventurer the guards sent. Let me tell you what I saw...${prompt}
  11506: What's going on? Why is everyone here?${prompt}
  11507: Why? Ask our new Talekeeper...${prompt}
  11508: Our new what!?${prompt}
  11509: We Galka have been waiting for this boy ever since Raogrimm left us! He is our new Talekeeper!${prompt}
  11510: I came across him in the Korroloka Tunnel. That is where I heard him recite two hundred years of our memories!${prompt}
  11511: I can understand everyone being surprised. I too was taken aback when my destiny was made clear to me.${prompt}
  11512: However, now I realize that I have been chosen to tell the tale of the Galka people. I am the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  11513: I set out on my journey of rebirth to the far western edge of the Altepa Desert.${prompt}
  11514: And why did you go there? Only adventurers are allowed clearance into those remote areas.${prompt}
  11515: In my previous life, I was an adventurer.${prompt}
  11516: The Talekeeper journeyed to our Galkan homeland for rebirth. At Revelation Rock he heard a voice from the heavens!${prompt}
  11517: '“Lead the stray sheep from the land of oppression.” That is what I was told. Then the glowing ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} in my hand unlocked the two hundred years of Galkan memories in my head.${prompt}'
  11518: So...you really are the Talekeeper?${prompt}
  11519: Do you question the voice from the heavens?${prompt}
  11520: How are we to know that...${prompt}
  11521: The Talekeeper speaks only truths.${prompt}
  11522: He does kind of remind me of Sir Raogrimm...${prompt}
  11523: Yeah, now that you mention it...${prompt}
  11524: There is no longer any need to search for Sir Raogrimm, Zeid, or Werei. Our Talekeeper has finally returned!${prompt}
  11525: Now, is there a place where the Talekeeper may rest? He is exhausted from his journey.${prompt}
  11526: It is normally off-limits, but I feel we can make an exception and open up the restricted area on Ore Street. Using an inn would only cause commotion among the city residents.${prompt}
  11527: Very well. Lead us to this restricted area.${prompt}
  11528: And that is what I saw. To tell you the truth, I'm confused. I should be happy to see the return of the Talekeeper, but something tells me there's more to this story...${prompt}
  11529: And now there is talk of sending a party to investigate the Altepa Desert, but you should talk to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines about that.${prompt}
  11530: 'What is this? You were told by Sir Iron Eater to bring this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} back from the Altepa Desert?${prompt}'
  11531: Wait here.${prompt}
  11532: What is the meaning of this, Tall Mountain?${prompt}
  11533: 'Oh, just a personal request. I''d like to see the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} that our Talekeeper found when he was on his journey of rebirth.${prompt}'
  11534: The moonpebble is a thing of Altepan legend. It's not every day that one gets to lay their eyes on a Galkan treasure.${prompt}
  11535: '...${prompt}'
  11536: A-hah-hah. Is that all? Well, normally we wouldn't show it to just anyone, but because you have assisted us so much, I guess we can make an exception.${prompt}
  11537: I see... Then it was all just...${prompt}
  11538: What do you see? It was all just what?${prompt}
  11539: Just a hoax. That is what you meant to say, is it not, Tall Mountain?${prompt}
  11540: Wh-who are you!?${prompt}
  11541: I guess I have much more work to do to get the keeper of two hundred years of memories to remember my name.${prompt}
  11542: What business does a Mythril Musketeer have here? And how dare you call the Talekeeper a fake!${prompt}
  11543: 'This adventurer has succeeded in bringing back a real ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. And by the looks of it, even a guard could tell that yours was not the true one.${prompt}'
  11544: Not the true one? How do you know that the adventurer's is not a fake? Eh!?${prompt}
  11545: How could a Hume-tamed dog like you even tell the difference between a simple rock and an authentic Galkan treasure!?${prompt}
  11546: Are you finished?${prompt}
  11547: Hello there, Talekeeper!${prompt}
  11548: Gumbah?${prompt}
  11549: Wh-who are you?${prompt}
  11550: I'm Gumbah. I just came by to meet the new Talekeeper.${prompt}
  11551: Wow. Two hundred years of Galkan memories to carry around. Gee, that must be pretty tough.${prompt}
  11552: Um...yeah...${prompt}
  11553: I heard from my friend Werei that Talekeepers, well, don't...${prompt}
  11554: '...really get to see many birthdays, if you know what I mean.${prompt}'
  11555: '!!!${prompt}'
  11556: I don't know if Werei meant that the responsibilities of the title were the reason, or if it was just destiny...${prompt}
  11557: Now that I think about it, the former Talekeeper, Raogrimm, also disappeared on a mission to the Northlands. ${prompt}
  11558: There's no way you would catch me being a Talekeeper. I don't think I could handle it!${prompt}
  11559: What is he talking about, Mister Gabbot? You never told me anything about any dangerous missions. You just said if I stuck with you, I could get some delicious grilled mutton!${prompt}
  11560: Shut your mouth, you imbecile! They're trying to trick you!${prompt}
  11561: I'm out of here!${prompt}
  11562: Hey! Wait!${prompt}
  11563: I would advise a quick departure from this city. And if I, or any of the guards, ever catch you back here again...${prompt}
  11564: |-
    You won't have to worry about that.
    I just didn't think you would all fall for my story so easily.${prompt}
  11565: I don't think I made myself clear. Would you like my axe to clear things up for you?${prompt}
  11566: I-I get the picture!${prompt}
  11567: I don't know. I thought he had potential...${prompt}
  11568: It is unusual for you to get so upset, Gumbah.${prompt}
  11569: Upset? I wasn't upset. But when he said that we didn't need to search for Werei anymore...${prompt}
  11570: How dare he say such things about my friend.${prompt}
  11571: Gumbah...${prompt}
  11572: |-
    This...this is a letter from Werei!
    You say some adventurer had it?${prompt}
  11573: Why would he do this? He could have just talked to me...${prompt}
  11574: I apologize for leaving without any notice, but I can assume that you were already aware of my approaching journey.${prompt}
  11575: Even now as I write this letter, I ponder over whether I should be sending it or not--whether this really is the best thing to do.${prompt}
  11576: Gumbah. You have always embraced your freedom while turning your cheek to any form of responsibility.${prompt}
  11577: However, among men who put too much pride in their race, you stand out as a light of reason.${prompt}
  11578: I know how you must feel. The shock you received when you first realized the weight you must bear...${prompt}
  11579: The weight the Talekeeper must bear...${prompt}
  11580: You knew, Werei! And you didn't say anything...${prompt}
  11581: You thought that after two hundred years of friendship, I wouldn't pick up on something as obvious as that?${prompt}
  11582: However, I respect your will. You did not choose to bear the anger, pain, and suffering of the Galka people.${prompt}
  11583: And it is true that those who have been bestowed with this task--including Raogrimm--have always perished before setting out on their journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  11584: That may be destiny, so I can see why you would be afraid.${prompt}
  11585: But let me say one thing. You may feel lost, but you must remember, there are things that only you can do.${prompt}
  11586: Not that the Talekeeper can do, but that only you, Gumbah, can do. Do not forget this as you follow your path in life.${prompt}
  11587: Only then will you realize why you must carry the two hundred years of Galkan memories.${prompt}
  11588: |-
    I must continue on my journey now. I am looking forward to the day when we can fight again, side by side.
    Do not forget, we shall always be friends.${prompt}
  11589: Werei!${prompt}
  11590: You can come out now, Cornelia. I know you're hiding there.${prompt}
  11591: So, Gumbah, what are you going to do?${prompt}
  11592: Do you think I know?${prompt}
  11593: But I know you, Gumbah, and I know that you aren't going to run away from your destiny, like I have from mine.${prompt}
  11594: You're different from the rest of us. No matter what you decide, I know that you'll face what lies before you. You're the one who taught me that.${prompt}
  11595: I'm sorry... I think I just need to be alone...${prompt}
  11596: Okay, Gumbah...${prompt}
  11597: Why are only adventurers allowed in the Korroloka Tunnel!? How long must we Galka live in the confines of that cramped Hume-hole!?${prompt}
  11598: We mineworkers refuse to be tools of the government!${prompt}
  11599: You only let adventurers pass because there's something down there you don't want us Galka to know about!${prompt}
  11600: We're sick of being lied to by you Humes!${prompt}
  11601: H-hey, calm down...okay?${prompt}
  11602: W-we're just keeping the tunnel closed to protect you...${prompt}
  11603: Huh!? How long do you think you can fool us!?${prompt}
  11604: What is going on here!?${prompt}
  11605: Sir Iron Eater! You must do something. If they would only open this tunnel to us, and not just adventurers, there wouldn't be any problem.${prompt}
  11606: Do these fools understand what they're saying?${prompt}
  11607: Oh! It's Gumbah!${prompt}
  11608: Stop it! All of you!${prompt}
  11609: When are you going to wake up and realize what you are doing is foolish!?${prompt}
  11610: What is at the end of the Korroloka Tunnel? You already know! Nothing but desert! Do you still wish to believe that that is where we belong?${prompt}
  11611: Get out of here, child!${prompt}
  11612: Big talk for such a little kid! So, what are you saying? You've been there?${prompt}
  11613: One hundred years ago...I have.${prompt}
  11614: One hundred years ago!? You've only been around for twenty.${prompt}
  11615: When Werei and I were still young, we snuck by the guards...${prompt}
  11616: When we got through to the other side of the tunnel, all we saw was a vast desert and some sandy ruins.${prompt}
  11617: Is that what you want to call home? Even if you were able to defeat the thousands of Antican warriors, would you really want to live in a place like that?${prompt}
  11618: |-
    But don't you already know the answer?
    When did the Talekeeper have to start making the decisions for everyone?${prompt}
  11619: Gumbah...${prompt}
  11620: Wait... You can't be...${prompt}
  11621: Let me ask you! Are you willing to go to battle with the Antica just to divert your anger from the Humes?${prompt}
  11622: Let me ask you! Do you really think that our home lies in that wasteland on the other side of this tunnel?${prompt}
  11623: Let me ask you! Do we Galka really need a Talekeeper to remember the past?${prompt}
  11624: Yes, there will be days when conflict will arise between us and the Humes. The world seen through their eyes is much different than the world seen through ours.${prompt}
  11625: However, the same is true for all Galka. We all look at the world in a different way. No one in this world is exactly alike.${prompt}
  11626: But there is one thing that can be said, and that is that we are all living together on this planet, Vana'diel. There is nothing that can change that.${prompt}
  11627: Of course people are going to have different morals and ideals, but we all must learn to live together. There is only one Vana'diel!${prompt}
  11628: The Galka future does not lie out in a desert. Bastok is our home!${prompt}
  11629: Raogrimm, Werei, Zeid...they are all gone. However, we no longer need a Talekeeper to remember our past. We can do it ourselves--together.${prompt}
  11630: There is no reason for any of you to rely on a kid who had the rotten luck of getting stuck with two hundred years of memories.${prompt}
  11631: However, if it will help, I will try to do anything that I can--even if it means keeping two centuries of memories.${prompt}
  11632: If that will show you that you don't need a Talekeeper to live happy lives...${prompt}
  11633: Gumbah...${prompt}
  11634: Ha ha. It's been a while since I talked like an adult. It's pretty draining.${prompt}
  11635: Now you can rest in peace...Werei...Raogrimm...${prompt}
  11636: Everybody still looks a little confused. They don't even know how to talk to me.${prompt}
  11637: Well, I don't blame them. The Talekeeper is supposed to be a great, sacred presence. I was probably the last person they'd expect to be the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  11638: But that's okay. They can think of me the way they always have--as an annoying little kid.${prompt}
  11639: I'm not going to treat him any different just because he's the Talekeeper. It must have been hard for him to keep it all inside like he did...${prompt}
  11640: But on the inside, he's still just the jerk that I've known all along! He's not getting any special treatment from me!${prompt}
  11641: I get it now! He was always talking like he was the best because he was the Talekeeper! Hah! Talekeepers--who needs 'em!${prompt}
  11642: I guess we can no longer live by those words anymore...but I never thought that it would be Gumbah who would teach us that.${prompt}
  11643: There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.${prompt}
  11644: It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.${prompt}
  11645: Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.${prompt}
  11646: I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.${prompt}
  11647: Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.${prompt}
  11648: That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.${prompt}
  11649: Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.${prompt}
  11650: Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.${prompt}
  11651: We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.${prompt}
  11652: The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.${prompt}
  11653: 'You''ve been ordered by the president to deliver that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.${prompt}'
  11654: It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.${prompt}
  11655: Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.${prompt}
  11656: As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  11657: You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.${prompt}
  11658: Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.${prompt}
  11659: It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...${prompt}
  11660: I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.${prompt}
  11661: Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.${prompt}
  11662: According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.${prompt}
  11663: The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.${prompt}
  11664: You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.${prompt}

  11678: After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.${prompt}
  11679: Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.${prompt}
  11680: One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.${prompt}
  11681: I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!${prompt}
  11682: I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!${prompt}
  11683: Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.${prompt}
  11684: You are ${name-player}, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.${prompt}
  11685: The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.${prompt}
  11686: I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.${prompt}
  11687: I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.${prompt}
  11688: And one other thing.${prompt}
  11689: One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.${prompt}
  11690: The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a “kabuto.” Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.${prompt}
  11691: You're finally here, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11692: |-
    I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief.
    I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.${prompt}
  11693: To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.${prompt}
  11694: This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.${prompt}
  11695: I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...${prompt}
  11696: You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.${prompt}
  11697: I-it's you...${prompt}
  11698: We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.${prompt}
  11699: Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.${prompt}
  11700: Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...${prompt}
  11701: '.........${prompt}'
  11702: 'He has lost consciousness.${wait-animation: 2}'
  11703: The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...${prompt}
  11704: Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...${prompt}
  11705: Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...${prompt}
  11706: Now there are none who can stand in my way!${prompt}
  11707: What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...${prompt}
  11708: You did it!${prompt}
  11709: The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.${prompt}
  11710: 'Our ancestors'' ${item-singular: 0[2]} has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit''s demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.${prompt}'
  11711: |-
    Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away.
    Until we meet again, ${name-player}!${prompt}

    Thank you...
    And now for your treat...${prompt}
  11719: Here, take this...${prompt}
  11720: If you put this on and walk around, something...unexpected might happen...${prompt}
  11721: Thank you...${prompt}
  11722: If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...${prompt}
  11723: Perfect timing, ${name-player}! I just received a letter from Zeid.${prompt}
  11724: It says, “Do not let Werei's technique fade. Grant his blade unto those who are worthy.”${prompt}
  11725: |-
    Hmmm, I wonder if he means the sword Werei forgot to take with him on his journey...
    Anyway, you look pretty strong. Would you mind trying this out? If you come across anything strange, bring it back to me, and I'll have a look at it.${prompt}
  11726: What's wrong? You didn't go and lose the sword now, did you?${prompt}
  11727: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    No particular reason.
    I went and lost the sword...
    I'm tired of this.${prompt}
  11728: You know, I knew you were going to say that. The sword you “lost” was delivered to my room earlier today. Here, take it.${prompt}
  11729: |-
    What?
    You're not serious, are you?${prompt}
  11730: |-
    Are you serious?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dead serious.
    I was just bluffing.${prompt}
  11731: Oh well, you can keep the sword. Werei left a chest full of these things, and I'm running out of room to store them...${prompt}
  11732: Hm? It doesn't look like anything special has happened yet... Maybe you should use it a little bit longer.${prompt}
  11733: Perfect timing, ${name-player}! I just got another letter from Zeid. He said to give you this if there were any changes in the sword.${prompt}
  11734: |-
    He also wanted me to tell you this: You will acquire Werei's hidden technique only after you've traveled to the Western Altepa Desert and retrieved the ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]}.
    Hmph. If this is so important, why couldn't he just come here and give it to you himself?${prompt}
  11735: |-
    You're back already?
    Well, let's see what you brought back.${prompt}
  11736: Wait a minute... This isn't Werei's technique...${prompt}
  11737: Oh, I see... That's what Zeid was trying to say.${prompt}
  11738: I remember Werei telling me that long ago, the dark knight, Zeid, challenged him to a duel.${prompt}
  11739: Zeid was still young and couldn't match the experience of the elder Werei. However, from his defeat, Zeid was able to devise a powerful new technique.${prompt}
  11740: It was this head-on collision of these two different styles of battle--no, these two different paths in life--from which this new skill was born.${prompt}
  11741: Werei wanted Zeid to realize that it was not only training, but also the crossing of different paths that made a man strong... Even if those paths were never meant to cross again...${prompt}
  11742: You know, ${name-player}. The battles you have fought have probably already taught you some new techniques as well. Use them wisely! Use them wisely!${prompt}

    Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.
    The time left to me is short.
  11762: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt}
  11763: |-
    I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...
    It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt}
  11764: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt}
  11765: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt}
  11766: |-
    My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.
    Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt}
  11767: |-
    Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.
    You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.
    My hopes go with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11768: There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.${prompt}

  11771: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt}
  11772: |-
    I see you have met with Raogrimm.
    His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt}
  11773: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt}
  11774: 'You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana''diel and that other world.${prompt}'

  11777: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt}
  11778: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  11779: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt}
  11780: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt}

  11785: Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...${prompt}
  11786: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  11787: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  11788: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  11789: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  11790: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  11791: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  11792: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}

    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!

    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  11798: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  11799: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  11800: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  11801: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  11802: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  11803: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  11804: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  11805: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  11806: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  11807: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11808: |-
    I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt}
  11809: |-
    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  11810: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  11811: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  11812: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  11813: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  11814: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11815: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  11816: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  11817: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  11818: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  11819: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  11820: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  11821: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  11822: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  11823: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  11824: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  11825: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  11826: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  11827: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  11828: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  11829: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  11830: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11831: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  11832: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  11833: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  11834: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  11835: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  11836: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  11837: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11838: Is it over...?${prompt}
  11839: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  11840: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  11841: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  11842: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}

    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.

  11844: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  11845: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  11846: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}

    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}

  11851: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  11852: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}

    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}

    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}

    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}

    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}

    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}

    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}

    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...

  11870: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt}
  11871: |-
    I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.
    No matter who that person may be.${prompt}
  11872: Raogrimm...${prompt}
  11873: |-
    Are you sure you want to do this?
    This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.

    Raogrimm.
    There is no need to suffer alone anymore.
    Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt}

    There are crimes that must be atoned for.
    And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt}

    Until the dawn of an age without hatred...

  12060: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  12061: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  12062: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  12063: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  12064: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  12065: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  12066: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  12067: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  12068: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  12069: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  12070: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  12071: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  12072: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  12073: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  12074: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  12075: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  12076: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  12077: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  12078: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  12079: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  12080: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  12081: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  12082: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  12083: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  12084: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  12085: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  12086: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  12087: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

    You must be speaking of the Elshimo Campaign.
    Windurst was falsely accuserized by the governments of Bastok and Tavnazia...${prompt}

  12104: Are you telling us that the Moblins started warification on you?${prompt}

    Hmm.
    The Moblins retreated into their city and only emerged to kidnap people and steal books.${prompt}
  12106: |-
    However, they weren't attacking us as such.
    Even the people who were kidnapped were returned unharmed.${prompt}
  12107: Then one Galka decided he would learn the Moblin language and try to reason with them.${prompt}
  12108: |-
    But his attempts ended in failure...
    The Moblins suddenly became hostile and dangerous.${prompt}
  12109: |-
    What a calamity!
    What kind of words were exchangified, I wonder!?${prompt}
  12110: I supposify Galka aren't known for their diplomacy...${prompt}
  12111: |-
    Nobody really knows what passed between them.
    In any case, the battle ended as abruptly as it had begun.${prompt}
  12112: |-
    One morning, we awoke to discover that the tunnel connecting the mines to Movalpolos had completely caved in.
    The Moblins had left.${prompt}
  12113: So they fled, thinking they would be obliteraficated?${prompt}
  12114: |-
    I don't think so.
    Bastok had no formal army. It had come to the point where we had even considered collapsing the Gusgen Mines.${prompt}
  12115: Then, perhaps they had achieverized some goal?${prompt}
  12116: |-
    I don't know.
    The only person who knows what really happened back then would be Jabbos, the Galka who tried talking with the Moblins.${prompt}

  12118: |-
    Nobody knows.
    He disappeared on the first day of our battle with Movalpolos.${prompt}

    I am Virnage, a friar from the San d'Orian Cathedral.
    Coming to Bastok is part of my pilgrimage.${prompt}
  12128: I was permitted to peruse the holy tome that was found in the Moblin lair below North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  12129: |-
    It is, without a doubt, a volume printed by the San d'Orian Cathedral.
    Judging by its relatively unsullied condition, the book appears to have been handled with care and reverence.${prompt}
  12130: If these Moblins truly believe in the grace of the Goddess Altana, I cannot abandon them to the ungentle ministrations of the Republic.${prompt}
  12131: However, it would be foolish of me to venture alone into a beastman lair without further confirmation of their faith.${prompt}
  12132: Would you be willing to discover the truth behind this theological enigma?${prompt}

  12134: |-
    My most humble thanks.
    ...This is a talisman bearing the symbol of the Goddess.${prompt}
  12135: |-
    The same symbol adorns the cover of the holy tome.
    Presenting the talisman to the Moblins should help you determine where their true faith lies.${prompt}
  12136: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} bears the same symbol that adorns the book of worship.
    Presenting this to the Moblins should help you determine where their true faith lies.${prompt}
  12137: |-
    How did you fare?
    Was the talisman well-received?${prompt}
  12138: |-
    Great Goddess!
    You were attacked!?${prompt}
  12139: "Were my hopes in vain? \nThough they did not ally themselves with the Shadow Lord, these Moblins do live in a world without the blessing of light.${prompt}"
  12140: I must conclude that the careful treatment of the holy tome had more to do with its value as a curiosity, rather than as an object of faith.${prompt}
  12141: |-
    However, the symbol of the Dawn Goddess in your possession assured you safe passage back to the surface world.
    Do you not agree?${prompt}
  12142: |-
    What say you?
    I will make you a gift of the talisman in return for a small donation to the cathedral...${prompt}
  12143: |-
    Hm?
    You say the talisman was taken by a Galka that spoke the Moblin tongue?${prompt}
  12144: And he disappeared into the depths of Movalpolos after saving you from the enraged Moblins?${prompt}
  12145: |-
    Hm?
    You say the talisman was taken by a Moblin that spoke the common tongue?${prompt}
  12146: And he mentioned a Galka had taught him how to speak our language?${prompt}
  12147: This Galka must be a person of some importance in the Moblin city.${prompt}
  12148: Perhaps he was the original owner of the holy tome you retrieved.${prompt}
  12149: We must report the existence of this Galka to Ayame of the Mythril Musketeers.${prompt}
  12150: If these beastmen are capable of living alongside people, we cannot simply brand them as villains...${prompt}
  12151: |-
    Please accept your reward.
    May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt}
  12152: I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.${prompt}
  12153: |-
    But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds.
    They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.${prompt}
  12154: When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:${prompt}
  12155: Then what's the difference between animals and people?${prompt}
  12156: |-
    I answered, “People are smarter than animals.”
    And then she retorted, “People sure are more sly!”${prompt}
  12157: |-
    Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me!
    I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.${prompt}
  12158: |-
    People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants.
    This difference is what makes it all worth it.${prompt}
  12159: |-
    There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe.
    But in the end, we all come from the same source.${prompt}
  12160: That's true for both people and animals.${prompt}
  12161: |-
    We all have this thing called a soul.
    The souls of animals are pure and simple.${prompt}
  12162: |-
    Look over there.
    That chocobo is living proof.${prompt}
  12163: |-
    You should ask someone how that chocobo was born.
    Then you'll have your answers.${prompt}

  12165: I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.${prompt}
  12166: Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.${prompt}
  12167: She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.${prompt}
  12168: How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.${prompt}
  12169: I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...${prompt}
  12170: |-
    That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls.
    She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.${prompt}
  12171: She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.${prompt}
  12172: |-
    According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok.
    How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...${prompt}
  12173: |-
    What can I do for you?
    If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.${prompt}
  12174: Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.${prompt}
  12175: |-
    You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands.
    Have a safe journey.${prompt}
  12176: A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?${prompt}
  12177: Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  12178: She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.${prompt}
  12179: The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.${prompt}
  12180: For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.${prompt}
  12181: I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.${prompt}
  12182: Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.${prompt}
  12183: In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...${prompt}
  12184: |-
    But then one day, Silver Comet was gone.
    Some chocobo thief had stolen her.${prompt}
  12185: |-
    Hm?
    You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables?
    You must be mistaken.${prompt}
  12186: Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.${prompt}
  12187: He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.${prompt}
  12188: That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.${prompt}
  12189: If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.${prompt}
  12190: |-
    He's given up the adventuring life, it seems.
    Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.${prompt}
  12191: The gate is locked.${prompt}
  12192: |-
    Whaddaya want?
    I got no time for adventurers.${prompt}
  12193: |-
    Huh? Where'd you hear...
    Well, whatever.${prompt}
  12194: You say you got business with me?${prompt}
  12195: |-
    Silver Comet...
    What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for?
    You some kind of crackpot?${prompt}
  12196: Leave me alone, you loon.${prompt}
  12197: "Can't you see I'm busy? \nThis place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.${prompt}"
  12198: |-
    Hold up a minute.
    If you bring me some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I might be willing to give you the time of day.${prompt}
  12199: |-
    Yep, three of those ought to do it.
    I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.${prompt}
  12200: |-
    You brought what I asked for?
    Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.${prompt}
  12201: |-
    It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see.
    Helps me get around.${prompt}
  12202: |-
    Now, then.
    You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?${prompt}
  12203: |-
    She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable.
    I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.${prompt}
  12204: |-
    I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge.
    That chocobo wasn't right in the head.${prompt}
  12205: |-
    She threw herself headlong into the marshes.
    Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
  12206: When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.${prompt}
  12207: That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.${prompt}
  12208: |-
    That general's a real schemer.
    Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.${prompt}
  12209: It's his fault I almost got killed!${prompt}
  12210: |-
    Huh?
    Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.${prompt}
  12211: Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.${prompt}
  12212: Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.${prompt}
  12213: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses.
    I'll see you around, adventurer.${prompt}
  12214: Were you able to meet with that adventurer?${prompt}
  12215: |-
    ...Is that right?
    I think you were around that ${item-singular: 1[2]} a bit too long.${prompt}
  12216: It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.${prompt}
  12217: Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.${prompt}
  12218: |-
    You mentioned a “Shooting Star”?
    I know that name.${prompt}
  12219: |-
    That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet.
    Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.${prompt}
  12220: Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.${prompt}
  12221: |-
    I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh.
    The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.${prompt}
  12222: |-
    Hm?
    Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?${prompt}
  12223: |-
    I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken.
    I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.${prompt}
  12224: He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  12225: |-
    But, wait.
    I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus.
    He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...${prompt}
  12226: Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?${prompt}
  12227: You are being attacked!${prompt}
  12228: Now is not the time for that!${prompt}
  12229: You sense something is not quite right...${prompt}
  12230: You find nothing.${prompt}
  12231: I...I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
  12232: |-
    Wow...
    So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?${prompt}
  12233: I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.${prompt}
  12234: So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  12235: That collar...!?${prompt}
  12236: |-
    You've dug pretty far into this old story.
    Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.${prompt}
  12237: Please don't be angry, Brutus.${prompt}
  12238: I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.${prompt}
  12239: There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.${prompt}
  12240: I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.${prompt}
  12241: Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.${prompt}
  12242: Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.${prompt}
  12243: Really!?${prompt}
  12244: Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.${prompt}
  12245: He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.${prompt}
  12246: But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.${prompt}
  12247: We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.${prompt}
  12248: But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.${prompt}
  12249: Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.${prompt}
  12250: She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.${prompt}
  12251: It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.${prompt}
  12252: |-
    But she never gave up.
    She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.${prompt}
  12253: |-
    Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands.
    She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.${prompt}
  12254: That's when I took off her collar and set her free.${prompt}
  12255: What happened to them after that?${prompt}
  12256: Did they live happily ever after?${prompt}
  12257: |-
    That's right.
    And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.${prompt}
  12258: What a great story...${prompt}
  12259: |-
    It's not over yet.
    The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.${prompt}
  12260: "That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today. \nYou want to keep that chocobo safe, right?${prompt}"
  12261: Right!${prompt}
  12262: I'll never tell, I promise!${prompt}
  12263: |-
    Glad to hear it.
    And one more thing...${prompt}
  12264: Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.${prompt}
  12265: Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.${prompt}
  12266: |-
    Right.
    That's because animals come from the same source as people.${prompt}
  12267: |-
    Adventurer, you can have this.
    Keep this story to yourself.${prompt}
  12268: |-
    Thank you so much!
    And this is from me.${prompt}
  12269: I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.${prompt}
  12270: I would like to meet her again some day...${prompt}
  12271: Press any button to continue.${prompt}
  12272: I'd like to start my own business someday, but I just haven't found anything that truly interests me.${prompt}
  12273: |-
    Rare Tavnazian imports!
    Get them before they're gone!${prompt}
  12274: I'd love to sell you goods imported from the island of Tavnazia, but with the area under foreign control, I can't secure my trade routes...${prompt}
  12275: |-
    Hey!
    You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right?
    Take this letter to that ${choice: 2}[cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?${prompt}

    Excuse me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady].

  12283: |-
    Wow! Another present!
    Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?${prompt}
  12284: |-
    Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent?
    You're starrrting to scare me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]...${prompt}
  12285: I just accepted a gift from you, kind ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.${prompt}

    Hi there! I'm a smilebringer!
    I've come from a faraway land to the north to bring joy and happiness to the children of Vana'diel!
    You look a little old for presents, though.${prompt}
  12290: Here, take this and give it to a child. Not only will it make her feel better, but you'll feel better, too!${prompt}
  12291: Trust me!${prompt}
  12292: They say you can't buy happiness with money...but you can get pretty close!${prompt}
  12293: |-
    What? Letters?
    They must be from the impoverished republican tykes!${prompt}
  12294: |-
    Wait a minute... There is no name on this ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    I wonder who wrote it...${prompt}

    Well, I'll be!
    You see, this just proves my theory: ”You only get what you give!”${prompt}

    Wait...
    Was that a twinkle I just saw in your eye?
    Don't tell me... You'd like to help bring joy and happiness to the children of Vana'diel!${prompt}
  12301: |-
    I knew it!
    Well, if you're going to join our ranks, you'll have to play the part. Here, take this hat.
    You could call it our official smilebringer “uniform.” Without it, you're just another average Joe.${prompt}
  12302: |-
    Well, I'll be!
    It's stuff like this that makes it all worthwhile.${prompt}
  12303: Bastok's trees are the best in Vana'diel, and don't let anybody tell you they're not--especially those fruity Moogles in San d'Oria, kupo!${prompt}
  12304: |-
    Bastok's trees are the best in Vana'diel because we use nothing but the best materials!
    Now take this and hurry back to the craftsman before he has both our heads, kupo!${prompt}
  12305: I told you to hurry, kupo!${prompt}
  12306: Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?${prompt}
  12307: Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!${prompt}
  12308: You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.${prompt}
  12309: This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.${prompt}
  12310: But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!${prompt}
  12311: It's just not fair, kupo!${prompt}
  12312: Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!${prompt}
  12313: |-
    And that's why we need your help, kupo!
    Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?${prompt}
  12314: There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!${prompt}
  12315: 'For starters, why don''t you try finding ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!${prompt}'
  12316: |-
    Great! A whole set, kupo!
    Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole.
    Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  12317: |-
    If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo!
    We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!${prompt}
  12318: |-
    Wow! Another set!
    You don't know how much this means to us, kupo!
    Here, take this!${prompt}
  12319: |-
    Have you seen the decorations?
    The Doll Festival has started, kupo!${prompt}
  12320: I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.${prompt}
  12321: Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.${prompt}
  12322: |-
    Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well?
    We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!${prompt}
  12323: |-
    It looks like you have all the members you need.
    Time for the festival to begin, kupo!${prompt}
  12324: |-
    After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival.
    Here, you take one as well, kupo!${prompt}
  12325: It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!${prompt}
  12326: In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!${prompt}
  12327: As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, “resourcefulness,” I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!${prompt}
  12328: |-
    Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress.
    Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!${prompt}
  12329: |-
    And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor.
    I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!${prompt}
  12330: |-
    Kupo!?
    Something's not right...
    Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!${prompt}
  12331: |-
    Kupo...
    I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.${prompt}

    Kupo?
    What happened to your ten-person party?
    You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!${prompt}
  12337: |-
    Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!
    Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt}
  12338: |-
    You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.
    Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  12339: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has different members all of a sudden!
    Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt}
  12340: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!
    You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt}
  12341: |-
    Hmm...
    You seem to have lost your male element.
    Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt}
  12342: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt}
  12343: |-
    You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.
    Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt}
  12344: We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt}
  12345: |-
    Have you seen one?
    ${selection-lines}
    Indeed I have.
    I'm not quite sure...${prompt}
  12346: |-
    Aha, so you have firsthand experience.
    You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt}
  12347: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt}
  12348: |-
    My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.
    Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt}
  12349: |-
    I wish to know about the ENM in...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere in particular.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.
    Monarch Linn.
    The Shrouded Maw.
    Mine Shaft #2716.
    Bearclaw Pinnacle.
    Boneyard Gully.${prompt}
  12350: 'You won''t be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt}'
  12351: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt}
  12352: |-
    You have no need of my expertise at the moment?
    Very well.${prompt}
  12353: And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt}
  12354: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt}
  12355: |-
    These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.
    They must be destroyed.${prompt}
  12356: I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...${prompt}
  12357: Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.${prompt}
  12358: I hope I have been of some assistance to you.${prompt}
  12359: |-
    This dark plague grows ever stronger...
    If it is not stopped soon...${prompt}
  12360: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  12361: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  12362: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  12363: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  12364: But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt}
  12365: |-
    Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}
  12366: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain''s aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt}'
  12367: Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  12368: |-
    By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.
    They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt}
  12369: |-
    Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt}
  12370: 'If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  12371: Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}

    I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!
    Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}

    Festival time, kupo～!!!
    We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!${prompt}
  12376: |-
    Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!
    First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt}
  12377: After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt}
  12378: However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt}
  12379: At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt}
  12380: Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt}
  12381: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt}
  12382: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.
    If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!${prompt}
  12383: Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?${prompt}
  12384: |-
    Play the game?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready to go!
    I'll pass.${prompt}
  12385: When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt}
  12386: If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt}
  12387: Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt}
  12388: |-
    Well, kupo?
    You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt}

    Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, freedom!
    I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt}

    Your game has been cancelled.
    If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  12391: Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  12392: This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!${prompt}
  12393: |-
    You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!
    Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt}
  12394: We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo～!${prompt}
  12395: 'The direction of your partner''s checkpoint is ${choice: 0}[east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!${prompt}'

  12397: You see something lying on the ground!${prompt}
  12398: You cannot check any more checkpoints.${prompt}
  12399: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  12400: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  12401: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  12402: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  12403: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  12404: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!
    Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt}
  12405: It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt}
  12406: We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt}
  12407: We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt}
  12408: Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt}
  12409: There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt}
  12410: You'll help us out, kupo?${prompt}
  12411: |-

    What's the best way to make a child smile? Why, presents, of course!
    Children nowadays want all kinds of goodies. I'm a bit behind the times, so I'm afraid I can't offer any good advice as to what would be the best present.${prompt}

  12465: We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!${prompt}
  12466: 'Here''s what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.${prompt}'
  12467: There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!${prompt}
  12468: When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.${prompt}
  12469: You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.${prompt}
  12470: Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.${prompt}
  12471: When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.${prompt}
  12472: If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!${prompt}
  12473: Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo～.${prompt}
  12474: We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!${prompt}
  12475: Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!${prompt}
  12476: After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  12477: While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho～!${prompt}

  12548: If you can get your hands on some Near Eastern alchemy products, I bet they'd sell for a nice amount of gil here.${prompt}
  12549: Beastmen are the same all over Vana'diel. All they ever do is cause trouble.${prompt}
  12550: A mercenary could take care of them, though...not a bad choice of profession.${prompt}

    Good of you to drop by the Bat's Lair Inn!

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt}
  12559: The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  12560: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  12561: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}

    Want to know more?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fill me in!
    I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt}
  12569: To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt}
  12570: So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt}
  12571: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  12572: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}
  12573: The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt}
  12574: What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt}
  12575: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  12576: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  12577: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  12578: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  12579: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  12580: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  12581: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}
  12582: You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt}
  12583: Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt}

    Where'd your partner go?${prompt}

    Leave town?

    Not yet...${prompt}
  12597: Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt}
  12598: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  12599: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  12600: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}
  12601: Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt}
  12602: 'Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}'

  12607: Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt}
  12608: Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}

  12610: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.'
  12611: You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt}

    Yes, please.

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}
  12615: As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}

    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  12620: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  12621: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend.

  12875: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}

  12882: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  12883: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  12884: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  12885: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  12886: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  12887: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  12888: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  12889: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  12890: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  12891: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  12892: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  12893: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  12894: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12895: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  12896: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12897: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  12898: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  12899: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12900: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  12901: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  12902: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  12903: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  12904: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  12905: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  12906: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  12907: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  12908: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  12909: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  12910: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  12911: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  12912: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}
  12913: You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12915: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  12916: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  12917: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  12918: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  12919: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  12920: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  12921: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  12922: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  12923: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  12924: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  12925: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  12926: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  12927: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  12928: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12930: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  12931: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  12932: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  12933: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  12934: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  12935: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  12936: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  12938: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  12939: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  12940: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  12941: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  12942: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  12943: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  12944: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  12945: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  12946: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  12947: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  12948: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  12949: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  12950: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  12951: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  12952: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  12953: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  12954: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  12955: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12958: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  12959: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  12960: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  12961: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  12962: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  12963: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  12964: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  12965: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  12966: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  12967: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  12968: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12969: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  12970: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  12971: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  12972: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  12973: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12974: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  12975: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12976: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  12977: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

    Ahhh, the pain! The sheer agony!
    Here I stand on the verge of the single greatest breakthrough in the long and storied history of the alchemical arts, and--the Twilight God take me--I lack for the key ingredient necessary to consummate my life's work!
    If only--${prompt}
  14138: |-
    Wait...could it be!? That battle-ready posture! That confident mien!
    No, no, you needn't tell me! You're an adventurer, come to help a troubled genius in his time of dire need!

    I knew it!
    My wits are as sharp as ever, if I say so myself--which I just did!${prompt}

  14143: |-
    At any rate, here is the task I would entrust to you.
    Certainly an adventurer of your caliber has heard of--perhaps even set foot in--the mountainous crags that lie beyond Gustaberg: the area they call Grauberg.${prompt}
  14144: |-
    It is there, sleeping in the bed of a river that runs beneath a mountain vast, that one can find a very special variety of gold dust, imbued with just a speck, a smidgen, a sliver of magical energy!
    ...Or so they say.${prompt}
  14145: |-
    I would ask you to venture to Grauberg and retrieve this vital ingredient for me, that the world--nay, the universe--might reap the harvest sown by the seeds of my immense genius!
    What say you, adventurer?${prompt}

    What say you?

    Leave it to me!
    I say do your own work.${prompt}

    What!? I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share in a groundbreaking moment that will go down in the annals of science, and you would simply walk away!?
    I know not what vile madness takes you, ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], but may the Goddess have mercy on your soul!${prompt}
  14148: |-
    Ah, excellent! Excellent!
    I knew it from the start--clearly, you're a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] with a sense for history in the making!${prompt}

  14151: |-
    Bring them back here in this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, and prepare to bear witness to the dawning of a new era in alchemy!
    You'll want to ready yourself a pair of shaded spectacles, 'cause the future is going to be bright, bright, bright!${prompt}
  14152: |-
    My adventuring friend! Have you managed to secure the enchanted gold dust I seek?
    Why, we mustn't keep the world waiting any longer--a truly epoch-making moment hangs in the balance!${prompt}
  14153: |-
    How to get to Grauberg, you ask? Come to think of it, the path leading there has been obstructed for as long as I can remember.
    But hey, you're the adventurer--I'm sure you'll figure something out!
    Now, chop chop!${prompt}
  14154: |-
    Wait, could it be!? That self-satisfied expression! That sprightly gait!
    No, no, don't tell me, now! You've returned triumphant with the ingredient I seek!
    Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  14155: |-
    Spectacular! So pure, and simply oozing with magical energy!
    To think that such immaculate specimens remain in this day and age...${prompt}
  14156: To tell the truth, I had my doubts that a scruffy-looking straggler like you could pull it off, but you've far exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations!${prompt}
  14157: |-
    But why am I standing around chit-chatting with the help when there's history to be made!?
    Behold as I unveil the first step of the process that will redefine our glorious discipline!${prompt}
  14158: |-
    Bwahahaha! Yes...yes!
    All is proceeding precisely according to plan!${prompt}
  14159: Now all I do is take the refined gold dust--like so--and a shiny new weapon specially prepared by our guild for this momentous occasion, and...${prompt}
  14160: |-
    History, here I come!
    Genius has a new name, and that name is Titus!${prompt}
  14161: |-
    What...? No! It couldn't be!?
    Failure!? I've failed!?
    Oh, unmerciful Goddess, how you torture me so!${prompt}
  14162: |-
    Oh, alas and alack! Years of research for naught!
    Am I destined to live out the rest of my life as a nobody!?
    A grimy lump of fool's gold to be trodden beneath the feet of my more accomplished peers!?
    Woe, oh woe is me...!${prompt}
  14163: |-
    You're still here?
    Pray leave me. I am a failure, a nothing, a nobody!
    I cannot bear to have anyone look upon my wretched self!${prompt}
  14164: |-
    Hmm? What's that you say?
    Why, what have we here!? Though the synthesis failed, the materials are miraculously intact...!?${prompt}

    What luck! What fortune! The Goddess smiles upon her poor Titus after all!
    Stand back, friend! I've been given another chance at history, and I mean to make the most of it!${prompt}
  14166: |-
    Eureka! I've done it!
    I've truly done it!${prompt}
  14167: |-
    I really am a genius! Why, I never doubted myself for a second!
    See how it glows with unearthly power! Truly an achievement that will be celebrated by alchemists--nay, by enlightened beings the world over--for ages to come!${prompt}
  14168: |-
    What does it do, you say?
    Why, it imbues a potent dose of alchemical skill to anyone who wears it!
    Amazing, is it not?${prompt}
  14169: Think of it as my way of sharing just a smidge--a trifle, mind you--of my limitless genius to the less intellectually endowed! Ha-ha!${prompt}
  14170: |-
    And for your contributions to this glorious day, you may consider it yours!
    A round of applause for the good ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]!${prompt}
  14171: It's just a prototype, mind you, and there are still a few kinks to be worked out, but hey, let's not sweat the details!${prompt}
  14172: |-
    That glowing smile! That awestruck expression!
    Don't tell me--you're simply overjoyed to own a piece of history.
    Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  14173: |-
    Anyhow, it's back to work for me. This is one genius who isn't going to rest on his laurels!
    And don't be leaving town, okay? After all, it shall only be a matter of time before my next groundbreaking discovery!${prompt}
  14174: What? You say you've got my chocobo!?${prompt}

  14210: Greetings. I am a journeyman trainer from the VCS, and I have been sent to this town to promote knowledge exchange between chocobo owners.${prompt}
  14211: We believe that the best way to promote interaction between owners is through interaction between chocobos.${prompt}
  14212: And after countless VCS conferences, we recently agreed on the establishment of a new program--${prompt}
  14213: Kamp Kweh!${prompt}
  14214: |-

    Nothing at all.${prompt}
  14217: Kamp Kweh is a place where fellow breeders can bring their chocobos to interact with each other.${prompt}
  14218: At the camp, owners can check the status of their companions' animals...${prompt}
  14219: '...as well as confirm breeding compatibility.${prompt}'
  14220: However, please note that any results from these tests are merely estimates, and may not fully reflect the actual condition of an animal.${prompt}

  14222: Only adventurers who are currently raising a chocobo can participate.${prompt}
  14223: Owners can enroll their animals once they have hatched.${prompt}
  14224: To begin, adventurers should first form a party of those who wish to participate, and then come talk to me or any of the other VCS journeyman trainers stationed throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14225: Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.${prompt}
  14226: We refuse admission to the following:${prompt}
  14227: 1. Any owners who have not checked up on their chocobos recently. Those who feel that they may have been neglecting their animal may want to visit the stables before attempting to participate.${prompt}
  14228: 2. Chocobos who are sleeping or have run away.${prompt}
  14229: 3. Chocobos who have yet to be named.${prompt}
  14230: 4. Party members who are too far away from the stables.${prompt}
  14231: We would not think of leading a chocobo away from its pen when the owner was not present.${prompt}

  14233: |-
    Enroll?
    ${selection-lines}

  14236: None of the other members of your party possess chocobos able to participate in camp activities. Please confirm their conditions and speak with me again when everything is in order.${prompt}
  14237: None of your party members are close enough to the stables to participate in camp activities. Please speak with me again when everyone has assembled.${prompt}
  14238: Now that we have arrived, we can begin.${prompt}

  14415: As you probably already know, your chocobo has a nose for finding buried goods. A “third” sense, you could call it.${prompt}
  14416: Depending on the distance you are from the treasure, the reaction of your bird will change.${prompt}
  14417: When you think you've found the X that marks the proverbial spot...${prompt}

  14420: But with a cup of persistence and a 1/4 tablespoon of luck, you'll uncover a chest filled with surprises that even Pandora would appreciate.${prompt}
  14421: Then, all you have to do is open it and pocket your prize. It's as easy as Rolanberry pie!${prompt}
  14422: To maximize your “hot” and ice your “cold,” you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can help you get your eyes off, and your hands on, the prize.${prompt}
  14423: The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt}
  14424: Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest before your bird grows too tired.${prompt}
  14425: Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easier by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt}
  14426: Now, this part is the most important, so I need you to turn off your linkshell and give me your undivided attention.${prompt}
  14427: All this digging can put a lot of strain on your chocobo.${prompt}
  14428: The more you order your bird to dig, the more tired it will become. Overwork it, and it will simply give up and refuse to dig anymore.${prompt}
  14429: If that's the case, you'll have to hop off your chocobo and let it recover. In other words it's game over, man. Game over!${prompt}
  14430: Locating the chest in as few digs as possible will be the key to everybody going home happy.${prompt}
  14431: Trust me.${prompt}

  14483: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  14484: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  14485: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  14486: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  14487: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  14488: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  14489: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  14490: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  14491: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  14492: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  14493: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  14494: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  14495: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  14496: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  14497: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  14498: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  14499: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  14500: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  14501: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  14502: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  14503: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  14504: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  14505: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  14506: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14507: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  14508: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  14509: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  14510: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  14511: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  14512: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'
  14513: Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
  14514: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'

  14775: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  14776: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  14777: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}
  14778: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt}
  14779: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  14780: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

  14784: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  14785: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  14791: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  14792: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  14793: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  14794: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  14795: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  14796: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  14797: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14798: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  14799: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  14800: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  14801: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  14802: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  14803: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  14804: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  14805: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  14806: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  14807: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  14808: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  14809: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  14810: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14811: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  14812: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  14813: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  14814: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  14815: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  14816: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  14817: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  14818: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  14819: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  14821: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  14822: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  14823: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  14824: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  14825: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  14826: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  14827: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  14828: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  14829: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  14830: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  14831: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  14832: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  14833: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  14834: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  14835: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  14836: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  14837: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  14838: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  14839: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  14841: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  14842: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  14843: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  14844: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  14845: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  14846: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  14847: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  14848: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  14849: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  14850: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  14851: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  14852: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  14853: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  14854: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  14855: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  14856: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  14857: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  14858: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  14859: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  14860: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  14861: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  14862: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  14863: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

    Which would you like to hear about?
    ${selection-lines}
    CRA rationale behind veteran races.
    How do I register for a race?
    How do I prepare for a race?
    What are ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}?
    What kinds of races are there?
    What are “racing teams”?
    What about race opponents?
    Quit.
    Return.${prompt}
  14926: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  14927: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  14928: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  14929: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  14930: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  14931: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  14932: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  14933: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  14934: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  14935: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  14936: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  14937: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  14938: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  14939: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  14940: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  14941: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  14942: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  14943: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  14944: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  14945: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  14946: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  14947: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  14948: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  14949: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14950: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  14951: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  14952: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  14953: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  14954: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  14955: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  14956: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  14957: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  14958: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  14959: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  14960: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  15032: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  15033: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  15034: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  15035: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  15036: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  15037: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}

  15068: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  15069: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  15070: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  15071: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  15072: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  15073: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  15074: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  15075: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  15076: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  15077: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  15078: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  15079: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  15080: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  15081: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  15082: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  15083: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  15084: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  15085: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  15086: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  15087: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  15088: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  15089: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  15090: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  15091: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  15092: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  15093: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  15094: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  15095: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  15096: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  15097: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  15098: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  15099: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  15100: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  15101: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  15102: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  15103: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  15104: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  15105: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  15106: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  15107: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  15108: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  15109: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  15110: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  15111: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  15112: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  15113: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  15114: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  15115: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  15116: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  15117: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  15118: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  15119: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  15120: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  15121: And they're off!
  15122: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  15123: Well, I fel--
  15124: ピヨピヨッ！
  15125: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  15126: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  15127: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  15128: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  15129: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  15130: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  15131: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  15132: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  15133: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  15134: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  15135: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  15136: ピヨピヨ！
  15137: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  15138: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  15139: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  15140: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  15141: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  15142: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  15143: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  15144: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  15145: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15146: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15147: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  15148: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  15149: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  15150: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  15151: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  15152: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  15153: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  15154: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  15155: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  15156: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  15157: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  15158: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  15159: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  15160: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  15161: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  15162: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  15163: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  15164: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  15165: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  15166: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  15167: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  15168: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  15169: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  15170: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  15171: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  15172: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  15173: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  15174: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  15175: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  15176: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  15177: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  15178: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  15179: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  15180: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  15181: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  15182: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  15183: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  15184: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  15185: Until next time, race fans...
  15186: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  15187: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  15188: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  15189: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  15190: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  15191: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  15192: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  15193: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  15194: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  15209: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  15210: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  15211: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  15212: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  15213: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  15214: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  15215: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  15216: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  15217: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  15218: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  15219: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  15220: But...?${prompt}
  15221: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  15222: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  15223: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  15224: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  15225: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  15226: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  15227: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  15228: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  15229: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  15230: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  15231: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  15232: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  15233: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  15234: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  15235: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  15236: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  15237: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  15238: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  15239: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  15240: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  15241: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  15242: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  15243: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  15244: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  15245: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  15246: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  15247: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  15248: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  15249: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  15250: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  15251: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  15252: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  15253: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  15254: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  15255: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  15256: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  15257: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  15258: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  15259: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  15260: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  15261: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  15262: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  15263: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  15264: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  15265: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  15266: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  15267: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  15268: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  15269: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  15270: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  15271: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  15272: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  15273: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  15274: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  15275: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  15276: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  15277: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  15278: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  15279: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  15280: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  15281: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  15282: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  15283: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  15284: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  15285: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  15286: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  15287: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  15288: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  15289: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15290: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  15291: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  15292: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  15293: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  15294: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  15295: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  15296: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  15297: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15298: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15299: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  15300: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  15301: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  15302: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  15303: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  15304: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15305: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  15306: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  15307: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  15308: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  15309: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  15310: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  15311: '...${prompt}'
  15312: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  15313: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  15314: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  15315: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  15316: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  15317: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  15318: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  15319: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  15320: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  15321: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  15322: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  15323: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  15324: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  15325: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  15326: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  15327: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  15328: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  15329: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  15330: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  15331: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  15332: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  15333: '...${prompt}'
  15334: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  15335: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  15336: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  15337: What's more...${prompt}
  15338: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  15339: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  15340: What...?${prompt}
  15341: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  15342: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  15343: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  15344: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  15345: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  15346: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15347: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  15348: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  15349: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  15350: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  15351: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  15352: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  15353: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  15354: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  15355: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  15356: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  15357: And they're off!
  15358: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  15359: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  15360: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  15361: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  15362: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  15363: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  15364: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  15365: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  15366: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  15367: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  15368: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  15369: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  15370: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  15371: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  15372: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  15373: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  15374: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  15375: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  15376: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  15377: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  15378: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  15379: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  15380: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  15381: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  15382: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  15383: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  15384: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  15385: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  15386: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  15387: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  15388: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  15389: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  15390: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  15391: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  15392: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  15393: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  15394: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  15395: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  15396: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  15397: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  15398: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  15399: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  15400: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  15401: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  15402: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  15403: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  15404: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  15405: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  15406: |-
    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  15407: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}
  15408: |-
    Where would you like to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  15409: See you again, kupo!${prompt}
  15410: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  15411: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  15412: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}
  15413: |-
    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  15414: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  15415: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  15416: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  15417: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  15418: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  15419: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  15420: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  15421: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  15422: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  15423: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  15424: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  15425: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  15426: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  15427: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  15428: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  15429: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  15430: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  15431: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15432: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  15433: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  15434: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  15435: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  15436: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  15437: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Doing what?
    Not today.${prompt}
  15438: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  15439: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  15440: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  15441: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  15442: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  15443: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  15444: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  15445: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  15446: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  15447: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  15448: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  15449: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  15450: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  15451: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  15452: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  15453: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  15454: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  15455: Kupopo...${prompt}
  15456: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}

    Trading cinder.${prompt}
  15690: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  15691: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  15692: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  15693: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  15694: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  15695: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  15696: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  15697: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  15698: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  15699: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  15700: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  15701: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  15702: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  15703: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  15704: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15705: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  15706: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  15707: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  15708: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  15709: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  15710: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  15711: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  15712: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  15713: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15714: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  15715: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  15716: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  15717: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  15718: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  15719: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  15720: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  15721: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  15722: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  15723: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  15724: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  15725: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  15726: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  15727: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  15728: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  15729: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  15730: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  15731: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  15732: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  15733: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  15734: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  15735: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}

    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  15737: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  15738: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  15739: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  15740: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  15741: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  15742: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  15743: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  15744: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  15745: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  15746: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  15747: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  15748: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  15749: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  15750: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  15751: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  15752: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  15753: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  15754: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  15755: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  15756: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  15757: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  15758: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  15759: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  15760: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  15761: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  15762: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  15763: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  15764: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  15765: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  15766: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  15767: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  15768: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  15769: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  15770: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  15771: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  15772: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  15773: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  15794: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  15795: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  15796: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  15797: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  15798: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  15799: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  15800: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  15801: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  15802: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  15803: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  16210: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  16211: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  16212: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  16213: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  16214: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  16215: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  16216: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  16217: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  16218: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  16219: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  16220: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  16221: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  16222: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  16223: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  16224: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  16225: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  16226: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  16227: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  16228: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  16229: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  16230: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16231: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  16232: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  16233: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  16234: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  16235: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  16236: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  16237: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  16238: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  16239: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  16240: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  16241: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  16242: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  16243: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16244: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  16245: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  16246: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  16247: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  16248: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  16249: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  16250: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  16251: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  16252: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  16253: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  16254: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  16255: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  16256: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  16257: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  16258: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  16259: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  16260: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  16261: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  16262: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  16263: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  16264: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  16265: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}

  16279: Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.${prompt}
  16280: In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt}

  16287: My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.${prompt}
  16288: Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt}
  16289: But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.${prompt}

  16310: The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt}

  16312: Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt}
  16313: Old gods? New?${prompt}
  16314: No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt}

  16528: Ahh... I see you have met with her.${prompt}
  16529: Of course, I heard the story about a special shield that can improve your crafting ability when equipped. Hahaha. I have no idea how it works though.${prompt}
  16530: Although, if the theory behind it is sound and it actually works, I would be quite interested to know more about it.${prompt}
  16531: I am well-versed in your abilities, and if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you just might have what it takes to make the shield.${prompt}
  16532: Now then, we will first need to go over the recipe. It is important that you remember this, so listen carefully, take notes, do whatever it is you need to do.${prompt}
  16533: 'So, the first ingredient you are going to need is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  16534: 'The function of this particular ingredient is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt}'
  16535: I actually have some information regarding Craftsmanship. I will read it out loud for you before you get started.${prompt}
  16536: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  16537: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  16538: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  16539: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  16540: Did you get all of that?${prompt}
  16541: 'Once you have got the Craftsmanship rating up, come show me how you did. Then, I will be able to make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16542: 'After that, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, which you can get from Yek Falimeygo.${prompt}'
  16543: You have delivered various items to people before, right? That is basically what you will need to do to get those ingredients.${prompt}
  16544: Go speak to Yek Falimeygo for more information.${prompt}
  16545: That covers the ingredients you need. Be sure to show me the shield once you have upgraded it. I am very interested to see how it turns out.${prompt}
  16546: Hm? You forgot the recipe already? Okay, here are the materials you need, but a craftsman of your caliber really should be able to remember these things.${prompt}
  16547: You promised that we would always work together to improve our crafting skill. If anybody can do this, I am certain that it is you.${prompt}
  16548: 'Impressive... I think you have successfully demonstrated the process. This should enable me to produce the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  16549: 'So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  16550: By pouring my heart and soul into the shield, I was able to form this crystal. Although the theory behind the process is quite straightforward, it still amazes me to see it in action.${prompt}
  16551: 'Hmm... In crafting the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems to have decreased the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16552: 'It is no problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you will need to raise its Craftsmanship first if you wish to craft the ${item-singular: 0[2]} again.${prompt}'
  16553: Well, I know you are quite responsible and I am certain there is no way you could ever lose something so important.${prompt}
  16554: 'What did you say? You somehow managed to lose the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? How is that even possible?${prompt}'
  16555: 'I even warned you about such a thing, too... Okay, give me the shield. I will craft another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  16556: You are a highly-skilled craftsman. As such, you need to make sure you take care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  16557: It looks like you managed to make the upgrade. Let me see how you did.${prompt}
  16558: Hmm... The shape has changed and I can feel a small amount of power emanating from it. Yet, it is still not enough to prove the theory.${prompt}
  16559: I suppose it is just as she said it would be. Unless you craft with it multiple times, you will not get the results that you are expecting.${prompt}
  16560: That reminds me, she wanted some kind of proof that the shield was done. Here, wait just a moment...${prompt}
  16561: That should do it.${prompt}
  16562: Just show the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  16563: Lastly, please note that I always have deliveries to be made to Yek Falimeygo. I hope you will help train and educate the junior members of our guild.${prompt}
  16564: Ah, it's good to see you. She's already told me about your next task.${prompt}
  16565: Now, let's go over this new recipe, shall we? Pay attention, you're going to want to remember this.${prompt}
  16566: There you go. Did you get all of that?${prompt}
  16567: 'Next, let''s go over how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16568: 'First, you''ll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and craft with it until its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt}'
  16569: 'It''s just the same as when we made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} before. However, you''re going to need to make even more of an effort this time.${prompt}'
  16570: 'Bring me the shield once it''s reached 100% and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  16571: 'Next up is the ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from last time? I''ve given both it and the ${item-singular: 2[2]} to Yek Falimeygo.${prompt}'
  16572: 'Next up is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. I''ve partnered with the A.M.A.N. to create some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  16573: 'You can check the Records of Eminence menu for more details. You''ll receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once the objectives are complete.${prompt}'
  16574: That covers the ingredients. You know, it takes hard work and dedication to prove a theory like this is valid. That's why you're the perfect person for this job.${prompt}
  16575: Hmm... It looks like you were successful.${prompt}
  16576: 'I guess that means it''s my turn. Here, I''ll make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you now.${prompt}'
  16577: Okay, all finished.${prompt}
  16578: Hmm... It looks like the shield's Craftsmanship has dropped again.${prompt}
  16579: You need to take proper care of this thing so you don't need to come back to me again.${prompt}
  16580: I must say, you never cease to amaze me. Well done.${prompt}
  16581: You can really feel the difference compared to the previous shield. Its power is only going to increase as you unlock its potential.${prompt}
  16582: Okay, let me mark the shield to prove the process is complete.${prompt}
  16583: That should do it. Take the shield and show it to Mewk Chorosap.${prompt}
  16584: I see you don't give up so easily. Very well. You may attempt the final objective once more.${prompt}
  16585: Ahh... There you are. Shall we go over the next recipe, then?${prompt}
  16586: Oh, you already know it? Forgive me.${prompt}
  16587: 'Okay, you would like to know how to obtain the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}? Very well. Listen carefully.${prompt}'
  16588: Our guild has received an order for a particular item, but I need you to fulfill the order for me.${prompt}
  16589: However, this one's a bit of a strange request, you see... Although there are a few exceptions, you need to craft the item close to the customer that placed the order.${prompt}
  16590: Apparently, they want to make sure you know what you're doing and also keep an eye on the quality of the finished product. They won't accept items crafted anywhere else, so be sure to keep that in mind.${prompt}
  16591: You'll need to gather the materials necessary to make the requested item. I'll leave how you obtain them up to you.${prompt}
  16592: It's still in the trial phase, but an agreement between the guilds has enabled you to purchase certain products that were previously unavailable.${prompt}
  16593: You can purchase the products from the vendor responsible for selling crafting sets in each guild.${prompt}
  16594: However, each guild has its own set of guidelines. You may not be able to purchase the item you need, but you might get lucky from time to time.${prompt}

  16612: Thank you for your report. You did a good job out there.${prompt}

  16618: Hahaha! It really is a thing of beauty! It brings a smile to my face just looking at it.${prompt}
  16619: According to her calculations, this next upgrade will unleash the shield's untold power. At last, the ultimate shield is within your grasp.${prompt}
  16620: Oh, I almost forgot. I have a new crafting technique to teach you. You've already come so far, I'm sure you'll have no trouble using it.${prompt}
  16621: Ah, there you are. If this procedure is done properly, this shield will possess extraordinary power.${prompt}
  16622: Now then, let us discuss how to obtain the materials you will need.${prompt}
  16623: 'I see you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  16624: Of course, you will need to exchange crafter points like you normally do. If you have enough points, go visit Yek Falimeygo to exchange them.${prompt}
  16625: 'Next, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. The method for obtaining it is the same as before; hand me your shield once its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt}'
  16626: That concludes the explanation. The path that lies before you is clear. I look forward to seeing you reach its destination.${prompt}
  16627: 'Now, you already know about the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, right? I believe Mewk Chorosap is looking for it, so take it to her.${prompt}'
  16628: Ah, it's you again. What can I help you with?${prompt}
  16629: Hmm... You must be referring to the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested that I make.${prompt}
  16630: I apologize, but you are too late. I have already sent it off to Jeuno.${prompt}
  16631: I imagine it has been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now. You will have to go and check for yourself.${prompt}
  16632: 'Ah, you came at just the right time. Look here. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} that I sent to Jeuno was just sitting here on my desk.${prompt}'

  16634: Hmm... Look at this emblem...${prompt}
  16635: So this is what the completed shield looks like... I see the guild emblem I crafted is prominently displayed.${prompt}
  16636: Hahahaha! If this is not perfection, I do not know what is!${prompt}
  16637: This has been most entertaining. While this is not much of a reward, I would like to teach you a new crafting technique. I am certain you will have no problems mastering it.${prompt}

    Different perspectives...
    ${selection-lines}
    Yeah, that makes sense.
    Not necessarily.
    What're you on about?${prompt}
  16709: See? I knew an adventurer such as yourself would understand.${prompt}
  16710: Is that so? I figured an adventurer such as yourself would understand.${prompt}
  16711: Oops. I think I started in the middle of the story. Let's see...${prompt}
  16712: Here's what happened. Cornelia thinks that Galka and Hume should engage in the same type of formal education.${prompt}
  16713: She believes the best way to build bridges between our respective groups is to treat everyone equally from childhood.${prompt}
  16714: It's a lofty goal, I'll admit, but though Galka have never been the type to go to schools as Humes do, we can still do all the things everyone else can. The “three Rs,” if you will.${prompt}
  16715: When our long journey of rebirth ends, we learn everything we need to know from our elders.${prompt}
  16716: And perhaps the biggest part of that is learning what it means to be a Galka.${prompt}
  16717: Gumbah, I don't mean to say that there aren't things that young Galka can best learn from their own.${prompt}
  16718: Cornelia. I assume you were listening in?
  16719: Just from the end. But in the same way, Galka can learn a lot from Humes, as well.${prompt}
  16720: And schools are more than just places for our children to read from dusty old manuscripts and memorize their times tables.${prompt}
  16721: They're places where children can interact with others--both their instructors and fellow students--and create the type of special bond that can only come from shared experiences.${prompt}
  16722: Bonds, huh? You sure that it's not just a place for people to impress their beliefs on others?${prompt}
  16723: No, that's not what I'm saying at all.${prompt}
  16724: It sounds to me like Humes trying to impose their will on the Galka.${prompt}
  16725: Gumbah, I'm not trying to do anything of the kind!${prompt}
  16726: '...Sorry, Cornelia. I shouldn''t have snapped at you. I''ve been having some terrible dreams lately, and my lack of good sleep might have caught up with me.${prompt}'
  16727: And besides, after everything that adventurers have done for our fair city, I wouldn't want to involve one in some petty squabbles. And surely you didn't come here to trade barbs, either.${prompt}
  16728: Of course not. In fact...${prompt}
  16729: I came with a request of sorts. One of the workers in the Zeruhn Mines came to me with the strangest sighting--a Galkan child wandering aimlessly about the place.${prompt}
  16730: I can't help but think that the poor thing might have just been reborn and doesn't know where to go or what to do.${prompt}
  16731: Of all the--the Zeruhn mines? We've got to go get some help from the adults!${prompt}
  16732: I'm really worried. Maybe I'll trek on ahead.${prompt}
  16733: |-
    Cornelia!${wait-36: 1}
    Darn it, I don't think she heard me. I know her heart's in the right place, but those mines are dangerous!${prompt}
  16734: I think we'd better split up. You go after Cornelia while I get some help.${prompt}
  16735: The mines aren't exactly the best place for someone to wander around unprotected.${prompt}
  16736: I'll head over as soon as I can. If what Cornelia heard is true, there's a chance you'll run into this Galka before her--so if you do, make sure he's safe, okay?${prompt}
  16737: Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, would you mind going after Cornelia?${prompt}
  16738: She's probably gone to the Zeruhn mines all on her lonesome.${prompt}
  16739: I'll head over as soon as I can. If what she heard is true, there's a chance you'll run into the newly reborn Galka before Cornelia--so if you do, make sure he's safe, okay?${prompt}
  16740: Ah, well look who it is. You must be concerned about the Galkan child too.${prompt}
  16741: Of course. I should have known Gumbah would worry about me.${prompt}
  16742: Between him and the foremen, everyone I've talked to today is too concerned for my well-being. They won't even let me further into the mines.${prompt}
  16743: It doesn't make any sense. If they're that insistent on looking after me, then why wouldn't they be twice as interested in the young one wandering around unaccompanied?${prompt}
  16744: When I pointed that out, Rasmus said, “Oh, right. We did see him further in...”${prompt}
  16745: I know! They might not let me proceed, but surely they'd have no such qualms about you!${prompt}
  16746: Maybe some of the other foremen would know more. Could you ask them about the Galkan child and go looking for him?${prompt}
  16747: I'll be waiting for Gumbah to join up. Best of luck.${prompt}
  16748: Cornelia is waiting for me in the Zeruhn Mines?${prompt}
  16749: Then I guess I should go get my things together and head over to meet her. I promise to be quick.${prompt}
  16750: What!? There actually was a Galkan child in Zeruhn!?${prompt}
  16751: I'll get some Galkan adults and rush over there with them! You have to protect the child until we get there!${prompt}
  16752: Thanks again, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer. Without you, who knows what that Goblin would have done to him--to Raebrimm.${prompt}
  16753: He's been through a lot, and is resting here in the city. He was scuffed up a little, but we expect him to make a swift, safe recovery.${prompt}
  16754: Still, don't you think it's a little out of character, even for a Goblin, to attack a child? What's that all about?${prompt}
  16755: Ah, Cornelia! Were you able to learn anything?${prompt}
  16756: I'm afraid I've turned up nothing.${prompt}
  16757: I asked the Mythril Musketeers for help, and even though they gladly agreed to look into things, it might take a while before they find out anything concrete.${prompt}
  16758: I guess it can't be helped, but it's still pretty frustrating. The Goblin might come after Raebrimm again, and we've got to be prepared.${prompt}
  16759: I agree, and came up with a plan. What if we were to disguise Raebrimm?${prompt}
  16760: Disguise him?${prompt}
  16761: Yeah. You know, a little wig here, a little makeup there, and no one will be able to tell that it's him!${prompt}
  16762: And if there's anyone who's an expert in making disguises to avoid attention, it's me.${prompt}
  16763: Avoid attention? You? The guards have seen through your tricks so many times that I've started to keep a running tally.${prompt}
  16764: Uh, well, be that as it may...${prompt}
  16765: Failure is the first step to success, right? And I know just the fashionista to help us pull this off.${prompt}
  16766: How do you know a fashionista!?${prompt}
  16767: Why, everyone knows Brygid. And I think she owes me a favor.${prompt}
  16768: You know how much she values her reputation. If anyone can help us disguise Raebrimm, it's her.${prompt}
  16769: Why do I have a bad feeling about this?${prompt}
  16770: I wouldn't say I have a “bad feeling,” but there is one small hurdle to climb. She says that she's looking for new entrants in a show that's going to start soon and doesn't have much time to spare for us.${prompt}
  16771: And that's where you come in!${prompt}
  16772: If you can help Brygid with her show, then she'll absolutely have to assist us! C'mon!${prompt}
  16773: |-
    Cornelia! Corn--${wait-36: 1}
    Darn it, she ran off again. Leave it to her to just assume we'll follow this plan to the letter.${prompt}
  16774: But I guess we don't have any choice now, do we? I know it's an odd request, but think of it as helping to protect an innocent child. Let's go find Brygid.${prompt}
  16775: I know that Cornelia's plan may sound a bit half-baked, but I can't come up with anything better. Let's go find Brygid.${prompt}
  16776: ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, you remember our friend Raebrimm, right? The Galkan child in the unforgettable Goblin getup?${prompt}
  16777: |-
    Do you remember Raebrimm?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Who's that, again?${prompt}
  16778: Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that your mind is sound.${prompt}
  16779: How could you forget? After all, you were the one who went to the Zeruhn Mines and saved him from a vicious assault.${prompt}
  16780: I've got some news on the black-clad Goblin that was threatening him.${prompt}
  16781: Evidently we've been able to learn about where the menace was headed next.${prompt}
  16782: Cornelia asked the Mythril Musketeers for their help in tracking the beastman down--and I'm pleased to report that they agreed to aid us.${prompt}
  16783: Gumbah, I'm back!
  16784: Oh, and look who's with you!${prompt}
  16785: ${name-player}, your timing is impeccable, as always. I wanted to share this with the both of you.${prompt}
  16786: Iron Eater, if you would.${prompt}
  16787: <Sigh> How could I say no to that face?${prompt}
  16788: We Mythril Musketeers have worked tirelessly to gather information on your little Goblin problem. While we haven't identified who exactly that little beastie is...${prompt}
  16789: We do know that a strange Goblin was seen flitting about the markets, darting from shadow to shadow in an attempt to avoid detection.${prompt}
  16790: I would imagine that a Goblin dressed in black from head to toe would arouse some amount of suspicion.${prompt}
  16791: Aye, and surely we would have heard more reports if the beast moved via ordinary means...but his modes of transportation are a bit more arcane, which would explain why he is able to mostly avoid detection in his search for Raebrimm.${prompt}
  16792: The good news is that Brygid's disguise seems to be working, because Raebrimm remains unharmed.${prompt}
  16793: In fact, that's why we have any information at all--the Goblin must be getting desperate and resorting to more overt means of tracking his quarry, and just now we got word that someone matching his description was spotted in Korroloka Tunnel.${prompt}
  16794: That's great news!${prompt}
  16795: Is it really? I mean, we haven't exactly stopped his advance.${prompt}
  16796: Fear not--we have no intention of letting him walk. In fact, I ordered Naji to go after him posthaste.${prompt}
  16797: And by “we,” I mean the Mythril Musketeers. Miss Cornelia, you are to remain within the city walls.${prompt}
  16798: You're going to let Naji take the lead AND make me stay here!?${prompt}
  16799: No way. I've got to see this through to its conclusion.${prompt}
  16800: While I share your distaste at letting Naji run point...${prompt}
  16801: He is a Mythril Musketeer, unreliable though he may be.${prompt}
  16802: Still, I agree that it couldn't hurt to send backup of some sort. Adventurer, I'd wager you're more than willing to volunteer.${prompt}
  16803: What a splendid idea!${prompt}
  16804: Most assuredly. We've got to let Raebrimm know that we will do anything to ensure his safety.${prompt}
  16805: We're counting on you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  16806: I know it's only Korroloka Tunnel, but Naji is definitely going to be in over his head.${prompt}
  16807: Would you mind heading over? Not for my sake, but for Raebrimm's.${prompt}
  16808: Raebrimm filled us in on what happened. You have my sincere thanks.${prompt}
  16809: But “Gloom Phantom,” eh? What a straightforward moniker.${prompt}
  16810: And the three of them call themselves “The Destiny Destroyers.” Well, at least their naming sense is on point.${prompt}
  16811: I've known beastmen to be a bit odd, but an egg hunt? Something tells me they don't simply want initial eggs.${prompt}
  16812: ${name-player}! I heard that everything went well.${prompt}
  16813: You're just the person I wanted to see, too. There's something I don't quite understand.${prompt}
  16814: Cornelia? Did something happen?${prompt}
  16815: Well, it's about Naji...${prompt}
  16816: He hasn't returned to file his report, and it's well past time for him to make his way back the city.${prompt}

  16819: While his desire to get to the heart of the matter is commendable, that doesn't change the fact that he left the Galkan child behind.${prompt}
  16820: Nor did he send word back of his intentions.${prompt}
  16821: I hope everything's okay. What if he was hurt? Or captured?${prompt}
  16822: No, others have already reported seeing him back in the city with no apparent injuries.${prompt}
  16823: Until he reports in, I suppose I'll have to ask you, Gumbah, to get the full story from Raebrimm.${prompt}
  16824: Hmmm... Although I did order Naji to track down the source of the problem, he may have gotten in over his head.${prompt}
  16825: But the most critical mission--ensuring Raebrimm's safety--appears to have been a rousing success. You have my thanks.${prompt}
  16826: We couldn't have done it without you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  16827: Gumbah, I'd like to hear what happened directly from Raebrimm's mouth. Perhaps we might glean some deeper insight into this matter.${prompt}
  16828: Leave it to Naji to go traipsing off without backup.${prompt}
  16829: According to Raebrimm, the Goblin succeeded in...whatever it was that they were trying to do.${prompt}
  16830: As long as they'll leave him alone, though, does it really matter whether or not they're brought into custody?${prompt}
  16831: That may very well be, but I'm afraid we're left with more questions than answers. I'd like to talk to Raebrimm myself.${prompt}
  16832: Of course. I'll get him right away.${prompt}
  16833: ${name-player}, there's something that's been bothering me.${prompt}

  16840: I suppose you'd rather not talk about it.${prompt}
  16841: Maybe you think I'm just some girl in over my head, like everyone else...${prompt}
  16842: Cornelia, the conclusion we came to is that the Goblin wasn't after the eggshell itself, but rather a whole egg.${prompt}
  16843: They were trailing Raebrimm because they caught the scent of it, but what they found was just a “shell” of what they thought it would be.${prompt}
  16844: That's the lamest pun I've ever heard.${prompt}

    What happens if we don't mesh?${prompt}
  16971: Perhaps consider starting with a simple greeting. Something like...${prompt}
  16972: “Hello, everyone. My name's ${name-player}. Nice to meet you!”${prompt}

  17054: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  17055: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  17056: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}

  17065: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}

  17067: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  17068: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  17069: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}

  17102: 'Hey, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]! You must help us! Raebrimm is gone!${prompt}'
  17103: He said he was going to search for the mountain he saw in his dream, and was studying up on Galkan history.${prompt}
  17104: Apparently, he thinks it's the mountain that we Galka climb as part of our journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  17105: You see, once we reach a certain age, we can sense when death will come for us.${prompt}
  17106: |-
    So when that time comes, we set out on a journey to be reborn.
    It's almost as if we're guided to our destination by some unseen force.${prompt}
  17107: |-
    At the end of the journey, they say we eventually arrive at a mountain.
    And once we climb it, our old body is replaced with that of a child...${prompt}
  17108: Eventually, we descend from the mountaintop and suddenly find ourselves surrounded by other people.${prompt}
  17109: I'm certain that Raebrimm arrived here in Bastok via the Korroloka Tunnel after his rebirth.${prompt}
  17110: Therefore, I think he might've tried retracing his steps in order to reach the Galkan homeland of Zepwell Island...${prompt}
  17111: Gumbah! It appears you were right about Raebrimm!${prompt}
  17112: Oh, ${name-player}! I'm glad you're here!${prompt}
  17113: |-
    Did Gumbah already tell you about Raebrimm?
    He just left without saying a word to anyone!${prompt}
  17114: Cornelia! Have you heard any news regarding Raebrimm!?${prompt}
  17115: You were right... It appears he set out for Zepwell Island!${prompt}
  17116: A merchant who just arrived from the island said that he passed a Galkan child in the Korroloka Tunnel.${prompt}
  17117: I knew it...${prompt}
  17118: I wonder if he finally managed to remember whatever was bothering him...${prompt}
  17119: And while I might just be overthinking things, I heard something else that was interesting.${prompt}
  17120: There is a Tarutaru researcher from Windurst currently visiting Rabao on Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  17121: |-
    Recently, that researcher caused quite the commotion.
    I guess he spotted a fugitive from Windurst near the Quicksand Caves.${prompt}
  17122: He was telling an adventurer with him that this person was definitely the one they were looking for due to the mysterious orb he was carrying.${prompt}
  17123: |-
    You remember, don't you, ${name-player}?
    The deadly scorpion that arose due to the power of the “World Eater Egg”?${prompt}
  17124: Afterwards, we received a reply from Windurst stating that the mage Uran-Mafran stole the scorpion's power!${prompt}
  17125: That mage is usually up to no good, so the country is putting all its resources into investigating the matter.${prompt}
  17126: Windurst also knows how dangerous this “World Eater Egg” is, so it didn't take much to convince them.${prompt}
  17127: However, not much is known about Uran-Mafran, so his origins are shrouded in mystery.${prompt}
  17128: They told me they'd get back to me later with more details, but they may just be hiding the truth...${prompt}
  17129: |-
    At any rate, there doesn't appear to be any information regarding Uran-Mafran in Windurst.
    As such, he might not be from there.${prompt}
  17130: Although, Iron Eater said that we shouldn't take them at their word on that matter, since they may know more than they're telling us.${prompt}
  17131: Therefore, all of this has me very interested in this fugitive spotted near the Quicksand Caves.${prompt}
  17132: Hmm... So you're saying there's a dangerous fugitive somewhere on Zepwell Island?${prompt}
  17133: Yes, it appears so.${prompt}
  17134: I'm thinking I should leave this to our friend ${name-player} here...${prompt}
  17135: Can you please go to Zepwell Island and see if Raebrimm is safe or not?${prompt}
  17136: Yes, I feel the same way... And if you find him, can you please tell him how worried we are?${prompt}
  17137: First off, you should probably speak with Dancing Wolf, a soldier who has been dispatched to Rabao.${prompt}
  17138: I hear that he's been tasked with gathering information in the area.${prompt}
  17139: As such, he might know something, maybe even about Uran-Mafran...${prompt}
  17140: |-
    Please hurry. I'm very worried about Raebrimm.
    I wish I could go with you...${prompt}
  17141: |-
    No, it's not safe for you, Gumbah.
    Please don't make me worry even more than I already am.${prompt}
  17142: Hmm... Maybe I should tell someone about this...${prompt}
  17143: |-
    I'm worried about Raebrimm.
    Please hurry to Zepwell Island and make sure he's okay.${prompt}
  17144: Cornelia said that the soldier known as Dancing Wolf might know something.${prompt}
  17145: |-
    That's wonderful!
    I'm so glad to hear that Raebrimm is safe.${prompt}
  17146: |-
    I wonder if he'll be coming home anytime soon...
    He needs to know just how angry everyone is with him for leaving without telling anyone.${prompt}
  17147: |-
    Please keep Raebrimm safe until he returns home.
    I'm counting on you, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]!${prompt}
  17148: |-
    I can't believe Raebrimm went all the way to Zepwell Island.
    At least he's safe, though.${prompt}
  17149: |-
    I must see him at once!
    Wait for me, Raebrimm! I'm coming for you!${prompt}
  17150: <Sigh> I've got a bad feeling about this...${prompt}
  17151: 'You must help Raebrimm, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]!${prompt}'
  17152: 'Welcome back, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister].${prompt}'
  17153: |-
    Ah, you've returned at last.
    I heard all about what happened in the Quicksand Caves on Zepwell Island.${prompt}
  17154: I never expected that Uran-Mafran's scheming would threaten the very existence of us Galka...${prompt}
  17155: Master Oggbi has given permission to send a letter to the various Galkan elders, informing them of the news.${prompt}
  17156: However, we don't intend on telling them everything we know since normally, Galka don't remember their rebirth, myself included.${prompt}
  17157: |-
    In fact, there is still much I don't know...
    I find it all hard to believe, and I'm still in a state of shock.${prompt}
  17158: If the Talekeeper were here now, I wonder what he would say...${prompt}
  17159: Maybe that we should remain calm and gather the facts?${prompt}
  17160: Yes, I suppose you're right. Well said, Gumbah.${prompt}
  17161: Thanks!${prompt}
  17162: Gumbah, I would like to ask your opinion as the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  17163: I knew it. I knew you were the Talekeeper, Gumbah!${prompt}
  17164: I know, but it's nothing really. All I do is carry on the memories of my people.${prompt}
  17165: Right now, the only thing I can say is that we should try to gather all of the facts first.${prompt}
  17166: As such, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter too, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17167: Yes, I suppose there is still much to be learned.${prompt}
  17168: |-
    First, there is the war being waged in Valhalla.
    How should we describe Valhalla itself?${prompt}
  17169: |-
    How would you describe Valhalla?
    ${selection-lines}
    It is a world where souls gather to battle.
    It is a world ruled by Odin.
    It is a dazzling dream world.${prompt}
  17170: Yes, you're right. It is a world ruled by Odin where powerful souls are brought together.${prompt}
  17171: Are you sure about that? I think it's better described as a world ruled by Odin where powerful souls are brought together.${prompt}
  17172: |-
    However, we Galka are allowed to enter it for some reason.
    Do you know why?${prompt}
  17173: |-
    Do you know the reason?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I do.
    No, not really.${prompt}
  17174: Yes, the Destiny Destroyers did mention something about a powerful Galka who lived five thousand years ago.${prompt}
  17175: Apparently, his strength even impressed Odin himself, which earned the Galka such special treatment.${prompt}
  17176: However, we don't know anything else about this Galka...${prompt}
  17177: Five thousand years ago...${prompt}
  17178: |-
    In other words, there was some kind of connection between Odin and the Galka a long time ago.
    That is quite surprising.${prompt}
  17179: So for five thousand years, the Galka have been reborn by visiting Valhalla.${prompt}
  17180: However, there is currently a war being fought in Valhalla.${prompt}
  17181: Uran-Mafran's master, Garazu-Horeizu the Maelstrom Mage, has risen in rebellion against Odin, the god who leads the dead.${prompt}
  17182: Garazu-Horeizu has rallied many to his cause, and also possesses the ability to send them to this world as well.${prompt}
  17183: |-
    His ultimate goal is to be resurrected in this world.
    Although, I don't imagine that is an easy task to perform?${prompt}
  17184: '${choice: 0}[No,/Probably not,] but I believe that the Galka are reborn through the power of Odin.${prompt}'
  17185: I suppose it's the power contained within life itself and also crystals that Uran-Mafran was talking about?${prompt}
  17186: Uran-Mafran apparently gathered that power within his orb.${prompt}
  17187: Yes, he also stole the power of the scorpion that had obtained the power of the “World Eater Egg” before.${prompt}
  17188: Which means, the power of the World Eater Egg is based on the power of the crystals?${prompt}
  17189: Hey, just what kind of egg is this World Eater Egg, anyway?${prompt}
  17190: I know I had the eggshell while I was in Valhalla, but I don't really remember much about it.${prompt}
  17191: Do you know anything, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  17192: |-
    What do you know about the egg?
    ${selection-lines}
    It's Chaos's egg.
    It's Caboose's egg.
    I don't know anything.${prompt}
  17193: Chaos? Where have I heard that name before?${prompt}
  17194: |-
    There's new information about the “World Eater Egg”!?
    You must tell us at once, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  17195: Caboose? That name sounds familiar...${prompt}
  17196: |-
    Please calm down and try to remember, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister].
    This is important.${prompt}
  17197: I thought you had heard something from the Destiny Destroyers, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  17198: |-
    Please, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]... Try to remember.
    This is important.${prompt}
  17199: I'm not sure if we can take what the Goblin said at face value...${prompt}
  17200: I've never heard about beastmen working together to take down a powerful enemy known as Chaos.${prompt}
  17201: If it took place five thousand years ago, I don't think it's all that strange that we haven't heard anything about it.${prompt}
  17202: Furthermore, I find it interesting that the story about Odin and that Galka also took place five thousand years ago.${prompt}
  17203: Are you saying it's no coincidence?${prompt}
  17204: Indeed. Of course, it's just a hunch.${prompt}
  17205: |-
    Okay then, let's assume this is all true.
    That would mean that this Goblin hero finished off Chaos back then.${prompt}
  17206: |-
    However, World Eater Eggs are being found all over the world.
    Raebrimm also acquired an eggshell while in Valhalla.${prompt}
  17207: In other words, there was also a “World Eater Egg” in Valhalla, and it was broken open?${prompt}
  17208: “When the World Eater Egg is awakened, the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...”${prompt}
  17209: I wonder if the “World Eater Egg” within Valhalla being broken open was what caused that message to be given to Raebrimm.${prompt}
  17210: But something was growing inside of that egg, right?${prompt}
  17211: Raebrimm! Gumbah! Good, everyone's all here!
  17212: I'm glad you're safe! I was really worried about you!${prompt}
  17213: Cornelia... I'm sorry if I made you worry.${prompt}
  17214: We had both our adventurer friend here and Oggbi with us, so we were in good hands.${prompt}
  17215: Hmph! Aren't you going to apologize too, Gumbah!?${prompt}
  17216: Ahem... My lady, we were trying to go over some rather important topics...${prompt}
  17217: 'Ah, yes... ${choice: 0}[Father/Volker] told me everything.${prompt}'
  17218: He mentioned that this is strongly connected to the Galka's process of rebirth, and that we therefore shouldn't meddle too much.${prompt}
  17219: |-
    However, at least let me say one thing!
    If there is anything us Humes can do, please don't hesitate to ask!${prompt}
  17220: Gumbah and Raebrimm are both important friends of mine.${prompt}
  17221: And you're not embarrassed to say so, Cornelia?${prompt}
  17222: There you go again...${prompt}
  17223: My lady, I appreciate your concern, but it is still too early for us to make any kind of move.${prompt}
  17224: All we know so far is the location of Uran-Mafran and his master, Garazu-Horeizu, as well as their overall plan...${prompt}
  17225: Thanks to ${name-player} and Oggbi here, that plan has been temporarily thwarted, but I'm sure it will resume before too long.${prompt}
  17226: Therefore, we are trying to devise a response for when it does.${prompt}
  17227: I have yet to come up with any good ideas, but I think we should collect what we do know and report it to the president.${prompt}
  17228: I understand.${prompt}
  17229: Actually, ${name-player}... I have an urgent matter to discuss with you.${prompt}
  17230: |-
    We've received word from Doctor Shantotto in Windurst.
    She wants you to meet with her as soon as possible.${prompt}
  17231: Judging by the way she was speaking, it sounds like she's been keeping an eye on you somehow.${prompt}
  17232: She said to stop wasting time with Gumbah and to go see her at once.${prompt}
  17233: Those were her words, not mine.${prompt}
  17234: 'Therefore, I ${choice: 0}[asked my father/pulled some strings] to get you this special gift.${prompt}'
  17235: ${name-player}, thank you for finding Raebrimm and keeping him safe for us.${prompt}
  17236: Yeah, thank you.
  17237: You were a big help.
  17238: |-
    You should hurry to Windurst, ${name-player}.
    We could definitely use the wisdom of their scholars in this matter.${prompt}
  17239: You may be able to ask for their insight regarding Uran-Mafran and his master, Garazu-Horeizu, as well as the World Eater Egg.${prompt}
  17240: Although, I do ask that you refrain from mentioning anything about the process of our rebirth.${prompt}
  17241: |-
    Will you keep their secret?
    ${selection-lines}
    I understand.
    I'm not sure if that's possible...${prompt}
  17242: |-
    The very future of the Galka depends on this matter.
    Please keep that in mind when discussing it.${prompt}
  17243: Yes, I imagine it is always possible that you could be interrogated about what you know.${prompt}
  17244: What!?
  17245: |-
    Like I said, please try to refrain from saying anything.
    However, I will understand if you're left with no other choice.${prompt}
  17246: |-
    See you later, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister].
    We'll be sure to let you know if we find out anything new.${prompt}
  17247: Raebrimm might just remember something. Also...${prompt}
  17248: The day may come when my soul is summoned...${prompt}
  17249: Wait a moment! Don't forget the gift that Cornelia brought you!${prompt}
  17250: 'You''re heading to Windurst, right, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]?${prompt}'
  17251: |-
    We Galka have much to talk about.
    Who knows, we might even remember something new.${prompt}
  17252: The future of the Galka is riding on this, so we all must move quickly...${prompt}
  17253: |-
    Oh, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
    How have you been?${prompt}
  17254: We've been looking into various things since we last met, but we won't understand most of it until we can speak with Odin directly.${prompt}
  17255: However, one thing that we do know is that the Galka had to join the battle within Valhalla.${prompt}
  17256: The current Talekeeper had to lead a strong group of Galkan warriors through the gates of the underworld.${prompt}
  17257: But although Raebrimm was asked to do so by Odin, he has forgotten pretty much everything.${prompt}
  17258: |-
    Ultimately, the Galka were saved though.
    I can't imagine what Raebrimm is feeling.${prompt}
  17259: |-
    He has looked rather gloomy lately.
    I'm worried about him...${prompt}
  17260: |-
    Hey, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister].
    I think you'll want to hear this.${prompt}
  17261: Raebrimm has been confined to his bed...${prompt}
  17262: According to him, he was only born in order to convey Odin's message.${prompt}
  17263: Since he has completed that task, he thinks he'll have to return to Valhalla now.${prompt}
  17264: Does that mean he's going to die?${prompt}
  17265: I thought you had to be strong to earn the right to go to Valhalla!${prompt}
  17266: Besides, the gate to the underworld is currently closed.${prompt}
  17267: |-
    Although, I hear there's another gate to the north.
    It might still be open...${prompt}
  17268: |-
    You see, I've been having dreams about it recently.
    Or maybe it's more accurate to say I'm being shown visions of it.${prompt}
  17269: Could this be what they mean when they say that Odin comes calling for your soul?${prompt}
  17270: |-
    Oh, that reminds me.
    Do you know anything about this, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]?${prompt}
  17271: There are rumors of a beastman dwelling known as Movalpolos somewhere in North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  17272: Apparently, these beastmen resemble Goblins and are known as Moblins...${prompt}
  17273: I hear that a lone Galka has gone there to live among them.${prompt}
  17274: We need to inform that Galka that the gates to the underworld have been closed.${prompt}
  17275: |-
    Iron Eater and Oggbi are currently busy dealing with other matters.
    Can I ask for your help with this, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]?${prompt}
  17276: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, no problem.
    Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt}
  17277: |-
    Ah, I guess it can't be helped then.
    Please let me know if you can find some time.${prompt}
  17278: |-
    That's a relief.
    There's much that we don't know about these Moblins in Movalpolos, so be careful out there.${prompt}
  17279: There's apparently a Galka living among the Moblins in Movalpolos.${prompt}
  17280: I'd like you to inform this Galka that the gates to the underworld have been closed.${prompt}
  17281: I find it hard to concentrate on such things while worrying about Raebrimm.${prompt}
  17282: Perhaps Odin is calling for his soul?${prompt}
  17283: |-
    Hey, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]...
    Is Raebrimm...${prompt}
  17284: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    He's dead.
    He's no longer with us.
    You won't be seeing him anymore.${prompt}
  17285: '!!!'
  17286: N-no, it can't be!
  17287: <Gasp>!
  17288: |-
    What happened to him?
    You must tell me everything.${prompt}
  17289: |-
    I see...
    So after he helped you, he...${prompt}
  17290: Somehow, I had a feeling that Raebrimm and Raogrimm were connected in such a way.${prompt}
  17291: |-
    So Raebrimm was the reincarnated form of Raogrimm...
    That must be why he felt so familiar.${prompt}
  17292: However, that was no ordinary reincarnation.${prompt}
  17293: I wish I could go back to the time when Raebrimm didn't remember anything.${prompt}
  17294: We could have gone on so many journeys together!${prompt}
  17295: If only I could share a nice, hearty laugh with him again.${prompt}
  17296: I mean, even though he only had half of a soul, he was no different from the rest of us...${prompt}
  17297: |-
    Sorry, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]...
    I know this is no time to be crying.${prompt}
  17298: Thank you for sharing Raebrimm's story with me.${prompt}
  17299: So the Galka who had a deep connection to Odin was actually the original Talekeeper.${prompt}
  17300: |-
    Although, I am surprised to hear that Odin bequeathed his left eye to the Talekeeper.
    That means that its power also resides within me as well.${prompt}
  17301: |-
    Although, I am surprised to hear that Odin bequeathed his left eye to the Talekeeper.
    That means that its power also resides within the Talekeeper's soul as well.${prompt}
  17302: If I return that power to Odin, will he be able to defeat Chaos?${prompt}
  17303: |-
    Can Odin defeat Chaos?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.
    I don't know.${prompt}
  17304: |-
    In that case, I will give it back to him.
    Although the Talekeeper will lose his ability, the Galka can continue to hand down our stories on his behalf.${prompt}
  17305: |-
    In that case, I am certain the Talekeeper will return the power without hesitation.
    The Galka can simply continue to hand down our stories on his behalf.${prompt}
  17306: |-
    I shall close my eyes and make a wish to the Talekeeper.
    If I do, I am certain that it will come true.${prompt}
  17307: |-
    You're right--nobody can predict the future.
    That is why we must look to the past instead.${prompt}
  17308: |-
    History tells us that five thousand years ago, Odin emerged triumphant.
    That is why I must return his eye.${prompt}
  17309: History tells us that five thousand years ago, Odin emerged triumphant.${prompt}
  17310: Therefore, I am certain that the Talekeeper will return his eye to him.${prompt}
  17311: |-
    I shall close my eyes and make a wish to the Talekeeper.
    If I do, I am certain that it will come true.${prompt}
  17312: Huh!? What's that?
  17313: So this is Odin's eye...${prompt}
  17314: |-
    Does this mean my wish was granted?
    Is this Odin's eye...?${prompt}
  17315: Ah!
  17316: |-
    This is the way it should be.
    Raebrimm's wish has been granted.${prompt}
  17317: What was that?${prompt}
  17318: Gumbah, a ball of light rose up from your house and disappeared!${prompt}
  17319: It was an important source of power that is finally being returned to Odin.${prompt}
  17320: |-
    An important source of power?
    Does it have anything to do with Raebrimm?${prompt}
  17321: What do you mean?
  17322: |-
    Well, you see...
    I had a bit too much to drink and fell asleep.${prompt}
  17323: |-
    However, it caused me to have the most vivid dream.
    Raebrimm appeared before me to thank me and say farewell.${prompt}
  17324: What's more, he was holding hands with Cornelia...${prompt}
  17325: |-
    <Sniffle>...
    Oggbi, Raebrimm came from Raogrimm and he...${prompt}
  17326: |-
    I see...
    I was hoping that my premonition would not ring true...${prompt}
  17327: We must simply think of him as Raebrimm when we mourn him.${prompt}
  17328: ${name-player}, did Raebrimm leave anything behind?${prompt}
  17329: What is that?${prompt}
  17330: |-
    I recognize this!
    It did not belong to Raebrimm, but rather my disciple Cornelia!${prompt}
  17331: You mean the Cornelia who journeyed north with Raogrimm so long ago?${prompt}
  17332: |-
    That is correct.
    If Cornelia left this behind, it must mean that she thought it could be useful.${prompt}
  17333: |-
    ${name-player}, I am sure she meant for you to have this.
    Please look after it, will you?${prompt}
  17334: 'Yes, much like Raebrimm protected you, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister], I imagine Cornelia wished to do so as well.${prompt}'
  17335: Besides, the memories that Raebrimm left us with are more than enough.${prompt}
  17336: |-
    You are right.
    We should share this news with Raebrimm's friends as well.${prompt}
  17337: |-
    Please, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]...
    Don't ever forget Raebrimm.${prompt}
  17338: '${lettercase: 1}${choice: 6}[mister/lady], please take good care of the item that Raebrimm and Cornelia entrusted you with.${prompt}'
  17339: That way, you can think of Raebrimm whenever you look at it.${prompt}
  17340: |-
    I wish I could've spoken with Raebrimm again.
    I wonder if I'll see him in my dreams...${prompt}
  17341: |-
    No, I am being selfish--he deserves his rest.
    I'm certain we'll meet again when he's ready.${prompt}
  17342: |-
    I heard the news!
    Finally, after five thousand years, Chaos has been defeated!${prompt}
  17343: |-
    Huh?
    How do I know that, you ask?${prompt}
  17344: Odin came to me in a dream.${prompt}
  17345: He once again bequeathed the power of his eye to the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  17346: That power is the source of the Talekeeper's ability to carry on the memories of his people.${prompt}
  17347: |-
    While he was speaking to me, I was flooded with various images.
    Or maybe they were more like visions?${prompt}
  17348: He once again bequeathed to me the power of his eye.${prompt}
  17349: That power is the source of my ability to carry on the memories of our people.${prompt}
  17350: |-
    Suddenly, I found myself flooded with various images.
    Or maybe they were more like visions?${prompt}
  17351: Although, I don't feel there is any need for the memories of the Galka to be passed down anymore.${prompt}
  17352: When I mentioned it to Odin, he told me why he gave the Talekeeper his power once again.${prompt}
  17353: He plans to use the power to keep watch over Vana'diel.${prompt}
  17354: It seems that it's important to monitor the movements of his nemesis, Alexander.${prompt}
  17355: If he doesn't, Vana'diel may find itself engulfed in the flames of war once again.${prompt}
  17356: |-
    I find this all so tiring.
    I wish we could finally live a life without fear!${prompt}
  17357: Although, at least we don't have to worry about our rebirth now since the gate to the underworld at Zepwell Island is secure.${prompt}
  17358: Oh! I almost forgot!${prompt}
  17359: We held a funeral ceremony for Raebrimm.${prompt}
  17360: 'I''m sorry we couldn''t wait for you, ${choice: 1}[miss/mister]...${prompt}'
  17361: However, at least now, Raebrimm can rest in peace.${prompt}
  17362: |-
    If you think about it, it'd be nice for you to offer up a prayer for him from time to time.
    I will be sure to do so too, of course.${prompt}
  17363: |-
    Thanks again for all of your help.
    Even if they don't say it, everyone here is grateful for what you did.${prompt}
  17364: |-
    Thanks to your efforts, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister], we Galka no longer have to worry about our journey of rebirth.
    I'm so relieved!${prompt}
