The hunt registry is a tome through which seasoned adventurers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to A.M.A.N. activities.${prompt};
The hunt registry is a tome through which veteran soldiers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to S.M.A.N. activities.${prompt};
Assignments, or â€œhunts,â€ can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.${prompt};
Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference.;
As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.${prompt};
Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training.;
For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.${prompt};
Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.${prompt};
Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry.;
Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as â€œscyldsâ€--tokens of your valor.${prompt};
More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments.;
Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.${prompt};
Lastly, please note that a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all hunters following the completion of a hunt. Until this time has elapsed, you will not be permitted to undertake another hunt.${prompt};
You record your hunt.;
${color-alt: 121}You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!;

Are you certain?;

No.${prompt};
Hunt canceled.${prompt};
You currently possess ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[scyld/scylds].${prompt};

You want to make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.${prompt};
Such a container can be synthesized if you have two ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
And if my memory serves me true, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} serves as the bonding agentaru.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, I hear, can be had within the Maze of Shakhrami. Not lying scattered about the floors, obviously.;
One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.${prompt};
Oh, did I mention ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
Naturally, to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you'll be needing one of those, too.${prompt};
You wish to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe!;
Its creation requires a few ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
In turn, making ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} requires ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Toss ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.${prompt};
I fear we haven't ${item-plural: 0[2]} here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.${prompt};
What brings you here? Well, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, of all things...;
You couldn't hope to make one without some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.${prompt};
But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way.;
Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some ${item-plural: 0[2]}. That's the main ingredient required to make ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
All that remains, then, is to bind it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} using ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Good luck!${prompt};
You... Yes, the description fits.;
I daresay, you're the one â€œsheâ€ sent, yes?${prompt};
Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?${prompt};
At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.${prompt};
Do as he says?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.;
Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.${prompt};
You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will turn ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.${prompt};
I'm currently investigating the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Hm? It appears you are overburdened.;
Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.${prompt};
That is most disappointing...;
â€œSheâ€ would not be pleased to hear of this.${prompt};
Ah, yes...${prompt};
A truly menacing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one each of the ${entity: 1} and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Do you require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}?;
I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Buy for 800 gil? (You have ${number: 3});
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee.;
I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.${prompt};
It appears you haven't enough gil.${prompt};
Ah, a positively imposing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one of the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
I've eagerly awaited your return.;
With this image of the ${entity: 0}, I hold your task fulfilled.${prompt};
As promised, I relinquish this to you.;
Should another be required, you shall find me here.${prompt};
I need images of the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me images of the ${entity: 0} and the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me an image of the ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.${prompt};
I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.${prompt};
Is there something else you wish of me?;
You already have what you came for, no?${prompt};
We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.${prompt};
Putting up a fight, eh?;
Gorattz! Bompupu! Show ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] what the Tenshodo thinks of meddlesome adventurers!${prompt};

Waaah! I didn't signy-wign up for this...${prompt};

We warmly welcome you to the place of your unmaking.${prompt};

We will make you beg to die!;
Six fulms under you will lie!${prompt};
Naughty children shall receive no quarter!;
Curl up and die, this is your empress's order!${prompt};
You've long overstayed your welcome!;
The punishment will be brutal and gruesome!${prompt};
Which way do you like it--slow or fast?;
Should you lose a limb, be not aghast!${prompt};
You'll wish you were never born!;
From your torso limbs will be torn!${prompt};
Steel yourself for a wicked fright!${prompt};
We shall set your pants alight!${prompt};
The world shall bow before our might!${prompt};
H-how could this be?;
This outcome, we did not foresee...${prompt};
Be this a dream? Or is it real?;
This ending falls sorely short of ideal...${prompt};

It all began with a stone, or so the legend says.${prompt};La légende raconte que tout commença avec une pierre.${prompt}
In ages past, a sentient jewel, enormous and beautiful, banished the darkness. Its many-colored light filled the world with life and brought forth mighty gods.${prompt};En des temps reculés, un immense joyau étincelant bannit les ténèbres. Sa lumière multicolore apporta la vie sur terre et donna naissance à de puissants dieux.${prompt}
Bathed in that light, the world entered an age of bliss until, after a time, the gods fell into slumber. That world was called Vana'diel.${prompt};Baigné dans sa clarté, le monde entra dans un âge béni, et les dieux finirent par tomber dans un sommeil paisible. Ce monde s'appelait Vana'diel.${prompt}
The legend goes on to say...;La légende continue ainsi…
From the darkest depths of the earth the Warriors of the Crystal rose...${prompt};Des profondeurs les plus obscures émergèrent les Guerriers du Cristal…${prompt}
Do you remember?${prompt};Vous vous souvenez?${prompt}
Yes... I do now.${prompt};Oui… Je m'en souviens maintenant.${prompt}
Raogrimm, it is good to have you back. How has all this come to be?${prompt};Raogrimm, c'est bon de vous retrouver. Comment tout cela est-il arrivé ? ${prompt}
As you know, I was the Talekeeper of the Galka--the keeper of our race's memories. But there was so much pain, so much anger...${prompt};Comme vous le savez, j'étais le conteur des Galka, le gardien des souvenirs de notre race. Mais il y avait tant de douleur, tant de colère...${prompt}
I let myself become trapped in a dark abyss of swirling rage and madness...${prompt};Je me suis laissé piéger dans un sombre abîme de rage et de folie... ${prompt}
Raogrimm...${prompt};Raogrimm...${prompt}
People are capable of kindness beyond angels, yet we also commit sins that would put a demon to shame...${prompt};Les gens sont capables de bonté au-delà des anges, pourtant nous commettons aussi des péchés qui feraient honte à un démon... ${prompt}
We all stand precariously on the edge between darkness and light... And when we fall, we are greeted by only madness and chaos.${prompt};Nous sommes tous en équilibre précaire sur le bord entre les ténèbres et la lumière... Et quand nous tombons, nous ne sommes accueillis que par la folie et le chaos. ${prompt}
And so I have fallen...${prompt};Et j'ai sombré...${prompt}
Quite an interesting show you put on.${prompt};Un spectable plutôt intéressant.${prompt}
I don't know. It could have used a little more excitement.${prompt};
The Galka can never do anything right.${prompt};
The Archduke of Jeuno and... What are you two doing here!?${prompt};
We come to reap the seeds that we have sown.${wait-animation: 2};
You've performed your duty well, as ignorant as you are.${wait-animation: 3};
I can see that we still have a little more cleaning up to do, but that won't be a problem.${prompt};
What are you going on about? Give us some answers!${prompt};
Listen carefully, you sorry excuses for sentient beings. The Crystal Line will soon be revived and the Gate of the Gods will open.${prompt};
That is when the true Vana'diel of legend will be reborn.${prompt};
Eternal paradise. The land of the gods. The dream we Zilart have held on to for ten thousand years is about to become a reality.${prompt};
Zilart? You... You can't be! That civilization perished thousands of years ago!${prompt};
The great bane will devour the fair land of Vana'diel.${prompt};
The ancient seal will be broken, awakening nightmares of ages past.${prompt};
The blood of innocents will soak the earth, and the world will fall into fear and despair.${prompt};
Hah! Galka, Humes, beastmen--no life on this planet has any purpose or meaning.${prompt};
Like I told you before, we will not be handing over Vana'diel to anyone. This is our world.${prompt};
Yes, I am no longer sensing the impurities that were blocking the power that lies deep within Vana'diel. The â€œnoiseâ€ has gone.${prompt};
Simply defeating â€œhimâ€ twenty years ago did not silence the noise.${wait-animation: 1};
We ran into a snag. We were unable to release him from the crystal with our power alone.${prompt};
However, with the Talekeeper, we had what we needed. But there is no need to go into the details of that here.${prompt};
Wait...;
I can hear them...;
I can hear the five lifeforces...${prompt};
I can hear them approaching...;
Minions of the Crystal.${prompt};
But as one bright star shines through the clouds at night...${prompt};
And as one song rings clear above the roar of beasts...${prompt};
We hold to one hope in these darkest of times.${prompt};
This world is nothing but a grave, and you are the maggots that squirm through the rotting corpse.${prompt};
It is time we put an end to Vana'diel as it is now.${prompt};
Hear us! We sing the song of hope...and your requiem! ${wait-animation: 1};
That they will come, with the wisdom of ages and the strength of thousands, to deliver us from our plight.${prompt};
We await the awakening of the Warriors of the Crystal.${prompt};
Warriors of the Crystal!?${prompt};
Come forth, Warriors of the Crystal, and cleanse this world of the filth that plagues it.${prompt};
Farewell, lowly vermin. Your time is up.${prompt};
This is the beginning of the end.${prompt};
Finish them, Warriors of the Crystal!${wait-animation: 1};
Zeid! Are you alright?${wait-animation: 2};
Ughhh...;
Don't underestimate them... Their power is immeasurable...${prompt};
No! ${name-player}!${wait-animation: 1};
Stop!${wait-animation: 1};
You'd have to be crazy to stay any longer. We've got to get out of here!${prompt};
Lion!?${prompt};
Oh, no you don't!${wait-animation: 1};
Raogrimm!?${prompt};
I can still draw energy from this land. If I can concentrate it for one last time, I may be able to slow them down.${prompt};
Raogrimm...${prompt};
There is no salvation for me. The Raogrimm who you once knew is gone forever.${prompt};
I expect no forgiveness for what I have done, but...${prompt};
Don't let them have Vana'diel.;
Now, go!${prompt};
Come on! This way, hurry!${prompt};
Farewell, brave warrior!${wait-animation: 1};
One does not need to be a prophet to foresee the outcome of this battle. However, I do not fear death.${prompt};
My true self died thirty years ago... All that remains is an empty shell...${prompt};
Cornelia... Finally, we may meet again...${prompt};
Hey, ${name-player}. Are you alright?${prompt};
You mean you had forgotten what had happened at Castle Zvahl?${prompt};
Hmm...;
You must have lost your memory from the overwhelming shock of the whole experience.${prompt};
But by the looks of you, everything else seems to be working.${prompt};
See that staircase over there? When you're feeling a little better, walk up those stairs and come to the room at the end of the hallway.${prompt};
There's someone I'd like you to meet. I'll go there first and tell him that you're coming.${prompt};
Oh, and here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]}. Think of it as a present from a friend.${prompt};
See you again.${prompt};

${wait-animation: 1};
Arrrg, welcome t'Norg.;
I'm Gilgamesh, the leader of these scallywags. Me daughter's filled me in on your tale.${prompt};
I've had me suspicions about Jeuno fer years. That's why I had Lion investigatin' these past months.${prompt};
But blimey! I had no idear that the Archduke and his wee brother were Zilarrrt.${prompt};
That ancient civilization perished so long ago, there be no record of it.${prompt};
And who be these five Warriors of the Crystal?${prompt};
If they really are the Warriors that legend speaks of...${prompt};
Does this mean that the â€œbaneâ€ the song sings of...is us?${prompt};
We will cause the blood of innocents to soak the earth? We will cause the world to fall into fear and despair?${prompt};
So we are the plague that the Warriors of the Crystal have come to cure?${prompt};
I don't know nothin' 'bout no Crystal Warriors or ancient legends, but I do know I'm not gonna sit around waitin' fer these Zilart to take over the world.${prompt};
â€œCleanse the world?â€ â€œBeginning of the end?â€ That be a lot of fancy talk.${prompt};
But let's see them say that in front of yours truly! I'm not runnin' away from no fight!${prompt};
But how can we stop Kam'lanaut's plan?${prompt};
We're settin' out fer the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};
The Temple of Uggalepih?${prompt};
While not as ancient as Fei'Yin, I do know of some old ruins in the Temple of Uggalepih, beyond the Yuhtunga Jungle.${prompt};
Years ago, I journeyed there, thinking some booty had to be hidden in a place so ancient. That is where I met up with this strange old woman.${prompt};
â€œAre the ancient spirits still in slumber? Come again when the minions awake.â€${prompt};
Arrrg, and then she vanished into thin air.${prompt};
I didn't know what to make of it then, but I never thought it would be somethin' big like this.${prompt};
I'm sure that old lady must know what's goin' on. ${name-player}, I want ya t'travel to the Temple of Uggalepih and find her.${prompt};
And before you go, stop by an' see the Chieftainness in Kazham. If you tell her I sent ya, she may be of some help.${prompt};
No one's going to believe such a crazy story. We're going t'have t'work by ourselves on this one.${prompt};
I believe...${prompt};
Aldo! How long's it been? What brings you all the way out here?${prompt};
Lion, Gilgamesh... It's Verena. She's disappeared.${prompt};
But why would she go anywhere now?;
I have a bad feeling about this...${prompt};
It may have somethin' t'do with Kam'lanaut's plan.${prompt};
I'll help you look for her, Aldo. If anything happened to Verena...${prompt};
No, Lion. I have another job fer you.${prompt};
What?${prompt};
Lion, I appreciate your words, but let me gather some information around Jeuno first.${prompt};
Just knowing that Kam'lanaut is up to no good is a start. If I find out anything new, you will be the first to know.${prompt};

Arrrg, I heard from Lion about what happened at Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt};
Our ancient friend called that island floatin' over Qufim â€œTu'Liaâ€...the Gate of the Gods.${prompt};
Eald'narche also said that only those who have been blessed by the light and whose power has been accepted by the crystal can pass through the gate.${prompt};
What does that boy think he's doing, playing some kind of game with Vana'diel as his prize?${prompt};
Kamui. Have you ever heard the name Ro'Maeve? Eald'narche mentioned it before he left Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt};
Ro'Maeve? Hmmm...${prompt};
On the northern tip of Mindartia is a wild, untamed region called the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. In this area there remains a set of ancient ruins.${prompt};
I remember those ruins being referred to as Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
However, those ruins, also known as the Temple of Desolation, have long been feared by many.${prompt};
Arrrg, a frightenin' place that Zi'Tah be. Ya never know what's gonna creep up behind yer back.${prompt};
${name-player}, take care when traveling up there, unless ya want to be swimmin' in Davy Jones's locker.${prompt};
Okay, I'll be careful.${wait-animation: 1};
Hold on there, missy. You're not going with ${name-player} this time. I need ya t'travel t'Jeuno and keep an eye on them beastmen.${prompt};
But...but!${prompt};
Don't talk back t'me. You know what ya have t'do, now go do it! I'll stay here and watch after me hideout.${prompt};
...${prompt};

##### ZM9: fin #########

Gnyah-hah-hoh! A fine lookin' adventurer you are. I heard that if the price is right, your kind will do almost anything.${prompt};
How's about it? Are ya game?${prompt};
Accept Muzaffar's offer?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
That's too bad. I was ready to pay a bundle... Guess I'll just have to find someone with a little more moxie.${prompt};
That's the answer I was lookin' for!;
As you know, we sell items here that are forbidden to import and export on the mainland.${prompt};
But as of late there's been mighty more demand than our supply can handle. We just don't have enough people to keep up. That's where you come in.${prompt};
If you can make it here, you can make it to where all those forbidden items are found. You bring me some, and I'll pay you well. Oh, and I wouldn't try sellin' the goods at any other shop. You won't get ten gil for them.${prompt};
This is what I need: ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Bring them to me in sets. Four items make one set. I'll pay you for one set at a time.${prompt};
You already forgot what I want you to bring? Not that smart for an adventurer, are you? Now listen up, I don't want to have to tell you again.${prompt};
Gnyah-hoh-hoh! If it isn't a set of ${item-plural: 1[2]}! Here's the payment I promised you.${prompt};
If you ever come across any more, bring them to me, 'cause I'll be happy to take them off your hands for you. Like they say, â€œYou scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.â€${prompt};
If you ever have any more ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, come to Muzaffar. I'll be happy to take them off your hands for you.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
What am I to do...?${prompt};
Rations? We have more than enough. But the drink...these hooligans guzzle it down like it was water. We're always low on supply!${prompt};
Ah, you came at the perfect time. You're one of those adventurers, aren't you? Well, I need you to run an errand for me in the Yhoator Jungle.${prompt};
Deep in that jungle, the wild Opo-opos brew a special drink by fermenting berries in the trees.${prompt};
You must be wondering how you get there, right? You'll find the Yhoator Jungle just beyond the Yuhtunga Jungle. But you should watch your back. There are a lot of wild animals creeping around in that place.${prompt};
Don't worry. I'll pay you for your trouble.${prompt};
Will you help me out?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Maybe some other time.${prompt};
I can't thank you enough! Now take this ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} and fill it chock full of that Opo-Opo brew. I'll be waiting!${prompt};
Well, I guess you adventurers must be busy with your adventuring. I'll try to find somebody else to go.${prompt};
Oh, have you changed your mind?${prompt};
Okay, now listen up. The Opo-opos don't hide their brew in the Yuhtunga Jungle, only in the Yhoator Jungle.${prompt};
When you find one of the trees those little buggers are making it in, fill this ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} up to the brim, and bring it back to me.${prompt};
Mmm-mmm! The color! The aroma! Only nature can work magic like this!${prompt};
Now if only those hooligans would appreciate it! Knowing them, this batch will be gone by the end of the night...${prompt};
Here's a little something for your trouble.;
Now, I have to remember to double our next order from our suppliers...${prompt};
Oh, thanks again for helping me out. What's beyond this door? Why, that's the kitchen--the heart of Norg. I can't let you in there, you know.${prompt};
My name is Jaucribaix, and I am the blacksmith here in Norg. I don't waste my time with that crystal synthesis rubbish. I forge all my katana in the traditional manner.${prompt};
Our leader, Gilgamesh, has asked me to forge him a katana, but I am in somewhat of a bind.${prompt};
A katana is a work of art. I refuse to replace the traditional methods of smithing with modern synthesis. However, my supply of materials is currently running low.${prompt};
If these items were easy to come by, I would go myself. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I require your assistance.${prompt};
Listen to Jaucribaix's request?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I see.;
I apologize for taking up your valuable time.${prompt};
Ah, have you reconsidered my offer?${prompt};
I am grateful for your assistance. Would you be so kind as to fetch me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is for the flame that fuels my furnace, and the ${item-singular: 1[2]} is the perfect material for melting the iron. Both are needed to forge a true katana blade.${prompt};
To learn of where you may come across these items, ask my pupils.${prompt};
Tell them I sent you, and they will assist you with your preparations for the journey. Also, if you come across any trouble, you may ask them for further aid. However, I doubt you will require it.${prompt};
To learn of where you may come across the items I wish you to bring me, ask my pupils.${prompt};
Tell them I sent you, and they will assist you with your preparations for the journey. Also, if you come across any trouble, you may ask them for further aid. However, I doubt you will require it.${prompt};
When you have gathered the two items, bring them directly to me and I will begin my work.${prompt};
Wonderful. These are the materials that I require. I apologize, but I must hurry or Gilgamesh will have my head. I will reward you for your services when I have finished the katana.${prompt};
How long will it take, you ask? A good blade takes at least three full days to complete. Come to me then. You need not worry. I will be right here.${prompt};
Again, I apologize for not being able to give you your reward sooner.${prompt};
My work is not yet complete. I still require ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[more hour/more hours]. It is not wise to waste your time trying to outrun the clock in this game we call life.${prompt};
Time is like a flowing river--it cannot be sped up or slowed down. We must float along at the pace it has chosen.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, you have finally returned. I was beginning to worry that you had forgotten about your reward.${prompt};
Now where did I put that...${prompt};
Arrrg, if it isn't our little helper ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]!${prompt};
Gilgamesh.${prompt};
Ya did some mighty fine work in gettin' me matey, Jauc, his materials. Thanks t'you, I got meself a fine new blade.${prompt};
Listen carefully, ${name-player}. Within a katana, the soul of its maker and the soul of its wielder are intertwined.${prompt};
That newfangled crystal synthesis you adventurers be usin' is all fine fer mantles and arrows, but it can't copy the traditional methods. One must know the essentials behind a blade if they ever want t'master it.${prompt};
That's why we make adventurers like you go on quests like that last one. We want you t'know the true meanin' of wieldin' a blade like this.${prompt};
Know the meaning of the power you hold, and only then will you find the true power within. That be â€œbushido,â€ the way of the samurai.${prompt};
Yer adventures have already trained you t'become a samurai. Now all that's left is for ya t'pledge your faith t'this blade. Yer power within will do the rest.${prompt};
Rid yerself of all unnecessary thoughts and feel the world around ya. Make yer soul an unclouded mirror...a motionless pond. Project yerself into yer blade. This be the legendary skill used by the samurai--â€œMeikyo Shisui.â€${prompt};
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}. This blade was forged fer ya. Pledge your life t'her an' she won't let ya down.${prompt};
You accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]} from Gilgamesh.;
You can now become a samurai.${prompt};
I wish to give you your reward, but you seem to be carrying too much already. Come back when you have more room in your pack.${prompt};
Crystal technology has helped Vana'diel prosper, but at the cost of traditional methods, now lost forever.${prompt};
Just as the old is replaced by the new, the world is constantly changing. One day, one may no longer be able to live by a single blade alone.${prompt};
So, you need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. I see Master Jaucribaix is starting another project. Let me tell you where to find that item.${prompt};
You won't just find one lying around anywhere. Forging a katana is somewhat of a ritual. The smith focuses all his spiritual energy into the task. Thus, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} used must be from a spiritual place as well.${prompt};
Beyond the Meriphataud Mountains is an ancient forest known as the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There you will find a tree that has been standing for over a thousand years.${prompt};
Only a branch from this tree is suitable for the flame that burns in Master Jaucribaix's furnace. However, take care when traveling in Zi'Tah, as it is a land of much mystery and danger.${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. You will know what to do with it when you arrive at the tree. Take care not to lose it, as it is a very rare item.${prompt};
What? You need another ${item-singular: 1[2]}? And after I told you how important it was! If you want me to give you another one, bring me one ${item-singular: 2[2]} and two ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I will think about it.${prompt};
If you want me to give you another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, bring me one ${item-singular: 2[2]} and two ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I will think about it.${prompt};
I do not mean to sound rude, but this is a very important item. Do not go losing it again.${prompt};
Welcome back from your journey. Please deliver that ${item-singular: 0[2]} directly to Master Jaucribaix.${prompt};
What does an adventurer like you need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for? Oh, Master Jaucribaix sent you. Then I guess I have to give you this.${prompt};
To the untrained eye, this ${item-singular: 1[2]} may look like a simple piece of scrap iron, but it is actually a rare ore from the Far East.${prompt};
It contains metals not found on Mindartia or Quon. By processing this in a special way, it will become the perfect material for melting iron in the Master's furnace.${prompt};
Your job is to find a bomb to consume this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. When a bomb eats it, it will be refined into ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Somewhere in the Konschtat Highlands is a small cave with a charred floor. It is there you will find a bomb that will consume the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Place it on the charred area, and retrieve the ${item-singular: 0[2]} from the bomb that appears.${prompt};
Place the ${item-singular: 1[2]} on the charred area in a cave in the Konschtat Highlands, and retrieve the ${item-singular: 0[2]} from the bomb that appears.${prompt};
You need another ${item-singular: 1[2]}? Fine, but these do not come cheap. I will give you a new one only in exchange for ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} do not come cheap. I will give you a new one only in exchange for ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Here is the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I promised, but you should really try to take better care of your belongings...${prompt};
I see you made it back safely. I hope you didn't have trouble with the bomb. The ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Oh, you can give that directly to Master Jaucribaix.${prompt};
You do not have to worry about your reward. Master Jaucribaix is a man of his word. Time is necessary for him to complete his work.${prompt};
You must be patient. Nothing good can be gained by rushing things.${prompt};
You must not set any limits in your life, as your progress will end when you reach them. Always set your goals high, and you will continue to grow stronger.${prompt};
If ya ever have any problems with those pesky little Tonberries, just come to yer buddy Magephaud.;
It doesn't look like you're in that much trouble, though.${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh...;
You've been out playin' with the Tonberries, haven't ya? Don't try denyin' it. I can tell jus' by lookin' at ya.${prompt};
I can see them Tonberries' hate fer ya. Now listen close, matey, if ya want t'live.${prompt};
The little green beasties on this island are all connected. When ya kill one, the others around all get stronger. It's their hate fer ya that drives 'em.${prompt};
But today's yer lucky day, me matey. I happen t'know a special way of appeasin' those Tonberries.${prompt};
Har-har-harrr! Ya think I'd tell ya fer free? Bring me three ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Then I'll let ya in on me little secret.${prompt};
Bring me three ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Then I'll let ya in on me little secret.;
I won't pressure ya into anything if ya think ya can handle the devils on yer own...${prompt};
One...two...three. Three ${item-plural: 0[2]}, just like I asked fer. Okay. Let me fill ya in on how to soothe these slimy savages.${prompt};
Way back when I was still young and didn't know about the hate--the rancor--of the Tonberries, I killed a couple...just like you did.${prompt};
Then, one day when me and me mateys wuz plunderin' an old temple, I met an old Tonberry who understood the words of men.${prompt};
It was he who told me of the Tonberries' hate, and that only he could soothe the rancor heaped upon me.${prompt};
But then he told me t'fork over me gil! That be a beastman fer ya!${prompt};
So I told him t'show me some evidence before I was handin' over any gil, and with a wave of his wand, he relieved me of the Tonberries' rancor.${prompt};
And then, did I pay the gil? Of course I didn't! I hit him with a â€œSneak Attackâ€ and swiped his key t'the room. Then I used me â€œFleeâ€ and I was gone like the wind.${prompt};
Ya get all that? Now ya know what t'do. Here's the key t'that room.${prompt};
Don't get the wrong idea, now. I only told ya I'd tell you the way t'rid yerself of the rancor, not actually rid ya of it.${prompt};
You've got the key. What ya do with it is up to you, but watch yer back if yer ever travelin' around that ancient temple.${prompt};
Well, shivivi me timbers! Dat ${item-singular: 0[2]} you're carryin'! I'be seen dat before!${prompt};
Me and my ninja mateys here in Norg worked day and night and night and day to come up wit' some new-fangled ninjutsu. But we made it a little too fangled...${prompt};
...and we were neber-eber able to use it. So we trew da ting into one of Norg's baults, and forgot about it. Where did you find dat anyway?${prompt};
You caught it fishin'? Dis's gotta be da work ob dem fishy-washy Sahagin.${prompt};
Dey probably trew it away when dey saw it was blank. Dey didn't know der's a special way to make the writin' bisable.${prompt};
What does it say? Oh, I forgot dat years ago. But I do remember how to read it.${prompt};
Yeah, it was dat metod dat prebented us from usin' da scroll in da first place... But anyway, take dat ${item-singular: 0[2]} to da hot spring on Horlais Peak.${prompt};
When ya put da scroll in da water, da letters will appear, and boila-la! You're done!${prompt};
Why all da way to Horlais Peak? Well, if it was easy to get dere, wouldn't be much ob a super-special secret scroll now, would it?${prompt};
Da only reason we stopped makin' dem was because nobody-buddy wanted to walk all da way to dose hot springs...${prompt};
If you wanna read da scroll, jus' take it to da hot spring on Horlais Peak and dip it in da water. If it's da wrong water, the words will neber appear.${prompt};
Wait! You're one of those adventurers, aren't you? You're supposed to help people out, right? Right?${prompt};
Can I ask you a favor? Can I?;
${selection-lines};
I guess.;
I'm pretty busy right now.${prompt};
Busy? Then who's going to help me? Who, ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady], who? Tell me who!${prompt};
You're back!${prompt};
Great! If it wasn't for you, who knows what I'd do. I really need some help. This should be no problem for you. Really, it shouldn't.${prompt};
You know that the cave you used to get here is called the Sea Serpent Grotto, right? And you already know about those fishy-looking Sahagin that live down there, don't you?${prompt};
Well, I need you to go and get me something from their hidden vault. That's not too hard, is it? I mean, this is a matter of life or death! Life or death!${prompt};
Before the Sahagin took over, the pirates here used to use the grotto as a storage area. To protect their treasure from thieves...and themselves, they built numerous hidden doors.${prompt};
Recently the Sahagin have added tricks and traps to those doors, so you have to watch out. There's no way I could do it myself, but you? You can do it! I know you can!${prompt};
From what I heard, the treasure vault is not that deep in the grotto. All you have to do is go down there and bring me back something--anything! You're not going to back out on me, are you? Are you?${prompt};
You're back! You did it! I can't believe it!;
So, what did you bring me? ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? I heard that the Sahagin worship these things. Pretty good work for a fish, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Oh yeah, your reward. Here, take this.;
What am I going to do with this? That's none of your business!${prompt};
'Old on there. Yer that adventurer, ${name-player}, everybody's talkin' 'bout. Perfect timin' there, matey. I need a hand.${prompt};
That storage room I jus' mentioned--I need somebody t'go down there and fetch me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Unless the Sahagin have thrown 'er in the sea, she should still be down there.${prompt};
Don't think I'd ask ya t'go down for nothin' now, would ya? There's a pretty penny in it fer ya, if yer interested.${prompt};
Whaddaya say, matey?;
${selection-lines};
Arrrg, sign me up.;
I forgot my eye patch at home.${prompt};
Well, ya can't go huntin' fer booty without yer eye patch...${prompt};
So, yer ready to hunt fer some booty?${prompt};
Spoken like a true pirate! Just go down t'the storage room and bring back the booty. It be as simple as takin' candy from a baby.${prompt};
I'll be waitin' 'ere for ya.${prompt};
Where's the storage room? Remember passin' by a false door on yer way to Norg? There's a 'idden door to the west of that one, but if ya don't have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ya may have some trouble.${prompt};
Stay along the walls and ya should find a hidden passageway. Ya made it t'Norg, so findin' it should be no problem. Jus' watch out fer the monsters lurkin' down there.${prompt};
That's what I was lookin' fer! Now, when openin' these, ya gotta be careful of traps. Ya do this...then turn this...then wiggle this...then...${prompt};
Arrrg! Its contents are still intact after all these years. Oh yeah, yer reward. Take this. It'll come in handy on yer landlubbin' adventures.${prompt};
Rottin' floor, fallen crates... Condition of me storage room don't sound so good. I'll have t'head down there with me mateys t'check it out.${prompt};
Arrrg, make sure ya stop by Kazham and visit the Chieftainness, Jakoh Wahcondalo, before heading off t'the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};
If ya tell her I sent ya, she should give ya some help. Now get a move on! There's no time t'lose.${prompt};
So we needs ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} to get deeper into the temple... Even I don't know what lurks down there.${prompt};
I can see potential in you, ${name-player}, but don't go doin' anything stupid now. We want to sees you back 'ere in one piece!${prompt};
Seven stone monuments? Arrrg, me thinks me saw one in the Yuhtunga or Yhoator Jungle. Can't remember which one, though...${prompt};
And that be all me knows. Maybe ya saw one o' 'em durin' a mission ya went on. Try t'remember. If ya can't, ya can always ask yer adventurin' mateys.${prompt};
I'm sorry that I have no more t'tell ya. If that old bat in the temple hadn't been so secretive...${prompt};
Arrrg! You've gathered all the jewels! You'd make a mighty fine pirate. No wonder me daughter likes ya. Now all ya have t'do is take those to the ancient temple on Zepwell Island.${prompt};
You'll find Zepwell Island off the southwest tip of Quon. What, you say that's where you found one of the stone monuments? Well, then ya don't need me directions now, do ya?${prompt};
Delkfutt's Tower?;
I jus' got some information 'bout Verena. If that piece of info is correct, then that tower is where Verena has been taken!${prompt};
And t'make things worse, our Zilart friends from Jeuno seem t'be involved. I've already sent some of me mateys t'help Aldo, but I have a bad feelin' about this. Hurry t'Qufim!${prompt};
We here at Norg sometimes do business in and around the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. One big forest, that place is.${prompt};
No, it ain't nothin' like the jungles around here, but it sure be full of surprises. Don't go gettin' caught up in the scenery, or ya may find yourself lost!${prompt};
ãƒ©ã‚¤ã‚ªãƒ³ã®è©±${prompt};
We made Norg our headquarters about thirty years ago.${prompt};
The Crystal War and the unification of countries...all this was unthinkable back then.${prompt};
They were hard times, but no one had their complaints.${prompt};
ãƒ©ã‚¤ã‚ªãƒ³ã®è©±${prompt};
Open the door?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Target out of range.${prompt};
That guy Rafid over there was the only survivor after a sea monster attacked his ship.${prompt};
One of our ships found him floating in the water and brought him back here. He is lucky to be alive, but he has lost his memory.${prompt};
Though even with the loss, he hasn't forgot the tricks of his trade. He's one of the best workers we have here.${prompt};
Get his memory back? I'd like to see that as much as the next guy. If only there was some way...${prompt};
When we pirates attack other ships, we call up the souls of those lost at sea to do our dirty work. It's a little bit different from the summoning magic you adventurers use.${prompt};
But don't ask me to explain how. I ain't no magician, you know.${prompt};
You're lookin' for a Rent-a-Room, are ya? What? You miss your bed in yer homeland, eh? Poor adventurer! Ya have any tissue? I can't stop crying.${prompt};
Go down those stairs and turn right. Head through that cave and you'll find the auction house.${prompt};
In front of the auction house you'll find some moogles. Ya can cuddle up with one of those if yer afraid of the dark.${prompt};
Donya tink ninja's da bestest job in da wald? Two weapons in hand on da battlefield. Two fryin' pans at home in da kitchen.${prompt};
But ninjas aren't all about cookin'. Dere was dis one ten years ago dat was stronger dan stronger dan strong.${prompt};
At da time, people eben said dat she was stronger dan Gilgamesh! I fought wit her many a time, but I could neber match her skill.${prompt};
If only she was still around... You coulda asked her all about how t'be a ninja!${prompt};
Haven't seen ya 'round these parts, landlubber. Must be one'a those new-fangled adventurers. So, how ya likin' our hideout?${prompt};
When Ifrit, Lord of the Inferno,;
Woke from his age-old slumber,;
Magma poured from the jagged cracks,;
As the ocean floor ripped asunder.${prompt};
Maybe Ifrit's Cauldron on Mount Yuhtunga gets its name from this old island poem. I used to think that Ifrit was just a constellation, but maybe he really does exist...${prompt};
Take a look at me! Don't you think I'm pretty big for a Tarutaru? The mucho-macho Gabide next to me says he's small for a Galka, but he's still three times my size!${prompt};
I hope someday I'll grow up to be as big as the Great Star Tree back in my hometown.${prompt};
Not gonna happen, huh...${prompt};
My name's Gabide. My adventures as a paladin have taken me all over Vana'diel, but I'd have to say this sea cave would have to top my list of amazing places.${prompt};
And to think that this is the hideout of the pirates who attacked me when I was still a young adventurer... But if it wasn't for that fateful day, I wouldn't be who I am now.${prompt};
When you think about it that way, I guess I can't get too angry about what happened.${prompt};
The volcano on this island, Mount Yuhtunga, is still active. They say that Elshimo was created when it erupted thousands of years ago.${prompt};
What, is the baby adventurer lost? I don't have time for babysittin' landlubbers like you. You got a brain--use it!${prompt};
We pirates call tha cave connectin' Norg t'tha mainland the â€œSea Serpent Grotto.â€ Just like there be beastmen on tha continents, tha grotto has its share of slimy dwellers. Namely, tha Sahagin.${prompt};
And t'make things worse, those nasty little beasts have filled tha place up with trick doors so ya can't get t'tha deeper parts of the cave.${prompt};
We used t'have a vault down there, but nobody's been able t'get close to it fer years.${prompt};
For guys like us that live on the sea, you adventurers sure come in handy. You're our only source of info from the mainland.${prompt};
But once you head out into the wide open sea...now that's our territory. If we get your ship in our sights, there's no escapin'. We may be friends today, but who knows about tomorrow?${prompt};
Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. My name is Rafid, but that's all I remember about my past. I came here a year ago when my ship was attacked and I was rescued by the pirates.${prompt};
The jungle that covers this island is so big, it's been divided into two--the Yhoator Jungle and the Yuhtunga Jungle.${prompt};
I wouldn't recommend traveling without a map, since you could get lost, or...eaten. Remember, it's a jungle out there.;
Har har! Get it?${prompt};
We deal in all sorts of goods that you won't find in your everyday living room. No sir-ee. Looking at stuff like this reminds me of how diverse this wide, wide world is.${prompt};
This door leads to the quarters of our leader, Gilgamesh. He doesn't waste his time with landlubbin' worms like you, so get out of my face before I give ya a personal tour of Davy Jones' locker.${prompt};
So you're the adventurer they call ${name-player}. I've heard about you from our leader. You can pass, but you'd best watch your mouth around him, or you'll be swimmin' with the fishes.${prompt};
I'm the gaudy-bodyguard of this place. You make one wrong move, and I will smack and kick and punch and whack and pummel and smash and crush and grind your bones into powder...and then kick you some more.${prompt};
You follow the rules, I'll let you live. You break them, I break you.${prompt};
Gah-hah-hah! You're probably wonderin' what the hell an auction house's doin' down here in these damn caves. We're pirates, whaddaya expect?${prompt};
Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]! This way to the exit.;
You don't happen to have any extra gil, do ya? I'm savin' up for a new pet parrot.${prompt};
Hey, you're an adventurer, right? Go through this tunnel and you'll get to the auction house. And say hi to the moogles for me!${prompt};
Unlike armor, the strength of a weapon depends solely on the skill of its owner. Just because one's blade is sharp doesn't mean one can wield it to its full potential.${prompt};
But an adventurer such as yourself would have already known that...${prompt};
You ever heard of those lantern-swingin', knife-wieldin' Tonberries? Travel to the old temple in the Yhoator Jungle and you'll get your fill of the little beasts.${prompt};
Deep within the Sea Serpent Grotto, the Sahagin have built a special door that can only be opened with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Ya say ya want ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? Ha! Why don't ya try askin' one of the lil' devils?${prompt};
Welcome t'Norg. Feel free t'have a look about our headquarters.${prompt};
Hold on there, ${choice-player-gender}[buddy/lady]. Nobody, not even adventurers, is allowed through here.${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh. Feast your eyes on these beauties. You won't find stuff like this anywhere!${prompt};
Please, stay and have a look. You may find something you can only buy here.${prompt};
Can I interest you in some armor forged in the surrounding regions?${prompt};
Magic scrolls! Magic scrolls! We've got parchment hot off the sheep!${prompt};
Hiya! I can deliver packages to anybody, anywhere, anytime. What do you say?${prompt};
We can deliver parcels to any residence in Vana'diel.${prompt};
Welcome to Norg's auction house. How may I be of service?${prompt};
Money can't buy you love, but it can get you some pretty good stuff. How can I help you?${prompt};
What, ya gotta problem with me usin' a barrel? Ya think I'm too short? Shaddup 'n tell me what ya want.${prompt};
Wh-what...huh...oh! I don't get many people talking to me, the number â€œ4â€ clerk... What can I do you for?${prompt};
The door is locked tight.${prompt};

Hasn't changed a bit, has he? Always was a weak little worm. If I saw his face, I would smack him so hard...${prompt};
Well, at least he's finally learned the value of this blade. Yomi can now rest in peace...${prompt};
Oh, and let me tell you. I'm not doing this for Ensetsu. I only care about Yomi's daughters...${prompt};
Arrrg, so you're the landlubbin' adventurer that they sent from Bastok.${prompt};
I'm a busy man, so let's cut with the chitchat and get right down to business.${prompt};
Lately, you adventurers are making quite a killin' on items, weapons, and the like. We knew that you were out there, but we didn't think you'd be givin' us this much competition.${prompt};
But rather than gettin' in each other's way, I thought that there might be a way we could work together. What I want ya t'do is give me an idea of what you adventurers are capable of.${prompt};
There are a few items that me mateys couldn't acquire. I want ya t'go and get them.${prompt};
Travel to one of them molten lava falls in Ifrit's Cauldron.${prompt};
If you throw in ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, a monster will appear. Bring back the ${item-singular: 7[2]} that the beast has on it.${prompt};
Do ya think you can handle it, ya landlubber?${prompt};
Hah hah hah! Me landlubbin' adventurer brought back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. It looks like I need to find myself some new mateys! Hah hah hah!${prompt};
I guess this means you've completed your mission. Now let me write you somethin' you can take back to...${prompt};
That won't be necessary, sir.${prompt};
Arrrg, why if it ain't little Ayaya. Ya get prettier every time I sees ya.${prompt};
Gilgamesh. It was fine when you called me that when I was a child, but I'm twenty years old now.${prompt};
So, what brings ya t'these here parts? Come to check up on your adventurer?${prompt};
That is one of the reasons. We wouldn't want you snatching up one of Bastok's best.${prompt};
If I wanted to snatch up Bastok's best, I'd be snatching up the fine samurai standing in front of me. How about it, Ayaya? Leave that boring job of yours and join us!${prompt};
We'd love t'have you. You'd have the chance t'wield your blade whenever you please, not when that president says you can. Arrrg, what d'ya say?${prompt};
While I am flattered by your offer, I am satisfied with, and hold pride in, my current post.${prompt};
I realize that I still have much to learn, but at the same time I feel that I must travel the roads I see fit to travel.${prompt};
Swords and muskets are not made to be drawn. That is what my parents taught me, and those are the words I wish to live by.${prompt};
Ayaya...${prompt};
I have brought with me a document from the president himself. It covers the treatment of Bastokan adventurers, as well as overseas trade guidelines.${prompt};
You may want to read over the details at a later time. You need not give an answer now. However, I trust that Norg will take steps in the right direction.${prompt};
Arrrg, ya don't leave much room fer choice now, do you?${prompt};
I'll take that as a compliment. I learned everything I needed to know from the years I spent here in training.${prompt};
Okay, okay. You go back and tell the old president I said hello.;
Oh, and don't ya forget t'talk to Ryoma before you leave. It's the least ya could do fer him.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but that will have to wait until another day... However, maybe next time I will bring along my younger sister.${prompt};
Your assignment in Norg is complete. You may return to Bastok now, and do not forget to report to Naji upon your arrival.${prompt};
Who tha hell are you?;
${name-player}? Never heard of ya. How am I supposed to remember the name of one puny ant when there's millions of ya swarmin' around?${prompt};
Do a little work around here, and there might be somebody that'll remember your ugly face...no guarantees, though.${prompt};
Ya gotta get people t'trust ya. Once people do, you'll start makin' a name fer yerself 'round here.${prompt};
${name-player}? I mighta hearda somebody that went by that name, but I meets a lot of people in me line of work.${prompt};
Don't look so upset there, matey. It takes a lot t'get people t'remember ya. It all starts with trust!${prompt};
Yer an adventurer, go an' help people out. Little by little, they'll begin t'trust ya, but don't expect anythin' right away.${prompt};
Wait a minute, I remember you...Mich...no...${name-player}, right?${prompt};
Ya see, do a little work, and people start recognizin' ya. Keep up tha good work!${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}. Hear yer name lots 'round these parts lately. Why, I remembers when you was nothin' but a measly insect.${prompt};
Thanks t'me advice, you're doin' quite well here in Norg.${prompt};
Oh, ${name-player}. I was just talkin' to me mateys about ya the other day.${prompt};
Nothin' bad, of course. They had all heard about yer deeds fer Norg. Some are even startin' t'think that maybe all you adventurers ain't so bad after all.${prompt};
${name-player}! There's hardly a soul in Norg that doesn't know yer bloody name.${prompt};
Oh, sorry 'bout that. Me mum never did teach me no manners. I'll watch me damn mouth...I mean, I'll watch me mouth from now on.${prompt};
${name-player}...${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] ${name-player}. You've become quite the household name 'round Norg.${prompt};
All me mateys keep askin' me if I can introduce them to ya. You've made quite a reputation for yerself!${prompt};
Lookin' at ya gets me thinkin' like I should leave tha life on the open sea, and become an adventurer!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] ${name-player}! There's already rumors of yer last adventure goin' 'round Norg. You're startin' t'become some sorta legend! ${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}! Next t'our leader, Gilgamesh, yer the most famous person in all'a Norg! Some of me mateys are even callin' ya a hero!${prompt};
May the light of the Dawn Goddess shine down upon ya in all yer journeys 'round Vana'diel!${prompt};

Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Yippee! This is my lucky day!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.${prompt};
What phenomena, you ask? Well, there are these giant crystals, you see!;
And from those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth...${prompt};
These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems.;
Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt};
Guess what!${prompt};
We finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt};
Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!;
Except they didn't appreciate being woken up...;
We were attacked...;
We were bested-wested...${prompt};
Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
I bet you could do it!;
You call yourself an adventurer, right? Give it a shot!${prompt};
Take up the challenge?;
${selection-lines};
Bring it on!;
Ah, no, thanks...${prompt};
Great!;
Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will awaken the giant crystal that is found ${choice: 2}[in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are!;
Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from me. Okey-dokey?${prompt};
If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did! ${prompt};
As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again.;
I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...${prompt};
What nonsense!;
If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now, is there?${prompt};
How'd it go!?${wait-36: 1};
Wowy-wow-wow! You defeated a prime avatar!${prompt};
...I see.;
The prime avatar said that to you?;
I wonder what it could mean.${prompt};
...There is no need to understand...;
...You will forget what I have said...${prompt};
Y-you, you're...!;

Huh? I went all spacey-wacey for a moment there...${prompt};
Um, who were you again?;
Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?${prompt};
Did I tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst already?${prompt};
You are now able to summon ${choice: 2}[Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].${prompt};
Huh? What?;
Do I know where Ildy-Goldy is?${prompt};
Yeah, you justaru missed him.;
He went off towards Cape Terrrigan with the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of air${color: 1}.${prompt};
Ildy-Goldy will wipe the floor with that avatar.;
I wonder what kind of research data he'll bring back for us?${prompt};
Hm? Did he seem a little different from usual?${prompt};
Well, now that you mention it, he did ask me to give this to any adventurers that came looking for him...${prompt};
I guess that must mean you.;
Here you go. Seems like a clear invitation to go take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan yourself.${prompt};
I've given you what Ildy-Goldy had me hold on to. You should be on your way to Cape Teriggan.${prompt};
...Hm?;
You're going to help out Ildy-Goldy, but first you want to take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan under your own steam?${prompt};
Check it out yourself?;
${selection-lines};
I like to do things my way...;
All on my lonesome...?${prompt};
...You got guts, kid.;
Well, either way is fine with me.${prompt};
What!?;
You lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!?${prompt};
What kind of an adventurer are you...?;
Well, don't go losing this one, okay?${prompt};
...We m-m-meet again...;
...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt};
...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions.;
...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?${prompt};
..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?${prompt};
Hahaha...;
...Rather than strength without purpose...;
...you should be seeking...true power...${prompt};
We m-m-meet...again...;
I must...fulfill...my charge.${prompt};
You must...seek power...${prompt};
...And I...shall c-c-claim...my due...${prompt};
What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Hrmmm...;
So it's time to use...no...${prompt};
Hello?;
You're an adventurer, right?;
Maybe you can help us out.${prompt};
Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt};
I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist him in his study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt};
But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt};
We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.;
Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt};
Listen, muscle-hussle brain.;
Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt};
Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt};
That's where you come in.;
I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt};
Listen up.;
The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt};
And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt};
...;
Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
You do have a point there...;
I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt};
No, one round could not hurt.${prompt};
You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.;
Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt};
Are you really-dilly sure?;
${selection-lines};
Fork me!;
On second thought...${prompt};
Well, you asked for it!;
Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt};
I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that â€œthe door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.â€${prompt};
I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.;
Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt};
Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt};
Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt};
Are you sure you are ready?;
${selection-lines};
Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!;
My dog ate my ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}.;
Not just yet...${prompt};
Sir, our adventurer has completed ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] preparations and requests a warp.${prompt};
...;
Abracadoodle-strudel-poodle...;
...;
Sha-mone!;
Don't use that excuse on me, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].;
If you want another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, all you have to do ask.${prompt};
If you do not bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]} we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Did you remember to bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
What!?;
You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt};
...;
Sir...${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
(Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)${prompt};
I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another ${item-singular: 1[2]} near a giant crystal.${prompt};
Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.${prompt};
Do you want another ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}?;
${selection-lines};
Fork me baby, one more time.;
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Maybe you can help us outaru!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?${prompt};
These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems.;
Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when POOF, out of nowhere, a prime avatar appeared and sliced 'n diced us down to size.${prompt};
Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt};
Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt};
Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt};
Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt};
I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.${prompt};
This isn't a Mog House, so you can only use the â€œMog Safe,â€ â€œChange Jobs,â€ and â€œDelivery Boxâ€ commands, kupo.${prompt};
You have to pay fee of ${number: 0} gil to transfer your items to the Outlands, kupo. Why? Because the world is a cold place for rogue moogles, kupo.${prompt};
Of course, you can move your items back to your Mog House in town, but if you want to transfer them to the Outlands again, you'll have to pay another fee, kupo. I've got to make a living too, kupo.${prompt};
Transfer items? (Current gil:${number: 1});
${selection-lines};
Pay ${number: 0} gil.;
Don't transfer items.${prompt};
You don't have enough gil, kupo.${prompt};
Item transfer complete, kupo.${prompt};

I am Heiji. I teach my young pupils the ways of the ninja.${prompt};
The fundamentals of ninjutsu lie not in the arms and hands, but in the lower body.${prompt};
My students must learn to utilize their lower body swiftly, precisely, and efficiently, even while under the binds of restricting equipment.${prompt};
However, for training such as this, I require ten ${item-plural: 7[2]}. If carrying so many at one time is a burden for you, feel free to bring them to me one at a time.${prompt};
You have brought me ${number: 0} ${item-given-plurality: 0[2], 7[2]} so far. When you have brought me the tenth one, I will reward you nicely.${prompt};

Hiya! My name's Solby-Maholby! I'm new here, so they put me on tooty-fruity shop duty. I'll give you a super-duper deal on unwanted items!${prompt};
If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} and have a high enough job level.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo for ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.${prompt};
If you still want one, it will cost you ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
Do you wish to rent a chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I do.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
You don't have enough gil.${prompt};
You cannot obtain the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Come back after sorting your inventory.${prompt};
Would you be so kind as to deliver her to ${choice: 3}[the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?${prompt};
Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo.;
First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle.;
We charge a service fee of ${number: 0} Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of.;
My records indicate that you currently have ${number: 1} Allied Notes.${prompt};
Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes.;
Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?${prompt};
Our chocobos do not like traveling in the Sea Serpent Grotto, so we have dug a special exit tunnel leading from here to the Yuhtunga Jungle.${prompt};
However, take care, as you will not be able to use this tunnel if you wish to return to Norg.${prompt};
Get outta my... Hey wait, you're the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] that helped out Ensetsu a while back. Tell me, how are Ayaya and little Kaede doing these days? ${prompt};
Ah, but enough of this small talk. I heard from my colleagues that these past few months you have been practicing the way of the ninja. If this is true, I'd like to ask you a favor.${prompt};
A few weeks back, a scroll dating back more than twenty years was found. I need your help in deciphering it.${prompt};
What is written on the scroll? Ninjas aren't supposed to ask questions, just follow their orders.;
But to tell you the truth, even I don't have any clue what this scroll could be about.${prompt};
You should probably start off by heading to Bastok and seeing if Kagetora in the Tenshodo has any leads.${prompt};
What?;
You found this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} by following Ensetsu's lead?${prompt};
That weasel is still hiding something. We're going to have to pay our little friend a visit...${prompt};
But you don't have to worry about that.;
Thanks again. Here is a little something for your trouble. Oh, and stay in touch. I may have some more work for you soon.${prompt};
You remember that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} that you brought us? Well, it turned out to be a fake, made fairly recently.${prompt};
But it still looks a helluva lot like the work of the greatest pirate inventor that ever lived--Mitsunari the Poisonclaw.${prompt};
But he left Norg over twenty years ago, and is assumed dead and gone. There have been stories of a pupil of his, but...${prompt};
Argh! But what do I know!? The only person that has anything close to a lead is that weasel, Ensetsu. Go to his house in Bastok and make him tell us all he knows.${prompt};
You're just the person I was looking for. We've got our hands on some new info regarding Mitsunari's treasure.${prompt};
It looks like a pack of those slimy Sahagins stole the Poisonclaw's ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} when our men were transporting it.${prompt};
For the past few days we've been combing the Sea Serpent Grotto, but it's beginning to look like the beasts aren't hiding it anywhere near Norg.${prompt};
But the fish-faced fiends are only beastmen, so you wouldn't think they could take it off Elshimo Island. It's gotta be somewhere close.${prompt};
I'd start with the jungle if I were you. I've got a hunch that the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} is somewhere in there.${prompt};
Well I'll be... You found the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}!${prompt};
Now all we have to do is open it!;
Hmm...but knowing that Mitsunari, there's bound to be some terrible trap on this. We'll have to check it before we open it.${prompt};
Take this to that Leodarion fellow in Rabao. If anyone could open one of the Poisonclaw's traps, it would be him.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Many moons have passed since I made you your first katana. I can see you have grown much in that time.${prompt};
This may seem sudden, but I wish to ask of your assistance.${prompt};
Spoken like a true samurai. Now let me fill you in on the details.;
In the coming weeks, an extremely important ritual will be held. To complete this ritual, a â€œsacred katanaâ€ is needed. I require your assistance in gathering the materials to forge this new blade.${prompt};
The first is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. This is to become the base of the sacred katana. I assume the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you used in your training still rests somewhere in your Mog Safe.${prompt};
The second item I require is ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. You can only find these scales on the beast that lives deep within a crystal pond in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.${prompt};
However, this fish cannot be caught using traditional methods. You must lure it out of hiding using ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, made by the Goblins of that forest.${prompt};
Take care when battling this violent beast, as it is no ordinary fish. After you defeat it, recover ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and bring them back to me.${prompt};
A long journey awaits you. I pray for your safe return.${prompt};
Listen carefully. To forge a new sacred katana, I require two items, the first being the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you used in your training.${prompt};
Return here when you have obtained the materials.${prompt};
I see you have successfully obtained the materials necessary for the forging of the sacred katana. Thanks to your hard work, the blade should be finished by the start of the ritual.${prompt};
Ah yes, your reward. Let me give you this ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. It is one of my finest works. May it guide you on your journey.${prompt};
As I told you before, the materials you brought me will be used to forge a sacred katana to be used in an important ritual being held in a matter of days.${prompt};
However, there is still much preparation to be done. Your assistance may be required again.${prompt};
What is wrong? You do not look too well...${prompt};
I think I know what may be troubling you. You remember my pupil Ranemaud, do you not? Talk with him, and he may be able to help you with your predicament.${prompt};
This is all I will tell you. After you have obtained ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, bring them and your ${item-singular: 0[2]} to me. I will be waiting.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer. How is your training coming along? I can see that you have become quite the samurai.${prompt};
But small talk is not why you have come to me, is it? It is a shame that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has met such a regrettable fate.${prompt};
However, you need not worry. The one place where you can obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is here in Norg.${prompt};
Like a salmon returns to its birthplace to die, all ${item-plural: 0[2]} that are disposed of by their owners make their way back here to Norg. The blade you disposed of is not an exception.${prompt};
I do not know what reasons you had when disposing of your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, but the moment that blade left your possession, it became ours once again.${prompt};
I can return it to you if you wish, but it will cost you. Pay me ${number: 7} gil, and I will give back to you what you once let slip through your hands.${prompt};
The destiny that lies ahead of that ${item-singular: 0[2]} is much more important than you could ever imagine. Take care of it this time.${prompt};
It looks like you are still a little short on gil.${prompt};
Ah, you're back! And just in time, I might say. The date of the ritual is approaching fast.${prompt};
For this next assignment, Gilgamesh specifically requested the assistance of the previous owner of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is unfortunate, but there still is time. Please reconsider your decision.${prompt};
Excellent.;
Now let me show you into Gilgamesh's quarters.${prompt};
Arrrg, if it isn't me matey, ${name-player}. We be mighty grateful fer yer help 'n this one.${prompt};
I'm sure Jauc's already told ya 'bout the upcomin' ritual we be holdin'. We call it â€œYomi Okuri.â€ In Far Eastern legend, Yomi is the name of the place where the spirits of the dead roam.${prompt};
Let me explain...${prompt};
Twenty years ago, before the fall of Castle Zvahl and the Shadow Lord, a small country was wiped off the face of Vana'diel by those bloodthirsty beastmen.${prompt};
That country was known as the Marquisate of Tavnazia. The flag we raise here in Norg be the flag of that lost nation.${prompt};
It was a gruesome battle. Citizens of Tavnazia, soldiers from the three nations... Nearly all were slaughtered in a matter of hours.${prompt};
I, too, saw the apocalypse that happened the day Tavnazia fell.;
When 'twas all over, the handful of us that remained escaped on a tiny ship.${prompt};
But most of me mateys were already in bad shape and didn't survive the long journey home. Only a few of us made it back to Valkurm alive.${prompt};
When we arrived at the dunes, we found that there were others that had tried escapin', but failed...the wreckage of their ships scattered 'bout the beaches.${prompt};
Those who could still move used what remained of their energy to dig simple graves for those that had passed. But this would not be enough to appease the troubled souls that lingered in those sands.${prompt};
Without a guidin' hand, the souls remain in this world, gettin' angrier an' angrier. The Yomi Okuri ritual is held to show these lost spirits the way t'their proper place of restin'.${prompt};
Jauc, you take it from here.${prompt};
Yes, sir.${prompt};
For the Yomi Okuri to be properly carried out, a sacred katana must be made. Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has already been used to forge the blade of the katana. However, we are still one step away from completion.${prompt};
Somewhere on the mainlands is a place called the Labyrinth of Onzozo. In those caves lurks a mammoth bird. To complete the sacred katana, I require ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from that beast.${prompt};
However, this bird rarely ever sets forth from its nest. It must be lured out with a special kind of bait.${prompt};
An' the only one of me mates that can brew a bait fine enough to make that pecker show its beak would be our head cook, Washu. Get some from her before ya leave.${prompt};
Oh, an' watch yer back in those caves. They be crawlin' with all sorts of terrible beasts. Get it, grab the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, and be outta there quick, if ya know what's good fer ya.${prompt};
Do not forget to obtain some of ${color: 5}Washu's tasty wurst${color: 1} before you set off for the Labyrinth of Onzozo. You will need it to lure the giant bird out of its lair.${prompt};
Yes, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is exactly what I need to complete the sacred katana. Now all I require is time...${prompt};
Do not rush me! This job requires extreme concentration. Think of the consequences if I were to hurry through my work!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... That is the name I bestow upon this sacred katana.;
Now, all that remains is for you to take the blade to Valkurm and complete the ritual.${prompt};
It is during this time beyond dusk that you must thrust ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into the secluded beach that lies on the other side of the far western caves in the Valkurm Dunes. Only then will the spirits be set free.${prompt};
From the hour in which the sands are ruled by darkness until they once again are graced by light...${prompt};
Welcome back, ${name-player}.;
The new form that blade has taken is the proof that you were successful in your mission. I applaud you on your bravery.${prompt};
Gilgamesh has asked me to present you with this as a token of our appreciation. Wear it with pride and let it guide you on your path in life.${prompt};
Norg has many ties with the lost nation of Tavnazia, and many people here still think of it as their homeland.;
The battle fought twenty years ago took the lives of many of our brothers, but the sacrifices that they made have not been in vain.${prompt};
That day, something in Gilgamesh changed. He transformed from a simple soldier to a great leader who would bring us together and create the Norg of today.${prompt};
So you're the adventurer that Gilgamesh sent, eh? Get out a piece of paper and a pencil. You're going to have to go fetch me the following four items.${prompt};
What? You thought I'd have everything you need here? With the way these hooligans eat, I barely have enough grub to feed the dogs!;
Oh, don't worry. The way you adventurers put everything up on auction, you should be able to get your hands on these items easy enough.${prompt};
All I need is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
When you've got all four, bring them to me. I'll whip you up your bait in no time.${prompt};
What, did you forget what I need you to bring already? And you call yourself an adventurer!${prompt};
Well, that was quick. Pretty good for an adventurer. There may be some hope for you yet! Ha ha ha!${prompt};
Now, let me whip up your bird bait, just like I promised.${prompt};
Here you go.;
Be careful, though. From what I hear, that Onzozo place is a lot rougher than our jungles.${prompt};
Why are you still here? You've got to get my bait to the birdy before it goes bad. If you were a monster, would you settle for a spoiled meal?${prompt};
${name-player}! Once again, trouble is brewing in Norg, and we require your services.${prompt};
I see. So you are busy...;
However, there is still time. I pray that you will return to us quickly.${prompt};
Your gratitude is appreciated by all of us here in Norg. Now let us proceed to Gilgamesh's chambers.${prompt};
Arrrg, welcome back, ${name-player}.;
Let me fill ya in on the predicament we've got ourselves into.${prompt};
A thief's robbed us of one of our treasures.;
Me thinks it be another band o'pirates. I've got me men out on the trail of 'em now.${prompt};
Ya may think that problems between pirates should be solved by pirates--and yer right. But this time, the situation's a wee bit more complicated.${prompt};
The item the thief stole was an ancient helmet left by me ancestors called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. But this ain't no ordinary helmet.${prompt};
It's said that me father trapped the spirit of an evil demon in that helmet after a grueling battle in the Northlands. He put numerous magical seals on it t'keep the beast at bay.${prompt};
This probably be the reason that our rival pirates decided t'lay their grimy hands on it.${prompt};
T'make a long story short, I need ya t'find the man that had the nerve t'rob me, and get that helmet back. Not too difficult fer an adventurer like you, eh?${prompt};
And if fer some reason, the magic seal on the helmet were to be broken, we'll need ya t'...well, ya know what we'll need ya t'do then.${prompt};
Because of the sensitive nature of this problem, not many here in Norg have been informed of what has happened. However, the men I have sent to track down the thieves should have some good information fer ya, but first ya have t'search them out.${prompt};
Currently, Gilgamesh has men combing Vana'diel for clues on the whereabouts of the thieves. Search them out and learn what new information they have gathered.${prompt};
The situation has grown graver than I had imagined. It is only a matter of time before the seal on the helmet breaks, if it has not already.${prompt};
Take this. It can be used to extinguish the evil spirit's power for a short period of time.${prompt};
Throw that ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the magic portal. After that, you should then be able to enter. But beware of what lurks on the other side!${prompt};
You fool! How could you just dispose of such an important item? Without it, how are you supposed to break the cursed seal on the portal!?${prompt};
By the looks of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, I can guess that seal was already broken when you arrived at the shrine. It is amazing that the seal held for so many decades.${prompt};
You have done well, ${name-player}. Without your strength and perseverance, we would not have been able to silence that evil spirit. We are all in your debt.${prompt};
However, before I give you your reward, there is one more small task that I wish of you.;
It would be an abomination to leave the helmet in this damaged state. We must do something to repair it.${prompt};
Hmmm... We have most of the material required to repair it here in Norg, but I fear we may not have enough ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Bring me one ${item-singular: 1[2]}. I am sure you know of a craftsman who can provide you with this material. I will proceed in repairing the helmet when you have brought it to me.${prompt};
The helmet is in terrible condition. However, I think that with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I may be able to repair it.${prompt};
Yes, this is what I require to repair the damaged helmet. I will get to work immediately. However, this may take a great deal of time. Its condition is far worse than I had imagined.${prompt};
Why must you rush me in my work!? As I told you, the helmet was in terrible condition when you brought it to me. My work must be precise if I am to return it to its former glory!${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. I have just finished the repairs to the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. I had to replace a large part of the helmet, but I feel I have helped it retain its former luster.${prompt};
Yes, your reward. I have not forgotten.;
Let us discuss these matters in Gilgamesh's quarters.${prompt};
Arrrg, I'm sorry fer gettin' ya caught up in our pirate affairs, but I be mighty glad t'see ya back here safe in Norrrg.${prompt};
You have me thanks fer all ya done for us.${prompt};
If it weren't fer ya, we'd still be fearin' the day that demon would rear its ugly head 'n eat us all. But now that the demon's gone, that just leaves a pretty helmet t'sit on me wall.${prompt};
But what good is a helmet without a head t'wear it!? This ${item-singular: 0[2]} would do you more good than it would collectin' dust in me chambers. Take it! You've earned it!${prompt};
I am still taken back by how much you've matured much since I forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]} many moons ago. I can only imagine what great things lie before such a skilled warrior.${prompt};
So, you've decided to help!${prompt};
So, you've finally decided to help.${prompt};

Arrrg, so ya say ya couldn't journey deeper into the temple because a grate was blockin' yer way?${prompt};
What? Ya saw a stairway on the other side of that bloomin' grate? Ha! Leave it t'the Zilart t'build somethin' crazy like that.${prompt};
But this ain't no time fer complainin'. We've got t'figger out a way t'get t'that stairway.${prompt};
There's got t'be some way t'open that wall. Some kind of key...${prompt};
Arrrg! I've got it!;
Ya say the Zilarrrt used crystals t'power their strange machines, right? Then maybe...${prompt};
I think me may know the way t'get through that grate.${prompt};
Listen up, ${name-player}. I want ya t'find a Mithra named Mary or Maroo or somethin' like that. She was in Norg a while back, but now she could be anywhere on the mainlands.${prompt};
Why all this trouble over a cat? Well, when that lady was here, she tried sellin' us a strange crystal she said she found in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.${prompt};
I don't think she was tryin' t'pull a fast one, but no one was interested in her booty, so she packed up and left fer somewhere else.${prompt};
But now that me thinks of it, that crystal she found in Zi'Tah may be jus' what we're lookin' fer.${prompt};

##### ZM11 #####

A thief like her won't be easy t'find. I'll have me mateys around Vana'diel spread the word that yer lookin' fer a crystal like the one she has.${prompt};
If she gets wind of that info, that Maree's likely t'settle down until ya find her. We can only pray that what she has is what we need.${prompt};
Arrrg, so that be the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that we've been searchin' fer. It looks like you had a hell of a time tryin' t'get yer hands on it.${prompt};
But the real hell is yet t'come, ${name-player}. Crystal Warriors...floating islands... It may all seem crazy, but don't let that get in yer way. Yer Vana'diel's only hope.${prompt};

##### ZM15 début ######

Arrrg, so were ya able t'make it t'Tu'Lia?${prompt};
Oh, so ya made them Crystal Warriors walk the plank now, did ya? Then that jus' leaves us with that wee prince. But first, we've got t'find a way into the darn shrine.${prompt};
Is it Eald'narrrche that's keepin' us out, or is it somethin' else?${prompt};
Listen close, ${name-player}.${prompt};
If the prince had already opened the Gate of the Gods, Vana'diel wouldn't be here anymore. But as you can see, nothin's changed so far.${prompt};
Which means all we can do is wait. When Eald'narche makes his move...that's when we attack!${prompt};
You'n me both hate the Zilarrrt makin' fools out of us, but there's nothing much we can do right now.${prompt};

##### ZM15: fin ########

We can't know when Eald'narche will attempt t'open the gate. It could be t'morrow, fer all I know. If ya have any preparations, I'd suggest makin' 'em now.${prompt};
Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]. You look like you could use some extra cash, and what easier way to get gil than by making a date with Lady Luck?${prompt};
Give â€œLucky Rollâ€ a try?;
${selection-lines};
Luck be a lady tonight!;
I'm not throwing my money away!;
Fill me in on the details.${prompt};
Let me explain to you how it works. One game of Lucky Roll is played each Vana'diel day.${prompt};
One play is 100 gil, but as long as you keep paying, you can keep playing.${prompt};
For each 100 gil, you get one roll of our six-sided die. The number that appears is added to the running total for that day.${prompt};
The lucky adventurer who rolls the die that gets the running total over 400 wins...get this...a whopping 10000 gil!${prompt};
And that's not all! You'll receive extra prizes if the total comes to 401 or 402, and a super bonus prize if your roll brings the total to exactly 400!${prompt};
"But be careful; the only time you can find out the running total is after you have rolled.${prompt}";
And that's it! Pretty simple, huh?;
You can attack from the get go, or you can sit back while other people roll, and then come in for the final kill. We provide you with the die, you choose the strategy.${prompt};
Alright, enough talk, let's get rolling!${prompt};
You rolled a...${number: 1}!;
The running total is now ${number: 3}!${prompt};
Congratulations! Lady Luck has smiled on you today! Here's your 10000 gil!${prompt};
And because your roll put the running total at exactly 400, you receive a bonus prize!${prompt};
And for bringing the total so close to 400, here is your extra prize!${prompt};
I'm sorry, but that's it for today's game of Lucky Roll. Come by tomorrow, and maybe Lady Luck will be waiting for you!${prompt};

Arrrg, I see you made it back safe 'n sound.${prompt};
Yer story won't be goin' down in the annals of history, but there are some things that best go unknown.${prompt};
Though if it wasn't fer you, we'd all be sleepin' down in Davy Jones's locker. Ya have me thanks, matey.${prompt};
As fer Lion... Aldo came and gave me all the details on what she did.${prompt};
What was she thinkin', goin' off and gettin' herself killed before her own father...${prompt};
She washed up on shore here when she was still just a wee lass. Nobody knew where she came from...${prompt};
But that wasn't uncommon during the Great War. Many a life was torn apart back then.${prompt};
And when me father told me I was t'take care of her...well, I can tell ya, I wasn't ready fer that.${prompt};
But raisin' Lion taught me a lot about the world. If it wasn't fer her, I wouldn't be the man I be today.${prompt};
I never knew what she thought about her father bein' a pirate...${prompt};
But I can tell you one thing--I be mighty damn proud to have her as a daughter.${prompt};

#### ZM17: fin ##########

Arrrg, the Zilarrrt's dream of Paradise may be over, but that doesn't change the fact that them beastmen still be crawlin' over the face of Vana'diel.${prompt};
When ya think about it, this little charade with the princes may've just been the tip of the blimey iceberg.${prompt};
And Lion... I haven't told the other scallywags what really happened t'her. They all think she's off on some adventure...${prompt};
It's always easier t'forget about the things that trouble ya. That be why people always forget those who pass away. I don't want that happenin' t'me daughter. That's why she'll always be alive here in Norg.${prompt};
${name-player}, I can sense your skills have improved much since you first wielded the ${color: 5}mumeito${color: 1} I forged for you many moons ago. However, you still have many malms to travel on the road to mastery of the great katana. Do you feel you have what it takes to complete your journey?${prompt};
I understand your reluctance. One need not be hasty in such important decisions. I know that you will return here when you sense that you are ready.${prompt};
I detect no hesitation in your mind and spirit. That is good.${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and wield it as if it were part of your own body. When you have proven your strength and ability, the blade will lose its power. Then you will know that it has accepted you.${prompt};
When you feel that this time has come, return here with the katana.${prompt};
This test will try you in many ways, physically and mentally. However, I am certain that you will be able to clear the mountain that looms before you.${prompt};
When you have proven your strength and ability, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will lose its power. Then you will know that it has accepted you.${prompt};
What brings you here today?${prompt};
I still sense much potential inside you. This trial is designed to bring forth that potential so you may further refine it and utilize it to its fullest.${prompt};
Wait. You need say no more. I realize that I failed to emphasize the rarity of that blade, but I did not imagine that you would lose such an important item.${prompt};
However, there is no need to fear. I have another ${item-singular: 0[2]} that I can lend you, though you must start the trial once again from the beginning.;
And this time, be more careful. I will not tolerate any more mistakes.${prompt};
What is this I hear? You are not truly thinking of abandoning your journey, are you?${prompt};
I see that you have made up your mind...;
I was certain that you had the potential to face the hardships I presented you, but I guess even an experienced eye such as my own can sometimes be clouded.${prompt};
I am sure that you have your reasons for this decision and I will not stop you from what you have decided in your heart. You may now return the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} that I entrusted to you.${prompt};
I will leave you with the disposal of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. It has already lost its power and is no longer of any use to me.${prompt};
You accepted this quest with the intention of completing it, did you not? If you have the time to be playing tricks on a feeble, old man, you should be out on the battlefield improving your techniques!${prompt};
I can still feel energy running through this blade. This can only mean one thing--it still has not accepted your ability. The road to mastery is long. One cannot expect to reach one's goal in such a short period of time.${prompt};
Wonderful! You are now ready for the final portion of your journey. Travel to the place inscribed upon this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}--the Kuftal Tunnel. There you will meet your final test.${prompt};
Travel to the Kuftal Tunnel, as is instructed upon the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I gave you. There you will realize what you are to do.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! So, you have finally completed this leg of your journey...;
You are now ready to begin anew with your new techniques.${prompt};
You have learned the weapon skill â€œTachi: Kashaâ€!${prompt};
Well, look at you. I'm glad to see you realize that being a ninja isn't all about casting spells and throwing stars. But there's still one technique that's left for only the best of the best.${prompt};
You've learned to wield your katana by risking your life and limb out there on the battlefield.${prompt};
Learning this final technique will be no different. You'll have to get out there in the jungle and bust your butt like you never have before. Do you think you've got what it takes?${prompt};
Hah! You may be shaking your head now, but I know your type. You won't be satisfied until you reach the top. You'll be back...and I'll be waiting.${prompt};
I knew that you couldn't resist the challenge, but saying you're going to do something is a helluva lot easier than actually going out and doing it. If you don't think you're going to succeed, then you shouldn't even bother trying in the first place!${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Use that katana to deal as much damage as possible. When you've acquired enough skill, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will recognize your power and its power will fade.${prompt};
When that happens, bring her back here to me.${prompt};
But don't think that's the end of your trial. Something much more exciting will be waiting for you when you get back, if you know what I mean. Heh heh heh.${prompt};
When you've acquired enough skill, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will recognize your might and then its power will fade.${prompt};
What the hell do you want? You're not done already, are you?${prompt};
Well, if that's all, then get the hell out of this cave and back out there on the battlefield!${prompt};
You lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt};
Idiot! You had the perfect chance to learn a deadly new technique, and you've thrown it away! I've seen crabs with more brains than you. Get out of my face!${prompt};
Ha ha ha. I had you going there, didn't I? While I won't commend you on your stupidity, I will give you one more chance. But you screw up again and I'll...${prompt};
Quit? Did you whack your head on the grotto ceiling when you came in? You're not really thinking of giving up now, are you?${prompt};
Unbelievable. I thought that you had more in you than that...;
Well, you can hand me back the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I gave you.${prompt};
As for that ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it's nothing but a piece of junk now. Sell it, throw it away, I could give a damn what you do with it.${prompt};
If that was supposed to be funny, then don't go quitting your day job.;
This isn't a game, ${name-player}. Now get back to your training!${prompt};
Don't tell me you think that you've trained enough. Get your feet out of your ears and take a closer listen to the blade. It'll tell you when it's time to come back.${prompt};
Well, it's about time.;
I never had any doubt in you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and head for the Labyrinth of Onzozo.;
It won't be a cakewalk, but I bet you already knew that.${prompt};
Don't make me repeat myself! You know what you have to do down there in the Labyrinth of Onzozo. Now get off your butt and do it!${prompt};
Well, what do you know! If you could whip that monster, you should have no problem using any of the deadly katana techniques. I'd take off my hat to you...if I wore one. Ha ha ha.${prompt};
You have learned the weapon skill â€œBlade: Kuâ€!${prompt};
Accept the challenge?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
Not just yet.${prompt};
Why are you here?;
${selection-lines};
No particular reason.;
I've lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
I want to quit this quest.${prompt};
Do you really want to quit?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You obtain the weapon ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the key item ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};

What an exhilarating feeling!${prompt};
Ah yes, there is one more thing...${prompt};
Eh? What?${prompt};
Oh.;
You must be this one's new owner.${prompt};
With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.${prompt};
Treat her well...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Splendid!;
From this day forth, I belong to you.${prompt};
So, what kind of games shall we play?;
And where shall we go to play them?;
Who are we going to kill when we get there?;
It's all just too exciting...!${prompt};
...;
Thou hast found me.${prompt};
I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.${prompt};
A moment...${prompt};
...;
What has happened to me?${prompt};
I see, you are the sword's new owner?${prompt};
Well, this is most encouraging!;
A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it.;
It is yours...;
Restore order to Vana'diel!${prompt};
And now I, too, can rest unburdened...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Thou art blessed this day.${prompt};
Henceforth, I shall be thy blade.;
For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...${prompt};
...;
You have found me.${prompt};
Allow me to show my respect.;
You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.${prompt};
But first...${prompt};
Who are you?${prompt};
This must be some sort of joke.;
You are the new wielder of this weapon?${prompt};
Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you.;
With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.${prompt};
However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.${prompt};
Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind.;
My regards go with you, stranger...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Now, my heroic master...${prompt};
For what purpose will you wield my power?;
The choices before you are without limit.;
Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...${prompt};
...;
You...me, meet.${prompt};
Me...free...;
Thanks to you. Me, your...${prompt};
Wait...${prompt};
What the...?${prompt};
Ah, now I see.;
The wheel has turned.${prompt};
Truthfully spoken, I am thankful.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.${prompt};
I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.${prompt};
You have my gratitude.;
You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...${prompt};
...${prompt};
You, master, me.;
Good, work. Me, thank, you.${prompt};
Master, me, hunger.;
Go, hunt? Find, prey?;
Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood.;
Master, me, hunger...${prompt};
...;
Ah, you found me!${prompt};
I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart.;
I am truly grateful.${prompt};
One moment...${prompt};
...;
This is...Jeuno!?;
Have I finally returned?${prompt};
I... Nobody can see me.;
This is merely a reflection of reality.;
Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.${prompt};
Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?${prompt};
Congratulations.;
I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards.;
I also ask that someday you use ${item-singular: 0[2]} to avenge the Hydra Corps...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I congratulate you also...my new master.${prompt};
Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight!;
Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!${prompt};
...;
You have found me.${prompt};
My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.${prompt};
You have but to gain her respect...${prompt};
Such a long dream I was having...${prompt};
It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world.;
No. I must accept that it was no dream.${prompt};
And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did...;
It seems you have already found your way to ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Very well, I will pass it on to you.;
But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.${prompt};
And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Heh. Heh heh.;
Hahahahahahaha!${prompt};
Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power?;
There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...${prompt};
...;
You have unearthed me at last.${prompt};
I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.${prompt};
All that remains is...${prompt};
Hello?;
Is it possible that I...${prompt};
But, no.;
I have not returned to this realm...;
You. You are to be my successor?${prompt};
You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince ${item-singular: 0[2]} to lend you its power, at any rate.${prompt};
Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.${prompt};
Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used.;
You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...${prompt};
...${prompt};
The ceremony of inheritance is complete.${prompt};
It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...${prompt};
...;
I have been rediscovered at last.${prompt};
Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.${prompt};
You must now gain the sanction of my master...${prompt};
It is a pity, indeed.${prompt};
This day has come far too soon for my liking.${prompt};
However, you are a master of the ninja trade.;
I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Take this blade as your own.;
Travel far down the path of the ninja.${prompt};
I will be watching you from the shadows...${prompt};
...${prompt};
A fine master...${prompt};
My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...${prompt};
...;
This day has finally come.${prompt};
I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.;
Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?${prompt};
In any event...${prompt};
What is going on here?${prompt};
Ah, my successor has come.${prompt};
I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt};
When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.${prompt};
You have my gratitude.;
Farewell, ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
...${prompt};
It has been a hard path to reach this point.${prompt};
But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun.;
You have yet to attain perfection.;
Let us continue your training...${prompt};
...;
At long last, you have arrived.${prompt};
I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...${prompt};
You have proven me wrong...${prompt};
I have heard of your coming.${prompt};
You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt};
Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.;
I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt};
However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.;
If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt};
Now, take the hammer and go!;
Just be careful with how you handle it.;
Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt};
...${prompt};
My might is yours to wield.${prompt};
Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt};
...;
So, you have found me.${prompt};
I must give you my thanks.;
I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt};
And now...${prompt};
Hwaah!${prompt};
Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt};
Well, it's for the best, I suppose.;
In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt};
I entrust this staff to you!;
Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt};
I take my leave of you now.;
I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I am yours to wield.${prompt};
But you are not yet my master.;
By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...${prompt};
...;
You have discovered my resting place.${prompt};
The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.;
My thanks.${prompt};
Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt};
Where is this place?${prompt};
Of course. How could I forget.;
I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt};
Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.;
${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt};
However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.;
You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt};
Farewell...${prompt};
...${prompt};
It is an honor to be owned by a just master.;
Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt};
You are now the one to draw me in battle.;
I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt};
...;
We finally meet.${prompt};
I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt};
But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt};
Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.;
Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt};
Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt};
You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt};
Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt};
This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt};
...${prompt};
A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt};
Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt};
...;
I am saved.${prompt};
Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt};
A few more moments, if you please...${prompt};
Hello there.;
I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt};
You've never heard of me?;
Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt};
To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt};
But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt};
She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt};
...${prompt};
He was a wonderful performer.${prompt};
Let us be on our way.;
Our tour of the world has only just begun...${prompt};
You wanna talk to old Kamui?;
He doesn't have time to swap fishin' tales with every adventurer that wanders in from the jungle. Take a number, buddy.${prompt};
You wanna talk with old Kamui?;
I've got orders that he's not to be disturbed.;
Come back some other time.${prompt};
How'd you know to bring somethin' like this?;
Old Kamui just loves spicy foods.${prompt};
Wait here.;
I'll go get him for you.${prompt};
${name-player}, good vork on obtaining the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and the other foods.${prompt};
I vill listen to vhat this Kamui has to say along vith you.${prompt};
Sorry to keep you waiting.;
I was informed you brought me some tasty gifts.${prompt};
How did you come by these items? You must be involved in the Tavnazian affairs that Gilgamesh mentioned.${prompt};
In which case, I will give you my full cooperation.;
Tavnazia is my homeland. We lived in the Marquisate when Lugalbanda was our leader.${prompt};
You are from Tavnazia?;
Ve have come here from Kazham after consulting vith the former chieftainness, Romaa Mihgo.${prompt};
Ve vish to hear the tale about a glowing box.;
The chieftainness said that you mightaru know of such a story.${prompt};
You speak of the treasure of Tavnazia--the â€œbaptismal vesselâ€?${prompt};
Do you, too, seek the power of the magicite...?${prompt};
Magicite?;
No, ve did not come to ask about that cursed-vursed rock.${prompt};
Ve are looking for a crystal of darkness said to lie somevhere in the Northlands.;
Do you know anything of this legend?${prompt};
A crystal of darkness...;
This must be related to the tale of a soldier who found the baptismal vessel in those frozen lands.${prompt};
The story takes place in the time when King Ranperre ruled the Kingdom of San d'Oria...${prompt};
A horde of Orcs once sailed from the northern continent to attempt a landing on Quon.${prompt};
The Uleguerand Range, north of Xarcabard, would become the staging point for the Orcish campaign.${prompt};
To halt this invasion, the Tavnazian navy took to the seas while King Ranperre led an army overland...${prompt};
The snowy plains ran red with uncounted bloody skirmishes fought in the defense of Quon.${prompt};
In the midst of the vicious battle, a San d'Orian soldier slipped and fell into a crevasse.${prompt};
As he wandered in search of an exit from the winding tunnels, the soldier noticed an ephemeral voice calling to him.${prompt};
The soldier began walking in the direction of the voice, and eventually stumbled upon an unexpected sight. Right before him lay a frozen lake, glowing with an eerie light...${prompt};
And then vhat happened?${prompt};
It is said that the soldier was addressed by the voice of a god, but none know of the words that passed between them.${prompt};
The story ends with the soldier returning from the Northlands bearing a mysterious box. This box was to become a holy relic of the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt};
A frozen lake in the Uleguerand Range, beyond the land of Xarcabard...${prompt};
Now that I think about it, thirty years ago there was a Mithra who went in search of the lake after hearing this tale.;
She was unsuccessful.${prompt};
Apparently she joined an allied expedition for her journey to the Northlands...${prompt};
Yow Rabntah vas looking for the frozen lake!?${prompt};
Yes, but her experiences in that evil land twisted her soul.${prompt};
Her return to Kazham sparked an intertribal conflict that cost many Mithra their lives.${prompt};
After this incident, Romaa Mihgo became chieftainness, and her rule caused other problems between Kazham and Norg.;
But looking back, that was probably unavoidable.${prompt};
Ah, I've veered from our original discussion.${prompt};
No, not at all.;
This has been mostaru informative, thank you.${prompt};
According to Kamui's story, Yow Rabntah joined the allied expedition of her own free vill.${prompt};
Vas Romaa Mihgo not avare of this fact?${prompt};
Hmm.;
The Uleguerand Range is not a place to visitaru lightly.${prompt};
Let us call upon the Rhinostery adventurers in the Northlands for help!${prompt};
${name-player}, meet me at the tower on the Beaucedine Glacier vhere my Rhinostery peers are located.;
Until then!${prompt};
That Tarutaru you came with, he's an adventurer for the Rhinostery, right?${prompt};
He said somethin' about visiting a tower in Beaucedine.;
If they're lookin' to research the treasure that's supposed to be there, they're wastin' their time. It was stolen and sold off years ago.${prompt};
mes1${prompt};
Hey, look, it's a stinkin' adventurer!${prompt};
We're busy toastin' the end of a hard day's work, so why don't ya buzz off someplace?${prompt};
I bet ya never seen the likes o' this brew, have ya?${prompt};
This drop, matey, can only be found in the mysterious lands o' the Far East.${prompt};
Listen here, ${choice: 0}[lass/landlubber].;
We pirates got a powerful hate for so-called â€œheroesâ€ like you.${prompt};
Anyone who's never braved the high seas fer battle and booty is still just a whimpering puppy to a pirate.${prompt};
Oho, so's ya got something to say about that, have ya?;
A challenge, then. If ya can bring a treasure ta brighten a pirate's jaded eye, then ya might find a seat at our table.${prompt};
Arrgh, not that we're expectin' much from a whelp like you!${prompt};
Sohyon used to have one of them talkin' birds that perched on his shoulder.;
Maybe ya could get us one of those?${prompt};
Or maybe ya could grow yerself a bushy red beard.;
That'd impress me.${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
That might be askin' a bit too much, eh?${prompt};
I tell ya what.;
If ya can bring a drink that warms me pirate's soul, I'll give ya one of whatever there is to be found in Norg.${prompt};
Arrgh, now there's a deal!${prompt};
How about introducin' him to that young lass that wandered in a little while back?${prompt};
Hold on there, ya mangy backstabber!;
I had me eye on that one!${prompt};
How about introducin' her to one o' the pair that wandered in a little while back?${prompt};
Yeah, that ought to keep her outta our hair.${prompt};
Just remember, I saw the other one first.${prompt};
Enough blathering, ya scurvy dogs.;
Ya know what ya have ta do, adventurer.${prompt};
I'll be waitin' right here with me empty cup.;
Heh-heh-heh.${prompt};
Sohyon's drunk pretty much all there is to drink.;
Good luck findin' somethin' to satisfy 'im.${prompt};
Arrgh, let's see what yer made of, adventurer.${prompt};
Me cup's still empty, adventurer.${prompt};
Those boys ain't gonna be satisfied, no matter what you bring.;
Yer better off just goin' on yer way.${prompt};
Here, take this flask.${prompt};
Fill it from the four big clams in the Korroloka Tunnel.;
We'll see who has the last laugh...${prompt};
Good work. Now hand it over to Sohyon.${prompt};
Arrgh, ya kept me waitin' fer long enough.;
Here's ta ya health!${prompt};
Urgh!;
This is plain water! What kinda dirty trick are ya tryin' ta pull?${prompt};
You've poured so many liquids down your throat, you probably can't tell a fine beverage from barrel swill anymore.${prompt};
Wash your mouth out with that and give yourself a break for a while!${prompt};
Are ya tryin' to tell me how ta drink?;
I don't need yer stinkin' advice!${prompt};
Your tongue must be rotten, Sohyon.${prompt};
That liquid is the most refreshing, revitalizing water in Vana'diel.${prompt};
It comes from the giant clams in the Korroloka Tunnel. If you spent a moment savoring the taste, you'd realize it's more than just ordinary water.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Well, I guess ya kept yer end of the bargain.${prompt};
Take this key to Gimb, the Galka who stands near the entry gate. He'll take care o' ya.${prompt};
Get outta here.;
I got no time fer scabby adventurers.${prompt};
Yer here to meet the ${choice: 0}[lad/lass] from the couple that blew in a while back?${prompt};
Hang around here a bit.${prompt};
Hmmm.;
I can't find the girl.;
Where could she have gone?${prompt};
Thank you for coming!;
You're a life saver, kupopo!${prompt};
Just a moment, now.;
Where's that dreamy-looking girl got to?${prompt};
Sanctia? Oh, she left ages and ages ago, kupopo.${prompt};
I gave her some ${item-plural: 1[2]} and she let me have her dinner, kupopo.${prompt};
Sanctia dreams of becoming a fearsome bounty hunter, kupopo!${prompt};
Hold on there, buddy.;
Does she really mean to find Goldmane, the legendary bounty hunter?${prompt};
He's the guy that collared the infamous Atarefaunet.${prompt};
I heard he scored a mountain of gil for that job, but the rest of Atarefaunet's Band is still thirsting for his blood.${prompt};
The rumors say Goldmane went into hiding after the gang came after him.${prompt};
Yeah, and if he's still breathing, it means those vicious thugs haven't found him yet.${prompt};
A guy who can give that lot the runaround is never gonna be found by a clueless puppy like Sanctia.${prompt};
And if her search for Goldmane becomes noticeable, it will draw the attention of Atarefaunet's Band.${prompt};
The idea was to make her cool her heels in Norg for a while, and then have Gilgamesh explain the big holes in her plan.${prompt};
But this is terrible, kupopo!${prompt};
Sanctia said she was going to Bastok, kupopo!${prompt};
Don't tell me she stowed away on the ship headed for Bastok?${prompt};
Captain Chieka is known among pirates as the â€œShe-Devil of the Sea.â€${prompt};
If Chieka finds her, Sanctia'll be tossed into the ocean for sure.${prompt};
We can't let that happen, kupopo!${prompt};
Wha-! Dammit!;
There goes the other one!${prompt};
Jus' seein' yer ugly mug makes me brew go sour.;
Ya done what ya come to do, now clear off!${prompt};
Even Sohyon can't win against the likes o' Washu.;
They didn't put her in charge o' Norg's galley fer nothing.${prompt};
Getting on Washu's bad side is more trouble than it's worth.;
You'd do well to remember that, adventurer.${prompt};
Where could 'e be...?;
Knowing him, 'e should be...${prompt};
Oh, sorry there. Just talkin' to meself.${prompt};
......${prompt};
That rat...;
Where could he 'ave gotten off to...?${prompt};
I've got me a bad feeling about this...;
It brings back unpleasant memories, it does...${prompt};
...Eh? You say you're an adventurer, do ya?;
Say, could I take a bit o' your time?;
I've got me a slight problem, you see.${prompt};
My mate Gubokka's gone down by 'imself to the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt};
We've always capered around that place like a blinkin' playground, so he shouldn't be gettin' himself lost.${prompt};
I haven't seen the little git's face once since his decidin' t' set off.${prompt};
Lately the people of Norg're up in arms due to all the monsters showin' up in the grotto.${prompt};
I told that nitwit Gubokka t' be careful, but still...${prompt};
I wanna go and check on the poor runt, but goin' alone into that monster-infested hole is just askin' for more trouble.${prompt};
That's where you come in.;
Think ya could go t' Sea Serpent Grotto and find Gubokka for me?${prompt};
I really need yer 'elp.${prompt};
You'll do it!?;
Why, thank ya! O' course, you'll be rewarded as handsomely as I can do for ya.${prompt};
Anyway, just keep a sharp eye out down there.;
I'd be in a real pickle if I lost the both of ya t' some grim fate.${prompt};
I've heard the monsters out there are no laughin' matter, so please be takin' care of yerself.${prompt};
...<pant>...<gasp>...;
...I...I'm...safe...?${prompt};
...<pant>...<wheeze>...whew.${prompt};
Gubokka!!!${prompt};
Stray Cloud!;
I...I'm sorry. I...${prompt};
Bloody hell! You okay!?;
What in blazes happened out there? Can ya speak?${prompt};
...I...I'm fine.;
<gasp>...<pant>...${prompt};
Stray Cloud...I'm sure you know how everyone's worried about the beasts that have been appearing in the grotto lately...${prompt};
I thought I could do something about it... That's why I left. I wanted to defeat the monsters for the people of Norg.${prompt};
But I ended up lost in the caves that I'd walked through for years. Pathetic, I know.${prompt};
Swallowing my pride, I turned back and desperately began my search for the way home...${prompt};
...That was when it happened.${prompt};
All of a sudden, a monster jumped out from the shadows and began attacking me.${prompt};
It was unbelievably powerful. I knew I was no match for it.${prompt};
Next thing I knew, my legs had grown numb with fright...${prompt};
Suddenly, he had me cornered...${prompt};
My life began flashing before my eyes. I knew I was going to die.${prompt};
Just as I was regretting my decision to travel alone, a Hume warrior leapt out of nowhere and...saved me.${prompt};
You all right there!?;
Leave this brute to me!${prompt};
Come and get it, you bastard!;
Ahhhh!!!${prompt};
...Ahh...!!!${prompt};
I was so afraid, I deserted the Hume who had saved me.;
I...came back alone, thinking only of my own skin.${prompt};
W-wha'...!?;
So th' Hume's still out there?${prompt};
I don't know.;
I really hope he's okay, but considering the strength of that monster, I just don't know...${prompt};
What a bloody mess...${prompt};
I just...just wanted to help people.;
I couldn't have dreamed that this would happen...${prompt};
Ya know, Gubokka, thinkin' o' others is very noble.;
There's no denyin' that. But you just gotta stop pushin' it!${prompt};
Long ago, I had a good friend.;
He always blathered on about do-gooding and such, and to what did i' lead 'im? To a meaningless death, that's what!${prompt};
I couldn't stand losin' me another friend that way.${prompt};
Stray Cloud...${prompt};
Don't ge' any more rarab-brained ideas about goin' off alone.;
That's all I wanna say t' ya.${prompt};
Still, I'm worried about tha' Hume warrior...${prompt};
If he's killed because I was too cowardly to help him...${prompt};
...;
I'm sorry, but I have to go back and help him!;
He might die if I don't!${prompt};
You git! Don't make me repeat myself!;
What can you blinkin' do out there alone?;
Just shut the 'ell up!${prompt};
B-but...${prompt};
Hey adventurer, you look like you've been through a battle or two.;
Since you didn't ge' a chance to look for Gubokka, could ya look for tha' Hume instead?${prompt};
I want ya t' go t' Sea Serpent Grotto with Gubokka and make sure he's safe!${prompt};
I'll be waitin' here for ya.;
O' course, you'll ge' a nice li'l reward.;
Jus' don't push yourself too hard.${prompt};
I leave Gubokka in your hands.;
I wonder if tha' Hume warrior is safe...?${prompt};
So that's what 'appened...;
Wha' an unfortunate loss...${prompt};
If only I had more power...;
I could have saved him!${prompt};
You can keep feelin' sorry for yourself if ya think it'll solve anything.;
But the proper thing for ya t' be doin' now is givin' the man a proper funeral.;
...What's that you've go' there?${prompt};
This is the sword that the Hume warrior held...;
His final wish was that it be buried with his bones.${prompt};
Th-that sword...!${prompt};
I guess I can't be stoppin' ya now, can I?${prompt};
I have to go.;
I can use my strength for the good of others in Vana'diel.;
I've already made my decision.${prompt};
Heh... Is tha' so?;
Alrigh' then. I won't get in yer way.;
Hey, take this sword with ya. I'll let ya borrow it.${prompt};
Ohhh...really!?;
But isn't this sword important to you?${prompt};
Nah...it's fine.;
In exchange, you've gotta promise me somethin'.${prompt};
That sword is bloody powerful, so when you're helping the poor people o' Vana'diel, make good use of it!;
I'm sure you'll get t' use it for a good cause someday!${prompt};
Haha! That sounds like something you would say, putting me on the spot!;
But I hear you. I will keep the promise.${prompt};
And when I've fulfilled the promise, I'll come back and return the sword! Mark my word!${prompt};
I'll be waiting!;
But do ya think you'll really remember?;
Your memory's so bad, I'm surprised ya still know my name!${prompt};
Son of a Quadav...!;
With friends like you, who needs enemies!?${prompt};
Hahahahaha!!!${prompt};
Hahahahaha!!!${prompt};
But Gomoya never came t' return the sword...${prompt};
I can't believe it...;
Gomoya... For that Hume warrior, he...${prompt};
It...it can't be...;
Stray Cloud... The friend you were talking about...${prompt};
Heh. That nitwit Gomoya...;
He kept 'is promise...our promise...${prompt};
Ah...the lunkhead, making me eyes water!${prompt};
But, he's no longer...;
Gomoya is already...;
It looks like this is gonna be a long night...${prompt};
You 'elped me out a considerable lot.;
Here's your reward. Thanks be to ya.${prompt};
I was able to ge' closure with Gomoya, and it's all thanks t' you.;
I just wanna tell ya how much I appreciate it.${prompt};
Arrg, be good to see ya!;
So you and yer friends were the landlubbers what saved her, eh?${prompt};
Don't ya worry none, she be sleepin' it off like a sailor that's too fond of Opo-opo brew. The whole ordeal's left me girl a bit under the weather, but she'll pull through.${prompt};
Hasn't stopped her talkin' me ears off, o'course. Can't get a word in edgewise.${prompt};
...I jus' be glad that me girl ain't forgotten about me.${prompt};
Even after walkin' the plank into the great beyond, she still remembers her old man.${prompt};
She may not be me daughter by blood, but she's still the apple of me eye. I do believe a reward be due you.${prompt};
Ya can have the pick of one of me treasures. I'll be givin' whatever's left to yer mates what helped ya.${prompt};
What do ya choose?;
${selection-lines};
Let me think about it.;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
That's what ya want?${prompt};
Ya want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Aye.;
Nay.${prompt};
Arrg, I almost be forgettin'. Me girl wants ya to pummel some beastie that's been hauntin' her dreams. Stuff o' nightmares, she says.${prompt};
Don't make much sense to me, but I be guessin' you know the truth of it. If ya ever need an old pirate's help, ya just let me know.${prompt};
Fer a girl what's saved the world, it be an endearin' thing fer her to be afraid of her dreams.${prompt};
Blimey. Are ya tryin' t'tell me that the savior of the world can't make up ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mind about a simple thing like this? Guess some things never change, eh?${prompt};
But who be I t'judge?;
Let me know when you've made yer decision.;
Jus' don't complain if all the best loot be taken!${prompt};
Arrg, so you've made a decision?${prompt};
By me bleedin' eyepatch, I can't be handing over any booty when yer bag be full of flotsam and jetsam. You heroes need to learn a thing o' two about organization!${prompt};
Here.;
That be a treasure unlike any you'll ever see again.;
Don't go losin' it over the side of no stinkin' ferry!${prompt};
Sorry, ${name-player}, the boss is a little busy right now.;
Ye'll have to make yer meetin' fer another day.${prompt};
I've not seen the boss with that look on his face fer a while.;
I mean, we all be happy as a buccaneer in a parrot shop to have Lion back, but there's somethin' else he's not tellin' us...${prompt};
Arrg! Forget I even said anythin'!;
The boss is jus' busy, that's all.;
Make yer meetin' fer another day!${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No â€œI'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!â€;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;

Begone! I've bigger fish to reel in.${prompt};
Hmph, so ya fancy yourself a ${choice-player-gender}[hero/heroine], eh?;
I guess ya look the part enough. How about I let ya in on a little secret?${prompt};
You've heard of the Voidwatch operation, haven't ya?;
Well, I'm in charge of dolin' out missions for it in these parts.${prompt};
The official line is that the Grand Duchy of Jeuno oversees the whole organization, with local branches in each of the three nations.;
"But any sailor worth 'is salt should already know that; elsewise, I'd suggest pullin' the kelp outcha ears an' payin' attention!${prompt}";
Anyway, protecting multiple nations is difficult. Yer ceaselessly runnin' long n' lonely border patrols lest a sudden squall blow yer hard-won peace clean to flinders.;
But you know what's easier to control than borders? Information.;
The extent of it that gets released to the public amounts to nothin' more than the mud-caked tip of Zuug the Shoreleaper's massive spear.${prompt};
The more deftly ya hide that unpleasant intelligence, the safer the citizens will feel. However, even a tiny point of truth can rip a nation to shreds if it pokes through. That's why ya have to keep things under wraps, ya see.${prompt};
Just like the old adage asserts, ignorance truly is bliss.;
Bweheheheh.${prompt};
And so, this is where we come in. We handle problems th' Duchy an' other nations don't want to dirty their pretty lil' white-gloved hands wid.;
Think of us as very unofficial--and very well-paid--deck swabbers, bwehehehe.${prompt};
Course this means bein' as black-'earted an' cold as th' void from which these abominations strike.;
And since so few know of our existence, we can go about our business in our own fashion. We need not concern ourselves with the political quagmire people call â€œdiplomacy.â€${prompt};
The long and the short of it is this: we're a necessary evil.${prompt};
Come to think of it, you adventurers aren't so different from us.;
"As long as ya can reap a reward, you'll do as needs doin' widdout so much as a roll of the eyes; and that's exactly the kind of attitude we need.${prompt}";
So, whaddya say? Want to earn a little coin by slinkin' through the shadows?${prompt};
Enlist in the operation?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I'm intrigued.;
No, it's too shady.${prompt};
Fine, go back t' hidin' behind yer mum's skirts if yer so scared of the dark.;
But don't go flappin' those oversized lips of yers about us to anyone, lest ya wake one morning wid none at all.;
But if ya ever get more heart than a rabbit, talk to me again and maybe maybe we'll find a use for ya.${prompt};
Come crawlin' back, have ya?${prompt};
A laudable decision. Now, pay attention, 'cause I'm not goin' to repeat myself.${prompt};
We have operatives stationed in both Kazham and Rabao--scratch their backs, and they'll scratch yers.${prompt};
What's this, scared already? I can't hear myself think o'er the sound of yer knees knockin', so pull y'self together till I've had my say.;
I never said this had to be a solo mission, whelp.${prompt};
Other adventurers have enlisted with us, most of them so strong they could eviscerate the likes of ya with a fingernail. Any one of them should make a fine companion. As much as I would love to prove my strength to ya on the battlefield, us officers are tasked only with supplyin' the locations and names of yer targets. So there.;
Oh, and ya better show some initiative from start to finish, or ya won't be gettin' anythin' from the pyxides.${prompt};
I hear the rewards for completin' these tasks are quite the treasures, too. Should ya happen to chance upon some courage within that craven heart of yours, ya may also fight alone and save them all for y'self.${prompt};
Ugh, I've had enough of that repulsive mug of yers. Get out of my face and come back when ya've actually done somethin'.${prompt};
Halt! Belay that order!;
I may not like the look of ya, but you'll be needin' this nonetheless.${prompt};
Even a dim greenhorn like y'self knows what ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} looks like, right?${prompt};
Just show this to my fellow agents in Kazham and Rabao.${prompt};
I'm sure I don't need to tell someone of yer oh-so-legendary stature that it's used to call forth Voidwalkers.;
However, procurin' some ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} might give ya the upper hand...not that yer haughty highness would need it.${prompt};
Also, my directives involve only the cloak-and-dagger aspects of this trade. I find no reason to concern myself with the mundane particulars of our operations.;
Should ya wish to risk having yer ears jabbered off over such banalities, go see a Voidwatch Officer.${prompt};
Ah, there ya are.;
I heard about yer exploits in Kazham and Rabao. Maybe I misjudged you...${prompt};
But don't assume ya've earned our trust after two measly missions.;
Come back when yer a bit more seasoned, then I might have something for ya.${prompt};
Why do I think this job would send you crying back to yer mother? Because the boss said so...in not quite so many words.${prompt};
Think yer a better judge of yer own abilities than the boss, eh?${prompt};
Then try finding a better way to grab the boss's attention.${prompt};
How exactly do ya accomplish that? Hahaha, don't make me split my sides.;
I thought ya called yourself an adventurer. Then use that half-rotten melon ya call a head and think of something y'self.${prompt};
In our world, perseverance is indispensable.;
No matter how much vitriol I spew, ya keep cryin' to me fer more. I can fault yer ugly mug, but not yer determination.${prompt};
If ya want my boss to recognize yer skills, try to do something worthy of an adventurer.;
It may take a while for a whelp like ya, but my boss isn't blind. He'll take notice of ya eventually.${prompt};
As for how to make him take notice, that half-rotten melon of yours should be able to figure it out.;
Best of luck to ya. Looks like you'll need it.${prompt};
Ah, there ya are.;
I heard about ya exploits in Kazham and Rabao, and...well, I suppose I misjudged ya.${prompt};
I have in my possession a document requesting yer presence, signed by none other than the head man himself.;
If he recognizes yer talents, who am I to question them.${prompt};
Anyway, let's brief ya on yer next assignment, shall we?${prompt};
Have ya heard the story of the airborne palace?;
That's where you'll be going.${prompt};
How in a Moblin mineshaft should I know? As far as I'm concerned, it's nothing but a wet nurse's tale!${prompt};
I've heard many accounts from the Near East of castles that float upon the sea, but one that flies in the sky? That's madness!${prompt};
The boss though, he should have some answers for ya. He's waitin' in his chambers, so go on in and stop shootin' the sheep with me.${prompt};
Ahoy, ${name-player}! 'Tis good to see yer hale 'n hearty, matey.${prompt};
I didn't want t' burden ye wit' another one of me infamous ramblings, but what kind of captain would I be if I sent me crew to sea wit' nary a jib nor oar?;
Just bite the bollard fer a bit and I'll be done as quick as possible...but I can't promise nothin', fer when ye've spent as much time twixt mast n' main as me, time starts t' mean somethin' else entirely.${prompt};
Ye'll next be shovin' off fer â€œSky.â€ Aye, that's right. Tu'Lia be yer destination.${prompt};
This ain't no Bibiki Bay or Buburimu Peninsula--hardly a soul knows 'bout this ethereal archipelago.;
To make matters worse, ev'ryone in ports across Vana'diel be gettin' their timbers shivered over some unseen scourge. And I'd be willin' t' wager ye all the gil in Norg that Jeuno knows somethin' 'bout this we don't.${prompt};
Burst me barnacles! If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was nothin' more'n the ramblings of some blunder'n boatswain.;
Arrrg, gone are the days when we pirates were the worst of the world's ills, matey.${prompt};
Still, we seem t' both be steerin' ourrr ships t'wards the same â€œXâ€ on the proverbial treasure map fer the time bein'...;
Yet seein' how our plans be wide as the horiz'n, we best not turn a patched eye to these problems.${prompt};
Keep this infermation below deck, if ye catch me drift. The situation be bad enough without the entire continent up in arms.;
In any case, I'll make sure t' apprrrise ye of any new developments if I get wind of 'em. Ye can count on that--cross me own plank and hope t' fly, stick a pegleg on me thigh.${prompt};
I fergot to mention somethin'! Yer still hoardin' that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ain'tcha?;
I think it's s'pposed to hatch or whatnot if'n ye raise it right. I ain't too sure on the partic'lars, though.;
Best ye check wit' me first mate Kieran on that.${prompt};
He knows the rest of the aft flotation--arrrg, I mean apt infermation. Maybe I truly do have a family of crows roostin' in me ol' crow's nest.;
May that stone serve ye well in yer travels, though, as ye may very well be the realm's only hope.${prompt};
Lastly, don't do anything out there a salty sea dog like meself wouldn't do, matey.${prompt};
Oh, you're back.;
The boss is waitin'. Hurry inside before ya make both me and him angry.${prompt};
First, thank ye fer doin' what needs be done. Me heart, it be waterlogged with guilt fer always makin' ye perform these underwater operations.${prompt};
Yet ye be the only one I can trust. Wit' all these lily-livered deckhands in me service--none be fit to hold a sword, if ye ask me.${prompt};
...Which makes it all the worse t' tell ye that we be gettin' drenched in this Voidwalker squall, and we be takin' on water faster'n we can bail it out. We still don't know much 'bout this perfect storm o' sorts either, which I find queerer than a cryin' kraken.${prompt};
The westerly winds bring wit' 'em tales of destruction from the Near East as well.${prompt};
Sadly, me hands be tied and I haven't the time t' drop down no dinghies fer ourrr neighbors to the east. ${prompt};
Which is why I be sendin' ye. I figured ye'd be hoistin' sail and shovin' off soon as ye heard this anyway, and that fire in yer belly be what we need most right now.${prompt};
The violence be spreadin' like Selbina butter on bread, and no matter how many fiends ye slay, thar be no end t' 'em.;
We ain't got the foggiest idea what be goin' on.${prompt};
Ye be the ballast that keeps Vana'diel upright, ${name-player}, and the realm needs ye now mor'n ever. This may not be worth a grain of salt, comin' from an old sailor tucked safely away in his captain's quarters, but don't go overboard wit' the heroics.${prompt};
Well, well...it seems you have quite a diverse circle of acquaintances. Know many individuals.;
It's remarkable that you've managed to make connections with a pirate, of all professions.${prompt};
All the more impressive is that humans could place such a monumental object into the sky.;
How regrettable that such technology was lost to the ages. Eluded the annals.${prompt};
In any case, the corsair is correct in asserting that the intruders' influence is spreading. Extending its tendrils.${prompt};
Your valiant efforts have so far mitigated the destruction, but soon you must face the scourge within Walk of Echoes. An inevitable encounter.${prompt};
In what form is this scourge manifest, you wonder? Ponder its identity?${prompt};
You have traversed the realm innumerable times and confronted myriad entities. A plethora of personages.;
Then perhaps then you can intuit my answer.;
Kupofried has offered to help expose the true nature of this threat, but such efforts have so far proven fruitless.${prompt};
It has us all drowning in a river of ignorance. Clawing clumsily at a mist of misunderstandings.${prompt};
When the river has run dry, I shall apprise you of any findings immediately.;
That silver-tongued sailor uttered a similar comment, but it bears repeating. Its iteration is warranted.;
Your prowess has never possessed such import as it soon will.${prompt};
While the Voidwalkers may be a concern, haven't you other endeavors to undertake? Horizons to expand?${prompt};
The bonds you form with the denizens of Vana'diel may be not be visible, but they are pertinent. Their significance is palpable.${prompt};
When the time comes, these bonds will constitute the source of your strength. A fountain of fortitude.${prompt};
And on that note, we must part. Scatter to the winds.;
May we meet again, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You again?;
I still can't conceive of what an airborne palace would look like, but it sounds as if the boss's briefing was sufficient for ya to get an idea.${prompt};
I suppose I'll leave the traveling to fantastical and incomprehensible locales to you.;
Anyway, I suggest ya get yer priorities straight while ya can.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Ask a bunch of questions.;
Participate in Voidwatch Ops.;
Request debriefing.;
Request ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]};
Check ${color: 5}voidstone${color: 1} stock.;
Request reward issuance.${prompt};
Like I said, I'm only here to tell ya where and what. I'll leave the cloud-skippin' mumbo jumbo to you.${prompt};
If ya truly need to know something, seek out a whatchamacallit...a Voidwatch Officer. Yes, that's who ya should ask. Didn't I tell ya that already?!;
Remember, it's not my job to deal with petty details.${prompt};
Very well then, let's get ya ready to ship out to that airborne palace immediately.${prompt};
What? Ya truly thought ya could just go prancin' up there without fulfilling yer duties?! I don't know where ya come from, but here in Norg, we have to work to get what we want! First, we need yer services in the Li'Telor region. Ya can spread yer little wings and take to the sky after that's done.${prompt};
Now, where to dispatch ya...;
How about the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, the Boyahda Tree and...last but not least, Ro'Maeve? Those three jurisdictions should do nicely.${prompt};
No need to make water in yer britches about their order, either. Simply completin' yer objectives in the appointed sectors is enough for me.;
Oh yes, and be sure to report back to me when you're finished. Unfortunately fer ya, I haven't the power to read people's thoughts.${prompt};
Is that a scowl of insubordination on yer face? Hah! I spit in yer general direction! Ya adventurers are supposed to enjoy adventuring, no? Otherwise, why would ya be dubbed â€œadventurersâ€? Now go out there and make the Voidwatch proud!${prompt};
Admittedly, I'm somewhat hesitant to grant ya this privilege, but I suppose you've earned it.;
Yes, I'm saying ya may finally embark for that airborne continent.;
Hmmm...are these names code or somethin'? I've never heard any of them before! Maybe you have, though.${prompt};
I'm in the dark about all this, but the captain assured me that yer ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has accrued enough energy. Apparently you'll be needin' it in the near future.${prompt};
Movin' on, you'll be dispatched to the followin' three areas.${prompt};
The Ru'Aun Gardens, Ve'Lugannon Palace, and the Shrine of Ru'Avitau. Ugh, I'm tyin' my tongue in knots just trying to say all that.${prompt};
Ya remember them yet?;
Good. Get goin', then.;
As always, report back to me when yer finished fricasseein' yer foes.${prompt};
And bring me back a souvenir, will ya?${prompt};
Are ya absolutely sure ya got all that?${wait-36: 1};
Fine, then get on gettin' on.${prompt};

How many would you like?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Just one.;

Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.;
Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt};
By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt};
At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt};
That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt};
From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt};
But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt};
The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.;
As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt};
We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt};
Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.;
For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt};
Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt};

On my way here, though, I <sigh> got lost in a cave. I always get lost.${prompt};
I was able to get out by remembering to put my right hand on the wall and...ugh, you don't care.${prompt};
Eventually I wandered here. With all the strange artifacts around, this isn't the worst place I could've ended up.${prompt};

On the prowl fer Gilgamesh, scallywag? Ya'll find him a bit farther in.${prompt};

Didya get bumped about by the waves on yer way here, ${name-player}? No matter. The boss be waitin' inside fer ya.${prompt};
Oho! Would ya look who's decided ta join us!${prompt};
Master!${prompt};
I am both humbled and honored to be able to exchange words with you once more.${prompt};
I have followed your instructions to the letter. Months upon years have I toiled, seeking guidance from both man and the heavens, never once letting my training or dedication falter.${prompt};
All this I have done so that we may meet once more.${prompt};
Unworthy though your disciple Iroha may be, her words and emotions are true.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Who?;
Master?${prompt};
Ya got krill in yer ears, ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]? She's callin' you her master!${prompt};
What kind of master runs around fergettin' who their pupils are?${wait-36: 1};
Ya mean to say ya don't remember her at all?${prompt};
What's all this malarkey?${prompt};
Do not get angry at ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]. It is only natural that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] not remember me.${prompt};
I have wholly lost track of what year this is. 884, correct?${prompt};
This time is many, many years before I came to be, and my presence here is somewhat of an anomaly.${prompt};
Did ya hit yer head 'fore I found ya floating adrift or somethin'?${prompt};
You mean to say...that you haven't been born yet?${prompt};
Then how'd ya get here?${prompt};
I come from an age far in the future, when Vana'diel stands on a precipice--and the master is the only one who can guide me.${prompt};
So you mean to say that ${name-player}...is this master of yours?${prompt};
And from that outfit yer wearing, I'd wager ya were born in the Far East.${prompt};
That is correct. I am the guardian of Reisenjima Sanctorium, and have a strong link with the heavens as its chief priestess.${prompt};
Oho. I know the particulars of the eastern faith are a bit foreign ta the rest of us, but Altana remains a central figure even there.${prompt};
So that'd make ya a religious authority, then?${prompt};
And let me guess. The power of the spirits sent you back ta our time?${prompt};
They set me adrift so that I may prevent the darkness which has engulfed my era.${prompt};
What's this then? You're going to have to be a bit more straightforward.${prompt};
Does this mean that the beastmen end up victorious in the end? Or is it something far more nefarious?${prompt};
Master, do I have your leave to show them our reality?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
That's probably best.;
It's better they not know.${prompt};
Ahem! Who do ya think risked life and limb to save your pupil there from becomin' shark chow!?${prompt};
By your will.${prompt};
In the age from whence I hail, Vana'diel is gripped in the vise of fear.${prompt};
In my homeland, we refer to it as â€œEmptiness,â€ a blanket of darkness that infects all it touches.${prompt};
The master is our only light of hope. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] halted the advance of such a sinister force once, and we are confident that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can do it again.${prompt};
The master and ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] comrades strove tirelessly for a brighter future, and their tale is known by all in time.${prompt};
Many months and years passed. I came to be in this world and trained diligently under the master's gentle hand. Yet it was not long before the skies began to cloud...both figuratively and literally.${prompt};
It descended like a thick miasma, stifling the land under a blanket of silence.${prompt};
I looked into the master's eyes and could see the truth. My homeland was not the only victim. Quon, Mindartia, Adoulin...${prompt};
The end times were upon us, and both man and Goddess were powerless to stop it.${prompt};
But then...how did ya survive?${prompt};
The master and my father sacrificed themselves.${prompt};
My mother is from an island known as Reisenjima, the land where the final struggle took place.${prompt};
Vanquishing the Emptiness was but a fantasy. It was all I could do to erect a barrier to halt its advance.${prompt};
A Pyrrhic victory, indeed, as the walls of Reisenjima's sanctorum could do naught but echo back my own solitary cries.${prompt};
I was trapped for several years, when a spirit descended from the heavens to alight on a nearby brazier.${prompt};
She told me that there was only one speck of hope that could save us...${prompt};
The master. I was to find the master and join my light with ${choice-player-gender}[his/hers].${prompt};
The spirits opened a path for me, guiding me back here...to this point in Vana'diel's history.${prompt};
Master, I would like to give you this, lest I forget to do so at a later juncture.${prompt};
From what you told me, there will be many trials posed to you before you finally set foot in the land you know today as the Far East.${prompt};
Keep this by your side and the path will remain open to you, always.${prompt};
Follow its guidance and it will lead you unfailingly to my time. However...${prompt};
Now jus' hang on a minute. If we jus' follow it without doin' anythin' else, we'll just end up at yer apocalyptic future where yer the only one left alive, right?${prompt};
...That is correct. However, the master surely has the capacity to experience both futures...one with the Emptiness, and one without.${prompt};
Please...find a way to...to...${prompt};
I cannot...stay...long...${prompt};
What in blazes--!?${prompt};
${name-player}, I can't make heads or tails of the whole thing. Think she's tellin' the truth?${prompt};
This warrants further study. I'll see if my agents can pick up on anything.${prompt};
<Sigh> I've ne'er been too good at dealin' with complex twists and turns.${prompt};
Gimme some time ta collect me thoughts.${prompt};
Maybe there is somethin' ta that tale Iroha spun. There've been more an' more oddities happenin' of late.${prompt};
All manner of ne'er-before-seen beasts...people gettin' lost in places that look familiar but are somehow a bit off...and so much more that I could mention.${prompt};
At first I figured the beastmen were behind it all, but now I'm not so sure.${prompt};
We gotta take stock of the situation and dig up any common threads.${prompt};
Ideally, you'd be wantin' to talk to my daughter, Lion.${prompt};
A bit of a tomboy, that one, but there're none in the Middle Lands as could match her clue-gathering skills.${prompt};
There's just the small question of where she ran off ta this time.${prompt};
She bolted out of here a couple of days ago, asserting that the best way to ascertain the Beastman Confederate's plans was to put out feelers amongst allies in the three nations.${prompt};
It stands to reason, then, that she's either in Bastok, San d'Oria, or Windurst.${prompt};
Then ya might run across her durin' the course of some beastmen-related missions.${prompt};
Head back to yer home nation and follow up on that threat first.${prompt};
Normally I'd entrust this to me daughter, Lion...${prompt};
She was a bit of a tomboy, and there was none better than her at findin' stuff out.${prompt};
But now she's...she's...;
Well, maybe ya can find somethin' we can't.${prompt};
Hey, turn that thing off!${prompt};
...Holla...Dem...Mea...;
Seek...the crystal...${prompt};
What was that light all about?${prompt};
A voice, ya say? I didn't hear a blasted thing.${prompt};
But hey, if ya say so, then ya probably did. Hopefully it gave ya something to go on--which is a darn sight better than anything I can do.${prompt};
At least, Lion has a keen eye for these things.${prompt};
She's slowly regainin' her strength, but it's still not uncommon for her to spend the whole mornin' in bed either...${prompt};
Wh-what's goin' on?${prompt};
...Holla...Dem...Mea...;
Seek...the crystals...${prompt};
What was that light all about?${prompt};
Ya made it back!${prompt};
Iroha's been pacin' back an' forth all day.${prompt};
Master, tales of your victory against the Shadow Lord has reached our ears!${prompt};
History is one battle closer to being set on the proper course.${prompt};
...and also brings us closer ta oblivion.${prompt};
But we first may bring history to the point where the master is able to face the future.${prompt};
Suppose so.${prompt};
Upon my return, I spent hours turning over the master's words in my mind, and something came to gnaw at me.${prompt};
I cannot shake the feeling it is related to what Lady Lion prophesized in Escha about the master's role in the coming battle against the darkness.${prompt};
Somethin' 'bout yer orb needin' ta gain light?${prompt};
Correct. We must create a world in which the master is able to fight.${prompt};
An' what 'bout that bothers ya?${prompt};
Think back upon your struggle with the Shadow Lord.${prompt};
When we first met, many years from now, the master mentioned something that happened that day.${prompt};
â€œI felt the crystal resonate within.â€${prompt};
Please, try to think back.${prompt};
Warrior of the Crystal--one who will become known as a Warrior of Light...${prompt};
You ${choice: 1}[have traveled/will travel] across land, sea, and sky, bathed in the light and stopping darkness wherever it threatens the living.${prompt};
And you will continue to banish the doubt that resides within you.${prompt};
Banish the doubt that lies within and let radiance fill your soul.${prompt};
Such travels take their toll on lesser mortals, who retire to their homes and live out their lives in comfort.${prompt};
But although you may stop briefly to gather your wits, each time you do so it is only to steel your resolve for the next struggle.${prompt};
You have the will to shelter the downtrodden, vex the darkness, and protect all that Altana holds dear.${prompt};
The time is right for you to become more than a mere warrior.${prompt};
You will become greater...${wait-36: 1};
For that is what is required of you.${prompt};
Has it come back to you, Master?${prompt};
You recalled with reverence those words, saying they gave you the strength of spirit to carry on no matter the odds.${prompt};
Though your journeys were arduous and fraught with peril, the twinkle in your eyes as you recounted your tales gave me courage.${prompt};
The reason you were able to lead us in the final struggle was precisely because of those many barriers you had overcome.${prompt};
You taught me that the world was worth fighting for, no matter how bleak the future.${prompt};
My father always spoke of you with adoration, believing that you were a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of indisputable valor.${prompt};
Banish your doubt, Master, so that you may become all you were meant to be!${prompt};
You have conquered much, and the time has come to fill yourself with radiance!${prompt};
Now that ya mention it, Iroha, just who is this father of yers?${prompt};
Well...${prompt};
Boss!!! Somethin' terrible has happened!;
There's big trouble at Sea Serpent Grotto!${prompt};
Boats are just turnin' and turnin' and no one can leave!${prompt};
No boats are able ta make it ta Norg at all!${prompt};
There was this infernal ringin' noise an' the boats are just spinnin' in place!${prompt};
Ya mean ta say that all of this started happenin' at once?${prompt};
...Wait. â€œTurnin' round and round...â€ â€œSpinnin' in place...â€${prompt};
Obviously they're both caused by the same thing.${prompt};
The bell...${prompt};
Does this mean ya know somethin', Zeid? ${name-player}?${prompt};
Have any idea?;
${selection-lines};
I'm not sure...;
Just like in Escha...${prompt};
${name-player}, think back. We heard something similar in Escha, at the place that looked like the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.${prompt};
Exactly. I have the same thought.${prompt};
Aha. So if ya two have experienced the same thing, then there's no one better ta get ta the bottom of this.${prompt};
We should head to the grotto, ${name-player}, but it'll be quicker if we split up. I'll go on ahead while you prepare.${prompt};
Master, I insist on accompanying you!${prompt};
Zeid here's told me 'bout how you resolved our li'l problem.${prompt};
It concerns me that Iroha wasn't the only one who came from the future.${prompt};
Perhaps she would be able to answer some of our questions...${prompt};
If she were still here.${prompt};
But Aldo may've found us someone who can help us anyway. Isn't that right?${prompt};
I've managed to find someone familiar with Reisenjima Sanctorium.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you made the acquaintance of one known as Tenzen?${prompt};
Do you know Tenzen?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Nope.${prompt};
Are you certain? He claims to have a prior relationship with you.${prompt};
I see. ${choice: 0}[Then I scarce need to remind you that he/Perhaps the name gives it away, but he] is a warrior hailing from the Far East.${prompt};
Some time ago, he appeared in Jeuno to appeal for aid to the Duke Vicarious...something about an â€œEmptinessâ€ threatening to consume his homeland.${prompt};
This Emptiness thing of his surely must have some connection to the future Iroha was on about.${prompt};
Indeed. Remember, ${name-player}, that Siren mentioned a future without time?${prompt};
But back to this Tenzen...where is he?${prompt};
Word is that he concluded his business here and returned to his homeland.${prompt};
He journeys throughout the Middle Lands, but I couldn't tell you any more.${prompt};
I'm having my men put out feelers.${prompt};
Good work, Aldo. See what ya can find out.${prompt};
Even if we succeed in findin' him, ${name-player}, we can't be sure he'll have any answers.${prompt};
But we won't know until we find him.${prompt};
In the interim, I will keep learning what I can about our imposter Zi'Tah.${prompt};
Here's a bit of a trifle from Jeuno. May it help you find answers...answers we need now more than ever...${prompt};
Ugh. We aren't open for business yet.${prompt};

Yes, I can engrave your ${item-singular: 33[2]} with arcane glyptics.${prompt};
Ugh. I'll need the following materials for the engraving process. What a terrible bother.${prompt};
And don't forget the handling fee of ${number: 1} silt for your ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
After the engraving process is complete, the ${item-singular: 2[2]} will look as follows.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 33[2]}.${prompt};
The only good thing that came from training under that insufferable Divainy-Gamainy is my skill in engraving arcane glyptics.${prompt};
...But first comes the mezzotinting.${prompt};
There are generally three or four different types of arcane glyptics that can be engraved, with the specifics differing per item.${prompt};
I'm not very confident about your ability to successfully use engraved equipment, but if you want me to begin the process anyway, you'll need to give me materials such as ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Nor is it a simple process of hand waving and enchantment muttering. It requires skill, finesse, and--most relevant to you--attempt after repeated attempt.${prompt};
I feel queasy at the very thought of...;
<Sigh> Well, what other choice do I have? It pains me to say this, but if you aren't satisfied with the results of the engraving, you can undergo the mezzotinting process again and choose a different type of glyptic.${prompt};
I charge a fee of ${number: 1} silt in addition to the base materials, ${number: 2} to augment using your materials, and will do a new mezzotinting for ${number: 3} silt. But for the love of all that is holy--don't make me work harder than I have to.${prompt};
Let me take a look at your ${item-singular: 33[2]}.${prompt};
Which kind of arcane glyptic would you like?${prompt};
Which type do you want engraved?;
${selection-lines};
I've changed my mind.;
Arcane Glyptic Type A.;
Arcane Glyptic Type B.;
Arcane Glyptic Type C.;
Arcane Glyptic Type D.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 33[2]} is already engraved with arcane glyptics, but I would be â€œhappyâ€ to remove them for you.${prompt};
Remove the glyptics?;
${selection-lines};
Yes. I want new mezzotinting.;
Let me think...${prompt};
The next stage of arcane glyptics will look as follows. Are you sure?${prompt};
This is what your item will look like. Are you sure?${prompt};
Further engrave the item?;
${selection-lines};
Yes. I'm pleased with that.;
I've changed my mind.${prompt};
You'll have to fork over ${number: 1} escha silt to have your ${item-singular: 2[2]} mezzotinted.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 3[2]} has successfully undergone mezzotinting.${prompt};
You don't have enough escha silt.${prompt};
I shall deign to engrave your ${item-singular: 33[2]} with arcane glyptics if you trade it to me.${prompt};
I'm incredibly pleased to report that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be engraved with any arcane glyptics at all! Maybe I can finally catch a quick rest...${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be engraved any further.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has not yet undergone mezzotinting, but I shall hold onto it for you anyway.${prompt};
Our warehouses are slowly filling up with all manner of ${choice: 0}[equipment and /]materials from adventurers who have made forays into Escha, and quite frankly, keeping track of our inventory is quite the hassle.${prompt};
You'd be doing me a favor by taking them off my hands...but I'm still going to charge you a fee in the form of escha beads.${prompt};

Those clever smiths from the West have been engraving their weapons with these glyptics for generations. You gotta figure, if it's worth doing for generations, it's probably still worth doing now, am I right?${prompt};
Just trade me the necessary ingredients and I'll be happy as a clam to engrave the glyptic to your equipment.${prompt};
I'll store and process all the ingredients right here in preparation for the engraving.${prompt};
I'll just need to charge a small handling fee of ${number: 1} silt for each ingredient you trade to me.${prompt};
But since I love my customers oh so very much, I'll engrave the glyptic on your equipment for squat-diddly free! That's right!${prompt};
Just trade me your equipment after you've traded me the ingredients and I'll have your new and augmented equipment ready before you can say â€œglypta-mazingâ€!${prompt};
Some equipment can take multiple glyptics, so keep that in mind!${prompt};
I'll be sure to tell you which glyptics can go on the piece of equipment you trade to me, so don't worry about remembering each one!${prompt};
Yikes-aroonies! Where did you get such a fine grade of this? At this level of purity I can probably start cutting and setting right away...amazing......${prompt};
...Uh, sorry, I must have zoned out for a second there. This is excellent material! No processing should be necessary!${prompt};
If you'd like me to engrave and arcane glyptic for you, just trade me the piece of equipment along with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I'll need some special tools to work with this, however, so this will require a special handling fee of ${number: 1} silt.${prompt};
I can engrave the following pieces of equipment. Isn't it amazing!${prompt};

Can't cha see I'm busy? Come back later.${prompt};
Hey, you! I see ya got some Domain Points on ya.${prompt};
Yep, dem's the ones.${prompt};
Ya see, they're a type of viscous fluid that drops after defeatin' unusual monsters in a Domain Invasion. The amount in this here bottle's worth 10 points.${prompt};
It's too hard fer the people of Escha to tell the difference between silt, beads, and the like. So that's why I came up with this name!${prompt};
Hehehe! Pretty easy to remember, no?${prompt};
Anyways, about these Domain Points... Much like the monsters that drop 'em, there's a limit to how much ya can handle per day.${prompt};
That makes 'em a lot more difficult than silt or beads when it comes to conductin' one's research.${prompt};
However, they gave me a glimpse of the future! I know they'll make it big eventually!${prompt};
So that's why I started gatherin' what I could. Of course, I'm willin' to trade fer 'em. So bring me as many as ya can!${prompt};

Ol' sea dog, have ya heard anythin' 'bout where this stoic warrior guy â€œTenzenâ€ is?${prompt};
'Fraid I can't let ya see our leader until he comes along, what with all this Escha hullabaloo goin' on.${prompt};
Gilgamesh, I'm afraid the rumors are true. Another rift has split the ground in Misareaux Coast in twain.${prompt};
Then it's th' same deal as with Qufim Island? This place the lot of ya keep referrin' to as â€œEschaâ€?${prompt};
Damned ambassador of the void! He'd better not show his face 'round here in Norg, or it's right ta Davy Jones's locker with him!${prompt};
Oho, if it isn't ${name-player}! Our friend from the Far East has stopped to pay his regards.${prompt};
Ah, I recognize that visage...${prompt};
Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}. Your presence here is a boon.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, forgive me...would that I had been stronger...${prompt};
I am Tenzen, a humble warrior with roots planted firmly in the Far East. May our meeting bear fruit.${prompt};
I shall be brief. Word reached me that a priestess from Reisenjima Sanctorium had cause to step foot here in the Middle Lands, and I came to pay my respects.${prompt};
Yet I arrive here only to find that she has gone missing.${prompt};
${name-player}, I suppose ya haven't bumped inta Iroha?${prompt};
Iroha...a magnificent name, and I trust with a character to match.${prompt};
Ya happen ta know anythin' 'bout her? 'Cause she sure threw th' lot of us for quite the loop.${prompt};
I have extensively questioned those at Reisenjima Sanctorium, but to a man they shook their heads at each inquiry.${prompt};
Of course, if your story is true and she has not yet been born, then such a conclusion is foregone.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, permit me to examine the orb she bequeathed unto you.${prompt};
...Intriguing.;
Yes, it bears the mark of Reisenjima Sanctorium.${prompt};
What in blazes--!?;
Calm yerself, Aldo. She's with our guest.${prompt};
This orb connects the bearer with ${choice: 1}[the mothercrystal/a higher power].${prompt};
Mayhap it will display its true form only to those who open up their hearts to it.${prompt};
Delkfutt's Tower...;
Ah, you look confused. My companion is intimately connected with the outlying isle that Reisenjima Sanctorium calls home.${prompt};
Her assertion that the orb is authentic is proof enough.${prompt};
As such, I am inclined to believe this â€œIrohaâ€'s story about being from the future.${prompt};
I gotta admit, when I saw the little lady floppin' about on that rickety vessel, I wondered if the brine had clogged up that skull o' hers...but then we learned she wasn't the only one from th' future.${prompt};
Then there were others?${prompt};
None in the Far East bear any ill will toward the priests of Reisenjima Sanctorium...${prompt};
And only the purest chosen by the emperor are allowed to alight on the isle housing Reisenjima Sanctorium, for it was created by the gods themselves.${prompt};
Any who would lift a blade in anger against such souls are unworthy of being called human.${prompt};
Then it should not surprise you to learn that our foe isn't human at all.${prompt};
Darkness is at his beck and call, and he can create entire worlds devoid of all color.${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Then I must meet with Lady Iroha and find this sinister force that came after her.${prompt};
Where should I begin my search?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I saw ${choice: 1}[a woman/Prishe] just now...;
I'm at a loss.${prompt};
Ah, so the orb showed you a vision.${prompt};
And it implored you to return to Delkfutt's Tower.${prompt};
Perhaps it has something to do with what Kagero said...some relation with the ${choice: 1}[Mothercrystal/higher power].${prompt};
I must first make for Jeuno to collect what information I can...and handle some unfinished business.${prompt};
Then we've got all th' clues we need.${prompt};
I shall report back with anything I am able to find.${prompt};
${name-player}, I think it best if you cast your lot with Tenzen.${prompt};
Maybe he'll be able to figure out how to save the future when he gets to meet with Iroha.${prompt};
That's what my gut's tellin' me, anyway, and a pirate's intuition is never wrong.${prompt};
Oi, ${name-player}! Ya really got a knack fer showin' up when people are thinking about ya.${prompt};
'Member how we were talkin' 'bout a new vortex in Misareaux Coast?${prompt};
Iroha's been spotted around there every couple o' days.${prompt};
...And you didn't know, did ya?${prompt};
The two of ya last parted ways o'er in Aht Urhgan, right?${prompt};
Figured she'd've met up with ya once she was feelin' better, but for whatever reason she's decided to strike out on her own.${prompt};
Ya ha!;
Ya musta had a big fallin'-out!${prompt};
Did you have a falling-out?;
${selection-lines};
Yeah.;
Nope.;
What do you mean?${prompt};
Then go crawlin' on yer hands and knees and beg fer her forgiveness!${prompt};
Bah, it's probably nothin'. Kids her age can be that way.${prompt};
${choice: 0}[You have impure thoughts about her/You're jealous of her]!${prompt};
Well, best for me not ta get in the middle.;
Now that you know where she's been spotted, ya'd best head there too.${prompt};
Knowin' Tenzen, he's probably in a tizzy and gone to Misareaux Coast already.${prompt};
Truth be told, I can't imagine what it would be like ta die once, let alone over and over...${prompt};
Youth is always so brash. Hopefully the three of ya can overcome the trials that are ta come.${prompt};
Yar, Iroha's already given me the skinny.${prompt};
So yer off ta meet the ancients, hmm?${prompt};
Then what I'm 'bout ta tell ya is th' same as before: ya gotta go to the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};
Ain't too far, and if ye've been there once then it shouldn't be a problem ta make th' trek again.${prompt};
Best place ta get in contact with 'em would be over in the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};
Ain't but a waddle away.${prompt};
Best place to find whatcha seek would be in the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};
But don't ya be needin' ta lay anchor in Kazham first?${prompt};
Sir Gilgamesh, I fear we know little and less about this temple of which you speak.${prompt};
It's a bit ta the east, beyond Yuhtunga Jungle, deep in th' innermost recesses of Yhoator Jungle.${prompt};
Surely you'll want a few of my best men ta go with ya. Wouldn't do havin' ya get lost.${prompt};
That would be a boon.${prompt};
Master, let us rendezvous at the temple.${prompt};
I relish the opportunity to meet with a Kuluu.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, perhaps you have some unfinished business to take care of first. We shall scout on ahead.${prompt};
I bid you finish your tasks without delay.${prompt};
${name-player}, why the dour look? Everyone's looking to you for guidance, so keep your chin up!${prompt};
Yo, Zeid, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] isn't th' only one. My head's been swimmin' with worry these past few days.${prompt};
It's about Escha, isn't it?${prompt};
I had one of my more trustworthy...friends see what he could find.${prompt};
Th' mystery grows deeper by th' day. As he spent more days within Escha, he began ta speak in tongues and happen upon knowledge that no one should have.${prompt};
It's spooked the lot of us.${prompt};
Hmmm?${prompt};
And speak of the devil. Atori-Tutori, how fares yer search?${prompt};
You asked me to go to Escha - Ru'Aun, and that's exactly what I did.${prompt};
Odd place, that one. The pastaru and the future are all garbled.${prompt};
I think I get it. It's a place where time doesn't exist.${prompt};
What do you mean, â€œdoesn't existâ€?${prompt};
Our li'l friend Siren was goin' on about it.${prompt};
We can only hope that no more o' those vortexes pop up. Hopefully Siren can figure out somethin'.${prompt};
Have you sought her out?${prompt};
Nay. But she's off ta fight the ambassador, so hopefully she'll give him his comeuppance.${prompt};
This kooky samurai guy was ranting on and on about seeing Siren in Misareaux Coast.${prompt};
That's more than just a passing oddity-woddity. Two of those biddies?${prompt};
Two biddies?${prompt};
Oho, perhaps â€œbiddiesâ€ is too harsh of a term for one of such feminine wiles.${prompt};
That's not quite what I was getting at.${prompt};
But if there are two, wouldn't it stand to reason that it's another anomaly caused by the darkness?${prompt};
Who knows? It's possible my eyes were playing tricks on me.${prompt};
Anythin's possible given what we know of Escha so far.${prompt};
And speaking of Escha, we can head there again from that new vortex.${prompt};
Escha - Ru'Aun...;
I've heard tell that another masked individual has been coming and going from there.${prompt};
You know how Tenzen and Iroha are--they hear about something remotely dangerous and run off to fight it faster than a chocobo chasing gysahl greens.${prompt};
And knowing you, ${name-player}, you'll be right on their heels. Just promise you'll come back if things get out of hand.${prompt};
I gotta agree with the man. Doesn't take a seer ta read the ill omens there.${prompt};
Whole damn place is as silent as death itself.${prompt};
All the more reason for heroes-weroes like me to save what needs saving!${prompt};
Now that he's gone, Gilgamesh...just who is he?${prompt};
Just a man with special connections to th' Tenshodo.${prompt};
Might be a bit plump 'round the stomach, but ain't an adventurer in the world who hasn't--or isn't gonna--cross paths with him.${prompt};
Even ol' Maat in Jeuno respects this guy.${prompt};
Is that so?${prompt};
And ${name-player}--if ya wanna get a bit stronger yerself, I recommend ya talk with Maat before goin' ta Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt};
If you say we can trust him, then I've no cause to doubt. Let's head for Escha - Ru'Aun.${prompt};
I dun know if Prishe 'n Tenzen are out swabbin' the decks, but they sure ain't here.${prompt};
The boss can't do a damned thing without th' two of 'em, so ya might wanna come back a bit later.${prompt};
Yo, ${name-player}. Guess who made it?${prompt};
Hehe! I decided to join in on the party.${prompt};
I know you're all chomping at the bit about your doom-and-gloom future, but it's the present that's really lit a fire under my behind.${prompt};
And c'mon. I'm not about to let the lot of you hog all the fun.${prompt};
There's been so much happening of late that I can't help but wonder if we should be more concerned with the â€œnowâ€ than the â€œthen.â€${prompt};
So I had been hoping that I could lend my aid to the cause.${prompt};
Gilgamesh filled me in on what happened after the whole Iroha in Jeuno thing.${prompt};
Gilgamesh was kind enough to give me an explanation on what happened after we left Jeuno.${prompt};
Goin' over every last detail woulda killed my voice, but I made sure ta cover the important parts.${prompt};
And I gotta admit--she ${choice: 1}[and Lion /]did a great job of watchin' over Iroha.${prompt};
Iroha's a real trooper. You gotta admire her spunk!${prompt};
I'm just glad Iroha has recovered nicely.${prompt};
Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}. Good to see you looking well.${prompt};
I trust that you successfully met with Selh'teus?${prompt};
Pray forgive me for what happened earlier.${prompt};
Let us put that behind us that we may discuss what you learned from him.${prompt};
A new crystal to be born in Reisenjima!?${prompt};
Finally, a light to pierce the clouds!${prompt};
Now this might clear up your whole â€œEmptinessâ€ bit, eh, Tenzen? Victory all around!${prompt};
Sir Selh'teus's story about the crystal...it does not add up.${prompt};
If I remember correctly, the crystal does not appear now, but rather several years hence.${prompt};
So if history is to play out that way, then why...${prompt};
...Why would it be changed now? Its coming is supposed to be long after the Emptiness has been pushed back.${prompt};
I fear for how the future might change.${prompt};
But if this is to be the method for saving the Far East, then we have a responsibility to see it out!${prompt};
Do you mean for us to abandon hope!?${prompt};
This geezer's got the right of it. If the Emptiness has got a chokehold on the future, then we've gotta do everything we can to chop its arms off!${prompt};
So the crystal appears a few years earlier. What's the big deal?${prompt};
It simply has me concerned.${prompt};
Even though the crystal is there in my time, the all-encroaching darkness still claims victory.${prompt};
The crystal alone is not enough to save us.${prompt};
Then we need to come up with a solution that strikes at the root of the problem.${prompt};
Well, old buddy, looks like your journey isn't quite done.${prompt};
Well, Tenzen, you'll still be needing to pack a wallop, won't you?${prompt};
Sure, you might've stopped the Emptiness, but there's still a bit more darkness to smack around.${prompt};
The time for you to sheathe your blade hasn't arrived yet, Tenzen.${prompt};
Though the Emptiness has been stopped, Vana'diel still has need of your service.${prompt};
Long had I thought that it would be years before things returned to normal.${prompt};
But Selh'teus's crystal is a grand step in a positive direction.${prompt};
But, Sir Tenzen, something still vexes me.${prompt};
If I remember correctly, the crystal does not appear now, but rather several years hence.${prompt};
If the crystal were to manifest now, then the future will be irrevocably altered.${prompt};
But is that not exactly what we desire?${prompt};
So the crystal appears a few years earlier. What's the big deal?${prompt};
Should we not be glad that the problem may be solved before it even starts?${prompt};
Perhaps.${prompt};
Yet even though the crystal is there in my time, the all-encroaching darkness still claims victory.${prompt};
The crystal alone is not enough to save us.${prompt};
No matter how much we bash our heads against the problem, we can't find a good solution.${prompt};
I'll be damned if we aren't overlooking something... What is causing the Emptiness?${prompt};
I don't understand what could be wrong.${prompt};
We're clearly overlooking something. Do you think Bahamut might have the answers we seek?${prompt};
Lady Prishe, please continue to hunt for clues.${prompt};
'Course I will!${prompt};
Of course.${prompt};
...Master.${prompt};
Please proffer your opinion on Selh'teus's crystal plan.${prompt};
What do you think?;
${selection-lines};
I think earlier is fine.;
We should be careful.;
I'll do anything to meet Altana.${prompt};
If it means solvin' the problems in the Far East, then I'm all fer it.${prompt};
And it's good for business, too.${prompt};
So let's summarize, hmm?${prompt};
Iroha is opposed ta Selh'teus's plan, hmm?${prompt};
You and Iroha are opposed to Selh'teus's plan, hmm?${prompt};
â€œOpposedâ€ may be too strong a word. I would simply implore us to proceed with utmost caution.${prompt};
I believe we can trust Siren when she says that the crystal in the Far East was intimately connected with this problem.${prompt};
We must banish the Emptiness surrounding Reisenjima to have any hope of meeting Altana...${prompt};
That must be the reason why Siren gave us the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
And the orb I entrusted to Master remains pivotal.${prompt};
It is a priceless artifact of Reisenjima Sanctorium that ties the bearer with the mothercrystal.${prompt};
None are lost when they follow its guidance.${prompt};
We should not brashly rush into an uncertain decision, but instead wait for a sign.${prompt};
Well, ${name-player}, if you agree, then we've gotta take a different approach.${prompt};
Namely, finding out more about that beastie what's stealin' the crystals' power.${prompt};
And if Selh'teus wants you to find someone with â€œan absolute dominion over magicâ€... ${prompt};
Then there's only one person I can think of.${prompt};
That old witch, Shantotto!${prompt};
Of course, old la...er, Shantotto!${prompt};
I'm loath to say this, but perhaps he meant Doctor Shantotto.${prompt};
I'm...not sure if bringin' Iroha along's the best idea.${prompt};
Why would that be?${prompt};
If she found out you were from the future, she'd poke, prod, and quite possibly vivisect you.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, we have our next destination: Windurst Walls.${prompt};
Bring me a present!${prompt};
Best of luck!${prompt};
Could it be that the one trying to steal the crystals' energy is not the ambassador, but...?${prompt};
Master!${prompt};
The butterflies in my stomach have calmed down knowing that you are all right.${prompt};
What a horrifying tale...${prompt};
So this Balamor was tryin' ta create a world for him, and him alone.${prompt};
And he was usin' th' ambassador to do just that?${prompt};
I can't decide if he's a master or a moron.${prompt};
I can recall that Master told me stories of how ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] came across Balamor in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] adventures throughout Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt};
I have heard tales of such a specter in Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt};
This may yet be another aspect of history I have changed by coming here.${prompt};
And now th' important question. ${name-player}, what of th' ambassador?${prompt};
What happened to the ambassador?;
${selection-lines};
I don't know.;
He may still be enchained.;
He might have gotten away.${prompt};
The question is whether he still resides in the vortex, or if he managed to escape...${prompt};
Not knowing where he is poses quite the obstacle in proceeding.${prompt};
Well, I'd say this--if that Balamor guy's vortex disappeared, then I'd bet gil ta grapes that th' ties binding him vanished, too.${prompt};
On th' â€œbrightâ€ side, this may have bought us more time ta light up that orb of yers.${prompt};
Well, I'd say this--if that Balamor guy's vortex disappeared, then I'd bet gil ta grapes that th' ties binding him vanished, too.${prompt};
On th' â€œbrightâ€ side, this may have bought us more time ta light up that orb of yers.${prompt};
Should that be the case, he may make another attempt on your life, Master.${prompt};
I just hope we can get that orb filled with light in time!${prompt};
In any event, there's no need for the two of ya ta be brash. If Selh'teus called you to Al'Taieu, then that's where ya should probably be going.${prompt};
I concur.${prompt};
Master, let us head for the mothercrystal.${prompt};
I shall meet you there.${prompt};
${name-player}!?;
${name-player}!${prompt};
I knew it'd take more than that to keep my old pal down!${prompt};
Oh, I'm so glad you made it back safely!${prompt};
Figured it'd take more'n that ta keep ya down!${prompt};
Ya do remember what happened, right?${prompt};
O'er in Al'Taieu you crossed swords with th' ambassador, and he left ya nothin' but a corpse!${prompt};
...Or so I heard. Not like I was actually there ta see th' whole thing.${prompt};
Iroha told us everything.${prompt};
She attempted to call upon Phoenix's power so that you'd return to us.${prompt};
But you started to vanish--your body disappearing into the void.${prompt};
<Sigh> Iroha said her heart skipped a few thousand beats, and it was all we could do to calm her down.${prompt};
Vana'diel is a strange place. Iroha came ta me in my dreams and told me what happened.${prompt};
She tried ta call upon Phoenix's power so that ya'd return to us.${prompt};
She said yer body started to disappear inta th' void.${prompt};
At first I thought it was a bunch of malarkey, but holy mackerel if ya ain't standin' here before us right now.${prompt};
I...I don't know whether to laugh or cry.${prompt};
I don't know whether to laugh or cry!${prompt};
I understand th' feelin'.${prompt};
But I says ta myself, â€œGilgamesh, ain't no way ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] gonna kick th' bucket like that!â€;
So I went out and searched fer ya.${prompt};
That's why I up and sent ya that letter, ${choice: 3}[Aphmau/Nashmeira].${prompt};
I couldn't imagine a greater shock...and so I pulled some strings to get here.${prompt};
And I'm so glad I could see you again!${prompt};
It came as such a shock! But I pulled some strings and had Ovjang shoo people away with vague excuses so that I could rush over here.${prompt};
And I'm so glad I did!${prompt};
So I says ta myself, â€œGilgamesh, ain't no way ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] gonna kick the bucket like that!â€${prompt};
So I sent out letters to everyone I could think of!${prompt};
Let me tell ya--no one's happier 'n me!${prompt};
One of us has gotta up and tell Iroha!${prompt};
...Where'd she go, anyway?${prompt};
Iroha will be so pleased to hear about your recovery!${prompt};
...But where could she have gone off to?${prompt};
I...wish that I knew.${prompt};
I'm certain Iroha would love to hear the news.${prompt};
But if she's not here...then where could she be?${prompt};
We've got to tell Iroha that you're awake!${prompt};
But where'd she go?${prompt};
All that's left is ta tell Iroha th' good news...${prompt};
But no one knows where she went.${prompt};
In my dream, she was in front of the crystal, surrounded by a strange glow.${prompt};
It's got to be related to Reisenjima.${prompt};
In my dream, she was in front o' th' crystal, surrounded by this strange glow.${prompt};
Th' only conclusion we can come ta is that it's got somethin' ta do with Reisenjima.${prompt};
But with all th' Emptiness in the eastern seas, there's no way we can get there.${prompt};
I got Zeid and th' Tenshodo makin' inquiries, seein' if Iroha might be somewhere on the other continents.${prompt};
Oh, don't look so glum.${prompt};
Now that yer with us, th' future's brighter'n ever.${prompt};
You really think so, pops?${prompt};
We can only hope so.${prompt};
It'll be brighter than ever!${prompt};
She's right. Together we can overcome.${prompt};
There's nothing we can't do if we work together!${prompt};
${name-player}, make sure ta come scurryin' back if ya hear anything.${prompt};
You are now able to enjoy a new storyline, A Crystalline Prophecy.;
