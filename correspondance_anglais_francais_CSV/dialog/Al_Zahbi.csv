The fearless Hume over there is the Flameserpent General Gadalar, champion of the Imperial Army.${prompt};(Attendez au salon de thé. Je viendrai une fois ma garde terminée.)${prompt}

Don't let her looks fool you, though... She's the Springserpent General!${prompt};Regardez cette fille. N'est-elle pas mignonne ? Son nom est Mihli Aliapoh.
They say she comes from a nation that is allied to the Empire, and that she is working hard to fulfill her homeland's expectations. I'm behind her all the way!${prompt};Ne vous laissez pas tromper par son apparence... Elle est le Général du Serpent du Printemps !${prompt}
Sh-she's gone... Mihli Aliapoh was taken right from my side as I was fighting... I wasn't strong enough...${prompt};On dit qu'elle vient d'une nation alliée à l'Empire, et qu'elle travaille dur pour répondre aux attentes de son pays d'origine. Je la soutiens à fond !${prompt}
I...I couldn't protect her...${prompt};E-elle est partie... Mihli Aliapoh a été enlevée juste à mes côtés pendant que je me battais... Je n'ai pas été assez fort...${prompt}
See the giant Galka over there? He's the pride of our army--the great Stoneserpent General Zazarg.${prompt};Je... Je n'ai pas pu la protéger...${prompt}
He has an incredible amount of battle experience. He slumbers and eats together with us soldiers, and openly speaks his mind. He is a kind and reliable commander.${prompt};Voyez-vous le géant Galka là-bas ? C'est la fierté de notre armée--le grand Général du Serpent de Pierre, Zazarg.${prompt}
The great Stoneserpent General Zazarg... Deep inside, I believed nothing could defeat him...${prompt};Il a une expérience de combat incroyable. Il dort et mange avec nous, les soldats, et parle ouvertement de ses pensées. C'est un commandant gentil et fiable.${prompt}
But I will not give up. I will conquer my sadness, and defend the Empress and her Empire to the very last man! I am sure that Zazarg would desire for me to do so.${prompt};Le grand Général du Serpent de Pierre, Zazarg... Au fond de moi, je croyais que rien ne pouvait le vaincre...${prompt}
Hey, you!;Mais je n'abandonnerai pas. Je vaincrai ma tristesse et défendrai l'Impératrice et son Empire jusqu'au dernier homme ! Je suis sûr que Zazarg voudrait que je le fasse.${prompt}
You better not step a fraction closer to Lady Najelith.${prompt};Hé, toi !
Commander Najelith may be young, but she is one of the greatest bowmasters in all of Urhguum. She is also the great General of the Galeserpent. You must act with dignity and respect around her.${prompt};Tu ferais mieux de ne pas t'approcher d'un pouce de Dame Najelith.${prompt}
The great Najelith has been taken by the enemy!${prompt};Le commandant Najelith peut être jeune, mais elle est l'une des plus grandes maîtresses d'arc de tout Urhguum. Elle est également la grande Générale du Serpent de la Brise. Vous devez agir avec dignité et respect en sa présence.${prompt}
We may still have a chance, though. The beastmen are known to capture anyone that might be of use and keep them as prisoners...${prompt};La grande Najelith a été capturée par l'ennemi !${prompt}
What is it, mercenary?${prompt};Nous avons peut-être encore une chance, cependant. Les bêtes sont connues pour capturer quiconque pourrait leur être utile et les garder comme prisonniers...${prompt}

You have heard...;Have you heard about the late Emperor Jalzahn?${prompt}
${selection-lines};You have heard...
A few things.;${selection-lines}
...about who?${prompt};A few things.
Then you must have been in shock when he passed away. It was all so sudden...${prompt};...about who?${prompt}
He was one of those rare leaders whose will lined up with that of the people. Compared to him, the current Empress is...well, just a little less agreeable, shall we say? Do not mention so to anyone else, though...${prompt};Then you must have been in shock when he passed away. It was all so sudden...${prompt}
You have never heard of Emperor Jalzahn!?;He was one of those rare leaders whose will lined up with that of the people. Compared to him, the current Empress is...well, just a little less agreeable, shall we say? Do not mention so to anyone else, though...${prompt}
He was Emperor until four years ago, when he left the mortal realm. His wife followed him shortly thereafter.${prompt};Vous n'avez jamais entendu parler de l'Empereur Jalzahn !?
During their lifetimes, the Emperor and Empress often mingled with the people of the Empire, even coming as far as the Commoners' Ward for visits. They were greatly loved by the public, and we always looked forward to seeing them...${prompt};Il était Empereur jusqu'à il y a quatre ans, quand il a quitté le monde mortel. Sa femme l'a suivi peu de temps après.${prompt}
The Astral Candescence gives off a melody called the Astral Wind, unperceivable by the mortal ear.${prompt};De leur vivant, l'Empereur et l'Impératrice se mêlaient souvent au peuple de l'Empire, allant même jusqu'au Quartier des Communs pour des visites. Ils étaient très aimés du public, et nous avions toujours hâte de les voir...${prompt}
How I would love to hear its heavenly chime one day... I wonder if there is a way...${prompt};La Candescence Astrale émet une mélodie appelée le Vent Astral, imperceptible à l'oreille mortelle.${prompt}
That place is called the “Hall of Binding.” The door is always closed, and the place gives everyone the creeps. They say that a great treasure called the “Astral Candescence” is kept there.${prompt};Comme j'aimerais entendre un jour son carillon céleste... Je me demande s'il y a un moyen...${prompt}
Being so secretive just makes people more curious, though...${prompt};Cet endroit s'appelle le “Hall des Liens.” La porte est toujours fermée, et l'endroit donne la chair de poule à tout le monde. On dit qu'un grand trésor appelé la “Candescence Astrale” y est gardé.${prompt}
Right now, it looks like you can go in and have a peek.;Mais être si secret ne fait qu'attiser la curiosité des gens...${prompt}
Not that it's worth it. There's just some big pillar, with no treasure in sight...${prompt};En ce moment, on dirait que tu peux y entrer et jeter un coup d'œil.
I heard a scary-wary story-wory the other day! You see, a long time ago, the Imperial Army went to fight against the Lamiae on Arrapago Reef...${prompt};Pas que ça vaille le coup. Il n'y a juste qu'un grand pilier, sans trésor en vue...${prompt}
And they brought a whole bunchy-wunch of automatons to help them fight... I'm still shiver-wivering...${prompt};J'ai entendu une histoire effrayante il n'y a pas longtemps ! Tu vois, il y a longtemps, l'Armée Impériale est allée combattre les Lamiae sur le Récif d'Arrapago...${prompt}
But then comes the reeeally scary part. The battle automatons were charmed by the Lamiae...${prompt};Et ils ont amené toute une flopée de robots pour les aider à combattre... Ça me donne encore des frissons...${prompt}
Isn't that frighty-wightening? Every last one went crazy for the Lamiae!${prompt};Mais voici le vrai moment effrayant. Les robots de combat ont été ensorcelés par les Lamiae...${prompt}
I don't want to imagine my Truffle being crazy about anyone but me... I think my hearty-weart would just bursty-wurst!${prompt};N'est-ce pas terrifiant ? Ils étaient tous devenus fous des Lamiae !${prompt}
So I've decided to never, ever go near Arrapago Reef. Anyway, I heard Lamiae can charm Tarutaru, too!${prompt};Je n'ose pas imaginer que mon Truffle puisse devenir fou de quelqu'un d'autre que moi... Je pense que mon petit cœur éclaterait juste en morceaux !${prompt}
You better look out too, okay? It's a danger-wangerous world we live in.${prompt};Alors j'ai décidé de ne jamais, au grand jamais, m'approcher du Récif d'Arrapago. De toute façon, j'ai entendu dire que les Lamiae peuvent aussi enchanter les Tarutarus !${prompt}
Lamiae. Scary-wary.${prompt};Tu ferais mieux de faire attention aussi, d'accord ? C'est un monde dangereux dans lequel nous vivons.${prompt}
Only a joke.;Lamiae. Effrayantes.${prompt}
Truffle does not know what Lamiae are.${prompt};Juste une blague.
Empress Nashmeira II appeared at the palace seemingly out of nowhere, and now she reigns over the Empire.${prompt};Truffle ne sait pas ce que sont les Lamiae.${prompt}
Since she took the throne, not a single good thing has happened. Beastman raids are a bronze piece a dozen and nobody feels safe walking the streets of Al Zahbi anymore...${prompt};Empress Nashmeira II est apparue au palais apparemment de nulle part, et maintenant elle règne sur l'Empire.${prompt}
I have heard that she has absolutely no interest in governmental matters, as well. What is to become of our nation?${prompt};Depuis qu'elle a pris le trône, il ne s'est rien passé de bon. Les raids des bêtes sont monnaie courante et personne ne se sent en sécurité en se promenant dans les rues d'Al Zahbi...${prompt}
Until about two hundred years ago, this land belonged to a nation called the “Kingdom of Ephramad,” which prospered in the shipping trade.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire qu'elle n'avait absolument aucun intérêt pour les affaires gouvernementales. Que va devenir notre nation ?${prompt}
Trade between Ephramad and the West flourished until their tiny nation began to equal the Aht Urhgan Empire in wealth and the size of their navy.${prompt};Il y a environ deux cents ans, cette terre appartenait à une nation appelée le “Royaume d'Ephramad,” qui prospérait dans le commerce maritime.${prompt}
The rivalry between the two nations reached a critical point, and the Imperial Army used a power no man should even possess... The Kingdom of Ephramad was completely destroyed. I find the Empire's actions absolutely deplorable...${prompt};Le commerce entre Ephramad et l'Occident florissait jusqu'à ce que leur petit pays commence à rivaliser avec l'Empire Aht Urhgan en richesse et en taille de leur marine.${prompt}
My homeland, the Marquisate of Tavnazia, was destroyed in a beastman attack roughly twenty years ago. I was in Al Zahbi at the time...${prompt};La rivalité entre les deux nations a atteint un point critique, et l'Armée Impériale a utilisé un pouvoir qu'aucun homme ne devrait posséder... Le Royaume d'Ephramad a été complètement détruit. Je trouve les actions de l'Empire absolument déplorables...${prompt}
Although we were allies, the former Emperor threw the ambassador out of town without so much as a word of condolence. I have never seen such a disgrace in my entire life!${prompt};Ma patrie, le Marquisat de Tavnazia, a été détruite lors d'une attaque des bêtes il y a environ vingt ans. J'étais à Al Zahbi à l'époque...${prompt}
Since Grand Vizier Razfahd began working to restore peace on the streets of the Imperial capital, Al Zahbi has been gradually changing for the better.${prompt};Bien que nous étions alliés, l'ancien Empereur a expulsé l'ambassadeur de la ville sans même un mot de condoléances. Je n'ai jamais vu une telle honte de toute ma vie !${prompt}
The beastman invasions are still the same, but theft and other crimes have gone down. Thanks to the Grand Vizier, business is better than ever!${prompt};Depuis que le Grand Vizir Razfahd a commencé à travailler pour restaurer la paix dans les rues de la capitale impériale, Al Zahbi change progressivement pour le mieux.${prompt}
My younger brother went missing after a beastman attack once. I was sure I would never see his smiling face again...${prompt};Les invasions des bêtes sont toujours les mêmes, mais le vol et les autres crimes ont diminué. Grâce au Grand Vizir, les affaires vont mieux que jamais !${prompt}
But the other day, I got a letter from him! Would you like to hear what it says? Just listen!${prompt};Mon petit frère a disparu après une attaque des bêtes une fois. J'étais sûr de ne jamais revoir son visage souriant...${prompt}
“To my dear sister,;Mais l'autre jour, j'ai reçu une lettre de lui ! Voulez-vous entendre ce qu'elle dit ? Écoutez donc !${prompt}
Don't worry about me. The Mamool Ja are treating me like a king. I've got everything I ever wanted!${prompt};“À ma chère sœur,
“Mamook is a paradise. I'm so glad I studied blacksmithing!”${prompt};Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi. Les Mamool Ja me traitent comme un roi. J'ai tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu !${prompt}
I've decided to forget about my brother. There's just one thing I'm still curious about, though...${prompt};“Mamook est un paradis. Je suis si content d'avoir étudié la forge !”${prompt}
What is he using his blacksmithing skills to make there?${prompt};J'ai décidé d'oublier mon frère. Il y a juste une chose qui m'intrigue encore...${prompt}
Thwee cheers for the Empwess!${prompt};Que fabrique-t-il là-bas avec ses compétences de forge ?${prompt}
Don't I sound stwong? Just like an Imper-eel soldier, wight?${prompt};Thwee huzzahs pour l'Empwess !${prompt}
Imper-eels are weally cool, but Serpent Generals are even cooler!${prompt};Ne suis-je pas fowte ? Tout comme un soldat Impéwiel, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Someday I wanna see them do their magic. They can make a “seal,” you know? I don't know what that is, but I'd like to see it!${prompt};Les Impew-iiels sont weally cool, mais les Généwaux du Sèwpent sont encore plus cool !${prompt}
But whenever I twy, my papa wuns after me and dwags me back home without any supper...${prompt};Un jour, je veux les voir faire leur magie. Ils peuvent créer un “sceau,” tu sais ? Je ne sais pas ce que c'est, mais j'aimerais le voir !${prompt}
I simply cannot bring myself to like the whole idea of working as a mercenary for mere riches.${prompt};Mais chaque fois que j'essaie, mon papa me court après et me ramène à la maison sans aucun souper...${prompt}
Perhaps I am just biased, but I cannot help but feel that mercenaries lack the conviction to protect this town.${prompt};Je ne peux tout simplement pas me résoudre à aimer l'idée de travailler comme mercenaire pour de simples richesses.${prompt}
The volunteer soldiers seem very admirable in comparison. They risk their very lives to protect the town where they were raised!${prompt};Peut-être que je suis juste partial, mais je ne peux m'empêcher de sentir que les mercenaires manquent de conviction pour protéger cette ville.${prompt}
Such nice boys and girls... I'd like to bake them a pie.${prompt};Les soldats volontaires semblent très admirables en comparaison. Ils risquent leur vie pour protéger la ville où ils ont été élevés !${prompt}
Aht Urhgan, land of the courageous...${prompt};De si gentils garçons et filles... J'aimerais leur faire une tarte.${prompt}
I used to have confidence in my strength, and I came to this nation to test my skill. But you could not pay me enough to face the ferocious beastmen here...${prompt};Aht Urhgan, terre des courageux...${prompt}
Still, I can't go running home now, or everyone will think I am a coward! How do I get myself into these messes...?${prompt};J'avais autrefois confiance en ma force, et je suis venu dans cette nation pour tester mon habileté. Mais vous ne pourriez pas me payer assez pour affronter les féroces bêtes ici...${prompt}
This “Bastion” is the best place in town to stage a defensive against invading beastmen. During an attack, we retreat to this area and bring the savages down as they rush in from the drawbridges.${prompt};Pourtant, je ne peux pas rentrer chez moi maintenant, sinon tout le monde pensera que je suis un lâche ! Comment est-ce que je me mets dans ces situations... ?${prompt}
You have arrived at North Gate.;Ce “Bastion” est le meilleur endroit en ville pour organiser une défense contre les bêtes envahissantes. Pendant une attaque, nous nous retirons dans cette zone et abattons les sauvages alors qu'ils se précipitent depuis les ponts-levis.${prompt}
