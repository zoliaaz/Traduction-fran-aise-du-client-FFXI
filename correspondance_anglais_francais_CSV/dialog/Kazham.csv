Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”

You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}

Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
