What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Conquests.;
Conquest results.;
Donating crystals.;
Conquest points.;
The effects of controlling regions.;
Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};
Where do you wish to take the supplies?;

We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations.;
Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.${prompt};
We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign.;
You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.${prompt};
Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race!;
Here is a small token of our appreciation.${prompt};
Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.${prompt};
You cannot currently purchase this item.;
Please choose another.${prompt};
Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.${prompt};
Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of ${number: 5} members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.${prompt};
Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.${prompt};
There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.${prompt};
Join the E.F. in ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?;
${selection-lines};
Join the E.F.;
Not this time.${prompt};
Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.${prompt};
One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.${prompt};
One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.${prompt};
One of your party members is below level ${number: 6}. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.${prompt};
I see that you are ready.;
I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.${prompt};
Are you ready to be teleported to ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.${prompt};

This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.${prompt};
Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.${prompt};
Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.${prompt};
You received ${number: 1} conquest points!${prompt};
When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.${prompt};
I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties.;
Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.${prompt};
You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.${prompt};
The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.${prompt};
You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!${prompt};
Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.${prompt};
We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.${prompt};
Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt};
You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt};
Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt};
Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt};
Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt};
Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt};
Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt};
Your inventory is full. You could not accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.${prompt};
I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, ${name-npc}. My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.${prompt};

I'm going to become a fearless bounty hunter, and leave the poor, fragile, little me behind forever.${prompt};
And besides, Papa probably hasn't even noticed I'm gone. He didn't even remember my birthday.${prompt};
That's not true, kupopo!${prompt};

But I can't go back.;
Please tell Zoriboh it's not his fault I left Rabao, and not to fret for me.;
I'll be just fine.${prompt};
“Just fine!?”;
Run-ins with pirates, smugglers, and a vortex of darkness, and she says “just fine,” kupopo!${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Please let Mister Zoriboh know that Sanctia is okay, kupopo.${prompt};
I'll do my best to see that she stays “just fine,” kupopo!${prompt};
What in Altana's name are you doing here?${prompt};
Me? I have come to collect ingredients to make medicine.${prompt};
You say Parelbriaux visited this spot as well?${prompt};
But why would he...?${prompt};

Parelbriaux may be obnoxious at times but...${prompt};
...but if anything terrible were to befall him...${prompt};
Oh, I heard from Ondieulix that you were searching for my bag.${prompt};

Maybe Ondieulix was right.${prompt};
Maybe adventurers are not all that bad...${prompt};
A message has been engraved into the rock:;
“Offer up the ancient shield, and the pact shall be honored.”${prompt};
Very well, I shall test thy mettle...${prompt};
I am Amaltheia the Omnipotent.;
My almighty horns shall seal thy fate this day!${prompt};
Nothing happens...${prompt};
The stench of rotten flesh fills the air around you.;
Some scavenger must have made this place its territory.${prompt};
You set ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} on the ground. The smell becomes almost unbearable.;
Suddenly, a huge creature approaches and starts sniffing around!${prompt};
Nothing happens.${prompt};
Kurrea slurps down the ${color: 5}adamantoise soup${color: 1}!${prompt};

Kurrea's face has turned green...${prompt};
Hey, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Have you heard?;
The wyrms that were circling above Tavnazia have disappeared.${prompt};
It's all over.;
The town has finally found peace again.${prompt};
I haven't seen Miss Mildaurion for a while, but she did send a messenger.;
Looks like Jeuno is willing to continue supporting the safehold.${prompt};
Unlike Nag'molada's flimsy promises, with this arrangement we'll be able to govern ourselves.${prompt};
I have never seen Granpere so excited.;
He plans to hire adventurers to exterminate all the fiends, and then sow fields in Lufaise and Misareaux.${prompt};
He also intends to restore the shepherd villages on Cape Riverne, although a great deal of the land yet floats high above the sea in that unnatural way...${prompt};
Once the people of Tavnazia have regained their strength and spirit, we will rebuild the Marquisate and reclaim our lives.${prompt};
No longer shall our homes be overrun by monsters.${prompt};
Sure, the dragons are gone, but we've still got a lot of work to do.${prompt};
And don't you give me that sympathetic look.;
You adventurers will have plenty of opportunities to pitch in.${prompt};
You must not give in to the lure of battle, Prishe.${prompt};
We need you to focus on becoming the leader of the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt};
Wha--!?;
I'm off to get my workout!${prompt};
Later!${prompt};
Prishe...!${prompt};
When I dwell on events, it seems we have done nothing but cause you trouble.${prompt};
And yet you have stood by us through it all.;
We are truly grateful.${prompt};
And should the opportunity arise, we would greatly appreciate any further assistance you could provide for the Marquisate.${prompt};
However...;
I understand that as an adventurer, there is still much in the world you wish to experience.${prompt};
If you ever feel the need to rest your wings, we will always welcome you here in Tavnazia.${prompt};
I hope we may meet again, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Hey, you found me!${prompt};
Have you been here before, ${name-player}?;
You can see for malms.${prompt};
You can get a great view of the town where I was born--where the end of the world was born.${prompt};
All I've ever thought about is what the apocalypse would be like.${prompt};
If I manage to live out this eternal life, I guess I'll eventually find out.${prompt};
"It doesn't matter how--the rebirth of Promathia; the awakening of the sleeping gods; the victory of the beastmen.${prompt}";
The world will end.;
And when that happens, even my immortal existence will be snuffed out.${prompt};
When I stood before that gate, Promathia promised to show me the apocalypse.${prompt};
That was when I realized who most wanted to see the end of it all--who couldn't wait for the grand finale.${prompt};
That person was me.${prompt};
That's why I hurled that black magicite into the Twilight God.${prompt};
I somehow hoped that by sending it into the mothercrystal with the soul of Promathia, the Keeper of the Apocalypse would one day rise again.${prompt};
Miss Mildaurion didn't yell at me.${prompt};
She just smiled and said, “Wait until you meet ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].”${prompt};
What did she mean?;
Is your hatred of me meant to be my punishment?${prompt};
Do you think so?;
${selection-lines};
Nod.;
Shake your head.${prompt};
I thought so.;
That must be why I hurt inside.${prompt};
No, really.;
That must be why I hurt inside.${prompt};
Why now?;
I've been the target of a lot of abuse over the years, and it's never bothered me.${prompt};
But for some reason, you just standing there quietly is more than I can bear.${prompt};
And it's not like being kicked, or punched, or stabbed.${prompt};
I can't get a handle on it.;
It's frightening and unnerving.;
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.${prompt};
You're just a mortal, right?${prompt};
Then how can you close your heart off to me?${prompt};
Are you sad?;
Do I make you sad?${prompt};
Is it too difficult?;
Am I too difficult to deal with?${prompt};
Don't you want to open your heart to me?${prompt};
What the hell is this feeling?;
What the hell is going on...?${prompt};
You and I feel the same way.;
That's why I can't read you. We share the same soul.${prompt};
No, it's not that I can't read you, it's because I've become the same as you...${prompt};
The magicite in my chest...;
It's gone...${prompt};
Has my magicite...melted away...?${prompt};
I know what's happened...;
I've gotten it back...${prompt};
The thing that makes us mortal...;
The Emptiness...${prompt};
I'm mortal again.;
That's why I feel so much pain.${prompt};
...Damn.;
Being mortal sure is complicated.${prompt};
I'm in pain, but I'm happy.${prompt};
It hurts, but I can smile.${prompt};
That's why I can tell you from the depths of my being...${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I can go on now.${prompt};
Not simply wait for the end, but be just like everyone else...${prompt};

The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};
