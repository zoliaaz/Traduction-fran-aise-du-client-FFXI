Hello.;
I haven't seen you around here beforrre. Are you new in town?${prompt};
Are you new to Mhaura?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, it's my first time here.;
No, I've come here plenty of times.${prompt};
Ah, I thought so. Welcome to Mhaura.;
You should go to the governor's house. They'll tell you all you need to know about our little town.${prompt};
First, climb the stairs there, and walk along the ledge to another set of stairs. Go up, and you're therrre.${prompt};
You're not pulling my tail, are you? Hmm...I guess I must've just missed you. Still, you look lost.${prompt};
Have you been to the governor's house yet? If not, you should. They'll tell you all you need to know about our little town.${prompt};
Hello, therrre.;
I don't believe I've seen you before.;
You must be new in town.${prompt};
I thought so. Welcome to Mhaura! Visitors like you should go to the governor's house to get an orientation.${prompt};
Go up the stairs at the western end of this square, then up again the stairrrs on your left. Good luck!${prompt};
Rrreally? I'm sorry. I'm usually good with names...${prompt};
You should visit the governor's house if you haven't already. They will answer any questions you have about Mhaura.${prompt};
Welcome to the governor's house.;
How may I be of assistance?${prompt};
What do you wish to know?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me about Mhaura.;
Any shops or guilds in town?;
Where can I find some work?;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
As you wish.;
Mhaura is a port town situated within the boundaries of the Windurstian Federation.${prompt};
The natural basin here was ideal for building a port. In time, people started building their homes in the surrounding cliffs. Thus Mhaura came to be.${prompt};
Geographically, Mhaura is situated in the southern half of the Buburimu Peninsula in Southeastern Mindartia. Windurst City is southwest of here.${prompt};
From the port, you can board one of the transit ships to Selbina, a town in Central Quon.${prompt};
Lately, there are even ships traveling to a city called Al Zahbi in the Near Eastern Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
As you wish.;
The Blacksmiths' Guild and Goldsmiths' Guild have their salesrooms on the level below us.${prompt};
Across from them spans a bridge leading to a two-story inn called the Sailors' Stay. The reception desk is on the first floor. The armorer, Graine, is also there.${prompt};
Across the Sailors' Stay, on ground level, is the sea travel agency. Ships bound for Selbina and Al Zahbi dock there.${prompt};
To the west of the agency you'll find an antique shop. I should tell you that the owner, Orlando, has some very peculiar tastes...${prompt};
Further west, down a flight of stairs, is the warehouse.${prompt};
Pikini-Mikini, a dealer in goods, and Tya Padolih, a seller of arcane scrolls, have set up shop there.${prompt};
Jobs in Mhaura? Hmm... I believe Lady Take at the Sailors' Stay is the person to talk to about such matters.${prompt};
Have you gone to see Take at the Sailors' Stay yet? She may have something for you.${prompt};
As you wish.;
Please come by anytime if there is something you wish to ask about Mhaura.${prompt};
Welcome to the Sailors' Stay.;
Hm? You're looking for work? Well, I guess we could always use an extra hand...${prompt};
Go talk to our resident cook, Rycharde. He should be around here somewhere.${prompt};
Yeah, I'm Rycharde. Whaddaya want? Miss Take sent you, you say?${prompt};
Lessee... Bring me ${item-plural: 0[2]}. I need two of them for this recipe I “cooked up”...;
Heh-heh, I kill me. So, whaddaya say?${prompt};
Yes, can I help you?;
I'm sorry, I personally don't have any work for you to do. Have you talked to Rycharde?${prompt};
Good! Better hurry up. Time's a-wastin'.${prompt};
Darn.;
Well, if you ever change your mind, come talk to me again, all right?${prompt};
Ready to get back in the kitchen, eh?;
So, you gonna do it? I need two ${item-plural: 0[2]} for my recipe.${prompt};
How's it going? You're not done yet, huh? Well, you know where to find me. Good luck.${prompt};
Hey, wait a second! This isn't enough!;
Come back when you have two, okay?${prompt};
Oh, goodie! Thanks!;
Here's something for your trouble.${prompt};
I've been an apprentice chef for more than three years now, but someday I'll be a first-rate chef!${prompt};
You're training to become a top-notch adventurer yourself, right? Just come to me if you need more work!${prompt};
Hey. Thanks for last time.;
I know I told you I'd give you more work, but I don't really need anything right now. Sorry.${prompt};
Just the adventurer I was looking for!;
I have this order to fill, but I'm missing some ingredients.${prompt};
I need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and I need them delivered within three days. Whaddaya say?${prompt};
Thanks! Remember, I need them within three days! Good luck!${prompt};
No go, huh? Too bad, I guess I'll have to ask someone else. Maybe next time, eh?${prompt};
Go and get those things I asked for, quick! You have ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[hour/hours] left!${prompt};
Do you have them? No? C'mon, hurry up!${prompt};
You got them! They're still fresh, too!;
Thanks so much! Now I know who to ask when I need something!${prompt};
Ah...thanks, but when I saw you wouldn't make it, I asked someone else. Well, since you did bring them, though, I'll give you some gil for your efforts.${prompt};
Let me tell you something about cooking: a dish is only as good as its ingredients. The fresher they are, the better the food.${prompt};
Just remember that next time, okay?${prompt};
Hey, long time no see.;
Remember the last order I got? That was from the governor herself, and she really liked the dish I made for her!${prompt};
She liked it so much, she said she wants me to prepare all her meals from now on!${prompt};
I don't want to disappoint her, so I need you to bring me exotic ingredients to practice my cooking skills!${prompt};
I heard they're pretty hard to get, but I'd like to start with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Whaddaya say?${prompt};
Really? That's great!;
You can take your time with it, just as long as you bring me one. Good luck!${prompt};
Yeah, well, I don't blame you. They're not easy to get. Come back, though, if you change your mind.${prompt};
Back so soon, eh? So, do you think you can find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me?${prompt};
Wow! You got it!;
I have to say, I'm really impressed!${prompt};
Here's your well-deserved reward. Come back in two or three days if you can. I still have some work for you. ${prompt};
So, how's it going? Working hard or hardly working? Take it slow, though. There's no hurry.${prompt};
Rycharde is a good cook. I'm glad to hear you've been working hard to help him. Good luck to you both!${prompt};
There you are!;
I've managed to make a pretty good dish--if I may say so myself--with the ingredient you brought me last time.${prompt};
I know I've been giving you tough jobs so far, so this time I'm going to give you an easy one.${prompt};
All you have to do is take this dish to a man named Valgeir in Selbina. Whaddaya say?${prompt};
All right!;
Go to the port and board the transit ship to Selbina. Here, I'll pay for your travel fare in advance.${prompt};
Oh, when you get back, tell me what Valgeir's reaction was, okay?${prompt};
What? C'mon, it's just a delivery job! I'll even pay your travel fare! Whaddaya say?${prompt};
So, how was it? Did he say anything?;
Oh...you haven't gone yet. Remember, the man's name is Valgeir. Now hurry to Selbina!${prompt};
So, how was it?;
Did he say anything?${prompt};
Tell Rycharde...;
${selection-lines};
Exactly what Valgeir said.;
That Valgeir didn't say anything.${prompt};
He said that!? Damn that old man!;
Will he never admit that I've become as good as him?${prompt};
Really? No, I can tell from your face he did say something, and it wasn't anything good. Thanks for being considerate, but I'm okay with it.${prompt};
Oh...your reward, right. Here.;
I don't think I'll have any work for you for a while... Thanks for your help, though.${prompt};
Oh...it's you.;
Sorry, I don't have any work for you. Give me some time to...recover.${prompt};
Hi, there. You've been working for Rycharde for a while now...do you know what's wrong with him lately? He looks down.${prompt};
What? He sent you to Valgeir?;
Let me guess: he refused to recognize Rycharde's talents again, right?${prompt};
Valgeir is Rycharde's father, and one of the best cooks in Vana'diel. He's also a very strict man, especially to his son.${prompt};
He raised Rycharde to be a great cook like him, but there were some things they could never agree on. In the end, Rycharde ended up leaving home.${prompt};
Rycharde has worked hard and become a very good cook. Valgeir really should give him some credit. Don't you agree?${prompt};
But you know what? I wouldn't mind tasting some of Valgeir's cooking someday. I wonder what it's like?${prompt};
You went and brought me some of Valgeir's cooking? Thank you! I'll have Rycharde taste some of it, too.${prompt};
And here, take these. It's the least I can do.${prompt};
Thank you for working so hard to help Rycharde. I promise I'll have him taste some of his father's cooking.${prompt};
Ah, you're back.;
Ms. Take told me. I want to thank you.${prompt};
As for the old man's cooking...it was incredible. I don't think I would ever be able to make anything like that.${prompt};
But I'm not trying to emulate him. I just want to make him acknowledge my way of cooking, you know? And I need your help to accomplish that.${prompt};
I'd like you to bring me four ${item-plural: 0[2]}. These, again, are hard to find.${prompt};
No deadline. I'll wait until you bring back four of them.;
So, whaddaya say?${prompt};
Great! I knew I could count on you!;
Good luck!${prompt};
That's all right, I understand. It is pretty hard work.;
Just don't hesitate to come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
So, you thought it over? You'll go look for the four ${item-plural: 0[2]} for me?${prompt};
Wow! Thank you!;
I knew you wouldn't let me down!${prompt};
Here, take this, you earned it!;
All right! Now I'll show that old man!${prompt};
Thanks, but...this isn't enough. Could you come back when you find four of them? Good luck!${prompt};
Thanks for bringing some of Valgeir's cooking. It was delicious! I think tasting it really helped Rycharde.${prompt};
Hi! I was waiting for you to come.;
Rejoice! My new dish is done, and I have a job for you!${prompt};
I need you to take it to Valgeir again.;
Whaddaya say, will you do it?${prompt};
So, how was it? Did he say anything? Oh...you haven't gone yet. I'm sure this time he'll be surprised, so go quick!${prompt};
Hmm? He sent you back to give this to me? But it's just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}... What does it mean?${prompt};
Anyway, here, this is your reward.;
Thanks again.${prompt};
Hi again. Thanks for last time!;
I finally got what that ${item-singular: 0[2]} meant!${prompt};
My old man used to make me practice on them when he was teaching me to cook. I would usually mess it up, and he would yell at me for wasting perfectly good ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
For years, he kept yelling at me for every little mistake I made... So one day I left, promising myself I'd show him I could become a good cook without his help!${prompt};
But you know, when I was a kid, my mom used to make the best ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
She wasn't trained like my old man, and she wasn't even using the best utensils...${prompt};
But Mom's ${item-plural: 1[2]} were the best!;
I loved them!${prompt};
That's what this reminded me of, and I realized I had forgotten the most important thing about cooking.${prompt};
I have to get back to the basics. But I'm glad you came along and helped me see my mistake. Thank you!${prompt};
Have you seen Rycharde lately? He seems changed. He has this look of determination I've never seen before.${prompt};
He must've rediscovered something deep inside...something he had long forgotten. I'm glad for him, and it's all thanks to you.${prompt};
What do you want? Yes, I'm Orlando the antiquary, but I don't deal with people who can't ride chocobos. That means you. Go away.${prompt};
Ah! You can ride chocobos, I see.;
I'm Orlando the antiquary. I have a proposal for you, if you're interested.${prompt};
Did you know that some of the Goblins around here hide items in the ground?${prompt};
Find those hiding spots and dig them up with a chocobo. If you're lucky, you might even find something valuable.${prompt};
But most of it will be junk. That's where I come in. Bring the junk to me and I'll buy them off you.${prompt};
I only buy items in bunches of eight, though, so only come if you have enough. Of course, the amount I'll pay depends on what you bring.${prompt};
Good hunting, then!;
But be careful. There are things worse than Goblins out there!${prompt};
Let's see what you've brought... ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, eh? I'll give you ${number: 0} gil for them. Come back when you've dug up some more!${prompt};
Hmm? It seems like you can't carry anything else. Come back when you've lightened your load.${prompt};
This isn't enough. I told you, I only buy items in bunches of eight. Come back when you have enough, all right?${prompt};
So, how goes the hunt?;
Bring me eight of the same items and I'll buy them off you. I'll pay more if their quality is good. Good luck!${prompt};
People call me a “junk collector,” but they're just a bunch of ignoramuses. Only connoisseurs like me can appreciate the true value of what I have.${prompt};
Oh... Hello.;
I'm waiting for my husband. He's a sailor. I'll be fine. I'm used to waiting.${prompt};
Hey, she's back again...;
Every day, she stands there and waits for her husband to return.${prompt};
Yeah, breaks me 'eart to see 'er. How long's it been since he disappeared, ya think? Word is, pirates got 'im.${prompt};
Yeah... If it was them, there's no chance in hell he's still alive. Poor woman.${prompt};
He will come back. I know it.;
I'll be fine. I'm used to waiting...${prompt};
Mother? You're here again!?${prompt};
I know how you feel, Mother, but you have to let him go!${prompt};
What are you talking about, Celestina?;
Your father will soon be home.${prompt};
He's just late, that's all.;
His boat's not too far. I know it.${prompt};
Mother!;
How long have you been saying that!?${prompt};
Just stop it!;
I don't want to hear it anymore!${prompt};
What is wrong with that girl? Oh, she's probably just excited to see her father after all this time.${prompt};
Oh, you're the one from the pier...;
I must apologize about my mother.${prompt};
My father was a sailor...;
No one has seen him or his ship for over a year. People are saying the pirates got him.${prompt};
My mother has to move on...;
If only she could be convinced that Father won't be coming back...${prompt};
I'd like to believe that he's still alive somewhere... But we can't go on like this. Not anymore.${prompt};
Can you...that is, if it's not too much to ask... Would you help me convince my mother?${prompt};
Help Celestina?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Really?;
Oh, thank you!${prompt};
There's something that Father told me once that might help us. He said that the ${item-singular: 0[2]} he wore was very rare.${prompt};
And I recently met a sailor who said he saw a pirate wearing one!${prompt};
Could you bring me that ${item-singular: 0[2]}? If it is really Father's...I think Mother and I can finally move on.${prompt};
Please!;
Take back Father's ${item-singular: 0[2]} from that pirate!${prompt};
I see...;
If you ever change your mind...I'll be here.${prompt};
You... You got it.;
So the pirates really...${prompt};
I've thought long and hard since we last spoke, and I've decided to stand by Mother's side and believe in Father's return.${prompt};
Celestina, the sea's very...;
Oh, we have a guest...?${prompt};
Mother!?${prompt};
Th-that ${item-singular: 1[2]}!;
Where did you...?${prompt};
From a pirate...!?;
Then he's really...${prompt};
No, Mother!;
Listen, I...${prompt};
I knew...I knew there was no hope. I knew he wasn't coming back, but I couldn't...${prompt};
Waiting isn't hard...compared to the pain that comes when you stop hoping. I didn't want to see it! I wanted to wait for him, forever!${prompt};
Mother, please! Listen to me!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Even if a pirate had this, it doesn't necessarily mean Father's gone!${prompt};
I'll believe...;
I'll wait with you. So please, don't close your eyes on reality.${prompt};
We must look at the facts, and still keep faith. Father will return safely. We must believe, together.${prompt};
Celestina...${prompt};
Father's safe. I know it!;
He'll be back soon, I'm sure!${prompt};
Yes...;
You're right. The pirates must have attacked his ship...${prompt};
But he must've escaped. He's always been lucky.;
I'm sure he's trying to find a way to come back as we speak!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Thank you for bringing the amulet. Here, it's not much, but I want you to have this.${prompt};
We'll be fine, thanks to you. Father will be coming back soon, I know it.${prompt};
Hello again.;
Thank you for helping us. Hm? What am I still doing here?${prompt};
It's a funny story, really. The people who work here told me it's just not the same without me around.${prompt};
So I've decided to stand here and pray for the safety of all who make their living out on the sea.${prompt};
May the sea be kind to those who venture out in her realm...${prompt};
Eh? What have we got here? A fledgling adventurer! I have no business with the likes of you!${prompt};
I'm Nereus, the best potter here in town! You must be a seasoned adventurer, are you not?${prompt};
Well, uh...;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I am!;
No, not really.${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh. A confident one! Good, good! You remind me of me when I was young!${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh. Modest, are we? You don't have to be. I may be old, but I'm not blind.${prompt};
I have a task that I can only ask one such as you. Interested?${prompt};
Interested?;
${selection-lines};
What is it?;
I'm too busy.${prompt};
I'm glad you asked.;
You see, I've been making pottery in this town for as long as I can remember... I'm what they'd call an artisan.${prompt};
I've used clay from nearby areas in my work for many years, but I've been favoring clay from the Gusgen Mines lately.${prompt};
The thing is, though, a bunch of fiends seem to have made those mines their home, and traders haven't been able to get any ${item-plural: 0[2]} out of there.${prompt};
It wasn't so hard to get some a few years back... You have to understand, to an artisan like myself, getting that clay is a matter of life and death.${prompt};
So...I need a stalwart adventurer like you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. I've heard you can find it deep within the mines.${prompt};
Just make sure to get a map so you don't get lost in there. Good luck!${prompt};
You're too busy, eh? Well, then...come back when you have time.${prompt};
Yes? Did you forget something? Please get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as soon as you can. Those mines are dangerous, though, so you take care, eh?${prompt};
Oho! Well done!;
A genuine ${item-singular: 1[2]}, at last! Here's something for your troubles. Heh-heh.${prompt};
Ah, you've come back!;
I need another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Can you go get some for me?${prompt};
Very good!;
Remember, it's in those mines I told you about before. Be careful, eh?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
Thanks, but I have enough for now.;
Come back later. I may need some more then.${prompt};
Eh? What does an adventurer like you want with me? Shouldn't you be out fighting beastmen, bringing peace to the world and all that?${prompt};
Eh? Another fledgling adventurer? There seem to be more and more of you people these days.${prompt};
I may be able to teach you a thing or two... Interested?${prompt};
I'm glad you are. But I won't talk for free. Why don't you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for starters, eh?${prompt};
Not that I'd be terribly upset with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, provided you could get your hands on one.${prompt};
Bring her what she wants?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Maybe later.${prompt};
Good. I'll be waiting here.${prompt};
Oh? It's for your own good, you know...${prompt};
Oh? Your loss, then.;
It's something you really should know...${prompt};
Where can you find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Well...you'll just have to look for yourself. Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
Hoh-hoh.;
Yes, this is what I asked for. I'm ready to talk now.${prompt};
So, you see... Oh, dear. What was I going to say? I forget so many things these days.${prompt};
Hmm...you know, I heard ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is good for your memory.${prompt};
If you bring me some, I might remember what I was trying to tell you. Would you go look for some?${prompt};
Thank you.;
I'll try to remember on my own in the meantime.${prompt};
That's too bad for you.;
I'm sure whatever I was going to tell you would've helped you a lot. Are you sure you won't go?${prompt};
Ah! Yes, this is it. But I managed to remember without it. Hoh-hoh. Now, listen close...${prompt};
Have you ever seen people use abilities from jobs other than their main one? Those people are using something called “support jobs.”${prompt};
And if you can't use support jobs, you don't deserve to be called an adventurer! But I can help you with that. Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
It's all up to you, but if you do want me to teach you...you'll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} first.${prompt};
Hmm... I see you've got some vim after all. You may become a real adventurer yet. Hoh-hoh. All right, I'll teach you about support jobs as I promised.${prompt};
You can add a support job to your main one wherever you can change jobs. Of course, it has to be a job you've already acquired.${prompt};
But whatever you choose as your support job, its effective level will never exceed half that of your main one. Your support job won't benefit from any experience points you gain, either. It is, after all, only meant to be supplemental.${prompt};
Let me give you an example: Let's say you've achieved level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. If you choose warrior as your main job and white mage as your support job, the following will occur...${prompt};
Your warrior level stays the same at 20, and your effective level in white mage also stays at 10--half the level of your main job. In this case, both jobs function to the fullest in their roles.${prompt};
Now, say you choose the same white mage job as your main one and put your warrior job as your support job...${prompt};
Your white mage level is still 10, but the effective level of your warrior job drops to 5, half the level of your main job. Now, that's a lot of wasted potential, isn't it? Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
And selecting a job with a level less than half of your main one as your support job isn't going to do you much good, either. Make sure you're using your jobs to their fullest when choosing support jobs.${prompt};
As to which job is best suited to your main job...ideally, it should be one that either covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.${prompt};
...That's about it.;
Is everything clear?${prompt};
Do you understand how support jobs work?;
${selection-lines};
Got it.;
Can you run that by me again?${prompt};
Good. Then why are you still here? Go try it out, already! And don't forget to thank me when it saves your skin. Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
Oh, you again.;
You must've thought I was asking you to bring me those things out of greed. Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
But you realize I was only testing you to see if you could actually get them. I used to be in the Market...Mooseket...Muskewhatchamacallits before, you know?${prompt};
You look dubious. I did teach you how to use support jobs, didn't I? Well, you're free to believe whatever you want, but what you have now is real power. Use it wisely. Hoh-hoh.${prompt};
You can now use support jobs!${prompt};
I heard once that old Vera was a warrior of some renown when she was young. It's before my time, of course, so I don't know if it is true.${prompt};
And by her age, I'd say anyone who could testify to the veracity of that rumor would be long gone.${prompt};
Fishing is an art...;
I have nothing to say to one who has never held a fishing rod in his life.${prompt};
Ah, I see you have dabbled in the art of fishing...${prompt};
But you still have a long way to go. Come back when you've managed to catch some bigger game.${prompt};
Tell me...do you remember all the catches you've made until now? Do you wish to know?${prompt};
Do you want to know your fishing history?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Of course you do. As would all practitioners of the art.${prompt};
But no one can keep track of all their catches. Except for me. I can even tell you of your past achievements...for a price.${prompt};
I only ask you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. A small price to pay for such information, isn't it?${prompt};
You've brought it.;
Very well, I will tell you.${prompt};
You've cast your line ${number: 1} time${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] and made ${number: 2} catch${choice-plurality: 2}[/es].${prompt};
The biggest fish you caught by size was ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} measuring ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[ilm/ilms], and the biggest fish you caught by weight was ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} weighing ${number: 5} ${choice-plurality: 5}[ponz/ponzes].${prompt};
If you want me to tell you again, then just come see me.;
I'll be waiting here.${prompt};
If you want me to tell you about your past catches, bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I see...;
You may not want me to do so now, but you will eventually. You know where to find me.${prompt};

Ah! Are you from the Rhinostery?${prompt};
You're not? Spitting dhalmels! I wish they would hurry-wurry!${prompt};
Could you come back when it's dark?;
I know it's a bother-wother, but I was specifically instructed not to take it out during the day.${prompt};
Oh, you're the person from the Rhinostery? I've been waiting for you!${prompt};
I guess it's a really important parcel-morsel. I had to follow all these rules when I was handling it! Thankfully, it's really small, so it was easy to carry.${prompt};
I hear you have some pretty strict restrictions you have to follow, too. You should leave immediately, and don't get distracted on the way to the Rhinostery!${prompt};
Ah! Nice to see you again! Did you manage to deliver that parcel-morsel on time?${prompt};
I'm Ekokoko, the governor of this little town. There isn't much to see, but you're welcome to stay as long as you want.${prompt};
If there is anything you wish to know about Mhaura, ask my aide, Numi Adaligo. She's right over there.${prompt};
It's tough getting enough food to feed everyone these days, with all those monsters prowling the areas near the town.${prompt};
Really, we're not slackin' off. Ever since th' airship shippin' routes opened, hasn't been much fer guys like us to do, ya know?${prompt};
I'm bored...;
Maybe I should move to a city in a country with a little more life. Say, how're things where you come from?${prompt};
Welcome!${prompt};
入港中（750フレーム）${wait-animation: 10}${prompt};
Accept this request?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
This is a small town, but we get a lot of traffic because of the port. We have to stay alert and try to stop trrrouble before it starts.${prompt};
Port guard duty's pretty tough work. Of course, it's best when we don't have anything to do. It means Mhaura's safe.${prompt};
I can't let you through this door. This is the guards' barrrracks. No unauthorized people allowed.${prompt};
You can't tell if you're in the town, but I hearrr the beastmen are up to something out there. How are things where you come from?${prompt};
I am Hyria, the captain of the guard here in Mhaura. My duty is to protect the governor from harm.${prompt};
You can see the whole of the harbor and town from here. I like watching the port especially. There are so many different kinds of people getting on and off the ships there.${prompt};
You may not believe me, but before airships started to fly, this inn was packed all year round.${prompt};
Those days are long past, and this town is a little on the dingy side now, but we Mhaurans haven't changed. Some of us have our quirks, but we all still welcome travelers with open arms.${prompt};
Welcome to the Sailorrr's Stay!;
If you need armor or shields, we got those, too! Just talk to Graine here, and she'll show you our wares!${prompt};
And if you need weapons, go see Runito-Monito upstairrrs! He's got the meanest weapons this side of the Bastore Sea!${prompt};

Didn't you say you were going to do some otherrr job before?${prompt};

Oooh! I'll do that job!;
It's purrrfect for me! I love singing!${prompt};
Uh...;
Liking it and being good at it are two different thing-wings...${prompt};
I heard there's a job with long-rains whippings and trakking and deetection!${prompt};
Long-rains...what?;
What kind of job is that!?${prompt};
Oh, I know! You're talking about rangers! My mom said the famousest ranger is a Mithra, like me!${prompt};

I know! I'm gonna-wanna be a knight someday!${prompt};

That'll neverrr happen...${prompt};
When I grow up, I wanna-gonna be a knight and a ranger and a...uh...beesmaster!${prompt};
When I grrrow up, I want to be a bride, and wear the most beautiful wedding dress everrr! But I'm not marrying anyone who wants to become a “beesmaster”!${prompt};
Sir Nereus here is the foremost authority on ceramics, and I came all the way from San d'Oria to become his student, but...Sir Nereus is a hard man to please.${prompt};
As you can see, ceramics is one of Mhaura's main exports. I'm glad I always have work as a longshoreman, but I wish they'd stop making me carry all the heavy ones...${prompt};
Hm?;
If you're looking for the item seller, he's in that warehouse right over there.${prompt};
Hello, did you know?;
They say that pirates of old hid a great treasure in a room somewhere in the Maze of Shakrami.${prompt};
Pirates in those days were very much different from the ones we have now, but pirates are pirates. They're all scary!${prompt};
Apparently, the pirates disguise their ship to look just like a ferry! You should be careful when you travel by sea between Mhaura and Selbina.${prompt};
I've always wondered...where do pirates live? I mean, they can't always be living on their ship. They must have a base somewhere...${prompt};
The old woman who's always standing in front of the warehouse gives me the heebie-jeebies, but for some reason a lot of people come to see her. I wonder why?${prompt};
Mister Orlando likes to collect the strangest things! He can't blame people if they call him a junk collector!${prompt};
I've seen a lot of tough-looking adventurers come to Mhaura to see Mister Nereus. Are you here to see him, too?${prompt};
Bihoro-Guhoro here says he knows all there is to know about pirates...but apparently he hasn't met any yet. Funny, isn't it?${prompt};
Hello there, I'm Graine the armorer.;

I'm tired of always being on the move. I just want to settle down somewhere and take it easy in my twilight years.${prompt};
Ah yes, I remember you.;
You were one of the thieves from the Tenshodo gathering. Isn't this a coincidence?;
What business have you in Mhaura?${prompt};
Hmm?;
You say you have something to ask me?${prompt};
I'll tell you right up front. If you want me to help you in the Atarefaunet treasure hunt, I'll need to know the names of the people working with you.${prompt};
I seem to have been a little hasty in my judgment. So many of our fellow thieves are falling over each other out there trying to find that treasure.${prompt};
Well, this is unexpected. You want me to tell you the name signed on the papers I handed in for that last job?${prompt};
...I must apologize, but I can't seem to remember it too clearly.;
I wonder why that is?${prompt};
I may be able to jog my memory if you do me a favor. Go to Garlaige Citadel and defeat a particularly nasty bomb that is hiding up in the ceiling.${prompt};
Find the holes in the ceiling and try burning this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} underneath them. The bomb should be smoked out of its hiding place.;
Defeating it should be a walk in the park for an adventurer like you.${prompt};
...One more thing. I'm going to need some evidence that you've really defeated the bomb. According to rumor, that particular bomb should drop ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
If you bring that back to me, I'll make more of an effort to recall what you want to know.;
Good luck.${prompt};
Defeat the boisterous bomb lurking in the ceiling of Garlaige Citadel and bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} as evidence that the task is done.${prompt};
Find the holes in the ceiling and try burning this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} underneath them. The bomb should be smoked out of its hiding place.${prompt};
Be careful, adventurer.${prompt};
Well done, adventurer. You could make monster extermination a new career.${prompt};
Now that you've completed your task, I seem to have remembered something.;
The signature on my papers was the letter “D.”${prompt};
You know, most thieves are a greedy bunch...your kind is rare. Aren't you salivating over this Atarefaunet treasure like everybody else?${prompt};
No...Your kind is the most dangerous... Have to be careful around you...;
You pretend not to have the slightest interest and then snatch up the prize while everyone's backs are turned...${prompt};
Well, you're not going to fool me. I'm done talking with you, so be on your way.${prompt};
The Tenshodo is treating this talk of the Atarefaunet treasure as just another rumor. To spread this far, though, there must be a kernel of truth to it.${prompt};
If you're going to join the race for the treasure, you might want to hire yourself a bodyguard. Sometimes these things can turn into a bloody free-for-all.${prompt};
The ship bound for Selbina will ${choice: 1}[arrive/depart] in ${choice: 2}[less than an hour/about 1 hour/about 2 hours/about 3 hours/about 4 hours/about 5 hours/about 6 hours/about 7 hours] (${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[minute/minutes] in Earth time).${prompt};

The ship bound for Al Zahbi is now ${choice: 1}[arriving/departing].${prompt};
Old wounds ache on days like these.;
Nobody wants to give in to the march of years, I guess...${prompt};
And you arrre?${prompt};
Weren't you the one under orderrrs from Chieftainness Perih Vashai?${prompt};
The Mithran Tracker from the homeland was here a moment ago.;
She was asking about the incident that occurred twenty years ago concerning the Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe and her daughter...${prompt};
Do you know of the Fire Tribe?;
They are a Mithran tribe that lives on the southern continent.${prompt};
It was some thirty years ago now.;
The chieftainness of that tribe committed the sin of slaying a fellow tribal member.${prompt};
She spent ten years atoning for that sin in the homeland...;
When war broke out here, she escaped from prison, crossing over to this continent with her daughter in tow.${prompt};
At the time, I was performing the dangerous duty of escorting people and supplies between Jeuno and Windurst.${prompt};
One day, a Mithran woman and her child slipped into our company.${prompt};
We set out for Jeuno, not realizing it was the chieftainness and her daughter who had joined us.${prompt};
However, things didn't go as planned.;
We were discovered by a party of Yagudo in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};
The Yagudo quickly overwhelmed us, and we were taken to Castle Oztroja and held as prisoners.${prompt};
The prison of Oztroja was a terrible place. All we could do was shiver in the biting cold.${prompt};
At regular intervals, the Yagudo would come to drag one of us from the prison.${prompt};
Finally, the Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe was taken away, leaving her daughter behind.;
Only the two of us were left...${prompt};
......${prompt};
Not long after that, we were saved by the elite warriors stationed in the Meriphataud Mountains, led by Perih Vashai herself.${prompt};
I took the child back to Jeuno, but she grew thinner by the day from misery and exhaustion.${prompt};
...Her body was interred in the Eldieme Necropolis, along with the remains of the other races who had died in the war.${prompt};
The daughter of the sinner could not be buried in the lands of the Mithra...${prompt};
I go now to check the verrracity of that story, to see for my own eyes the body of Syu Befrathi, daughter of Chieftainness Nhev Befrathi.${prompt};
I have heard from the townspeople that dangerous creatures rrroam the dark hallways of the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt};
It is a place that cannot be entered alone. But of course, I have no intention of giving up on my quarrry.${prompt};
You are one of the brrreed they call adventurers, right?;
Adventurers are said to take on almost any kind of work as long as the pay is good.${prompt};
I will follow after you, keeping out of sight. Clear the path ahead, making for the cemetery in the center of the necropolis.${prompt};
Meet me at the necropolis, and don't be late.${prompt};
Most of the old Mithra living near Windurst are of the southern Fire Tribe.${prompt};
However, they would not harborrr the sinner out of pity. A sin must be atoned for, and this cannot be avoided.${prompt};
It would seem the Mithran Tracker was not satisfied with the way things turned out.${prompt};
I don't believe she can return home without first discovering the whereabouts of the Bow of Light.${prompt};
You must be...;
You are the one who is in the employ of Chieftainness Perih Vashai?${prompt};
The Mithran Tracker appears to be widening her search for information on the Bow of Light.${prompt};
${name-player}, what are you doing here?;
This is my prrroblem, and I'll thank you to keep your paws out of it!${prompt};
You...?${prompt};
That isn't...?;
Then, you must be the one taken in by Heavens Tower...${prompt};
I was told by Chieftainness Perih Vashai that you had information about my past.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Who does this ${item-singular: 1[2]} belong to? The ${item-singular: 1[2]} I carry does not match with the one I received from the chieftainness.${prompt};
It is the earring that was switched for the other when you were but a child.;
...Yes, that is your original ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
...!;
So, it was switched...${prompt};
Yes, by your mother's request...;
To help the sinner's daughter escape, your mother gave her earring to the sinner.${prompt};
And, just to be safe, your earring was also switched.${prompt};
...!!;
Why would my mother do such a thing...?${prompt};
You know the story of the company that was held captive in Castle Oztroja twenty years ago, and how the sinner and her child were with them?${prompt};
Perih Vashai was deeply troubled over whether or not to send the child back to the homeland.${prompt};
One night, the chieftainness came to me. We would report to the homeland that the sinner and her daughter had both perished in Castle Oztroja at the hands of the Yagudo.${prompt};
And for prrroof of her identity...it was necessary to swap the ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Yes. At the time, we were unaware of the scent that lingers on the sinner. We believed that everything would be solved.${prompt};
Using my mother's earring to help the sinner...how can I forgive something like that?${prompt};
All of this was done for the Bow of Light carried by the sinner, rrright?${prompt};
At this point, you wouldn't believe anything I had to say. What I can tell you is...${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you hold, the one that really belongs to you...;
The other half can be found in the Northlands.${prompt};
The Northlands...?;
Where my mother died...?${prompt};
I do not know if the one who holds it still lives.;
I know only that twenty years ago, she traveled with the escort to the Northlands.${prompt};
I have no rrreal desire to see a mother who would leave me to travel to the Northlands, but since I have come this far, I will go.;
Both you and the chieftainness seem to wish it so.${prompt};
${name-player}.;
I have one thing to ask of you.${prompt};
Could you possibly bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}?;
I've heard it's very useful.${prompt};
If you can bring me that, I will tell you a little more of the story.${prompt};
Could you possibly bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}?;
I've heard it's very useful.${prompt};
If you can bring me that, I will tell you a little more of the story.${prompt};
Thank you, adventurer.;
With this in hand, that child's long, hard journey will be made a little easier.${prompt};
Now...;
Let me tell you what really happened those twenty years ago.${prompt};
When we were imprisoned by the Yagudo in the Meriphataud Mountains, only the Fire Tribe chieftainness, Nhev Befrathi, managed to escape.${prompt};
However, this left her daughter, Syu Befrathi, in the clutches of the Yagudo...${prompt};
To save her daughter, Chieftainness Nhev Befrathi ran into the nearby camp of Perih Vashai and her elite warriors.${prompt};
For the chieftainness, this act was akin to jumping right back into prison, but it was the only option she had left for her daughter's rescue.${prompt};
After hearing the words of Nhev Befrathi, Perih Vashai immediately led her warriors on a raid of Castle Oztroja, not waiting for the dawn.${prompt};
The power of the Bow of Light was incredible to behold. Even so, many warriors lost their lives that day.${prompt};
When we finally escaped from the castle, only a handful of warriors remained.${prompt};
In that battle, Chieftainness Perih Vashai lost the light, and Nhev Befrathi, her life.${prompt};
Left behind were the sinner's daughter, Syu Befrathi, and the Bow of Light...;
We did our utmost to deceive everyone.${prompt};
......;
Semih Lafihna must have learned something in the Northlands by now.${prompt};
Please travel to the Northlands and look for a cave near Castle Zvahl.${prompt};
And if you happen to meet someone there, please give her my letter.${prompt};
Please travel to the Northlands and look for a cave near Castle Zvahl.${prompt};
And if you happen to meet someone there, please give her my letter.${prompt};
Has Semih Lafihna discovered who her mother is?${prompt};
This is not a matter that can be resolved with a few simple words from me. The long years have shackled her heart in chains.${prompt};
It will take both time and a strong will for her to free herself from them.${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.${prompt};
Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Yippee! It must be destiny that brought us together!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.${prompt};
I can't talk about it too loudly, but have you ever seen one of those huge crystals?;
They're found all over the world, far into the wilderness, and deep down in dungeons...${prompt};
From those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth.;
Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt};
Well, take a look at this!${prompt};
As a result of our research, we finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt};
Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!;
However, they didn't appreciate being woken up, and attacked us.${prompt};
Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
I'm sure that you could do it!;
Will you help us out with our research? ${prompt};
Take up the challenge?;
${selection-lines};
Bring it on!;
Ah, no, thanks...${prompt};
Wonderful!;
Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will awaken the giant crystal that is found ${choice: 2}[in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are!;
Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from me. Okey-dokey?${prompt};
If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did! ${prompt};
As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again.;
I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...${prompt};
Excuse me!;
If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now is there?${prompt};
Is it true?${wait-36: 1};
You really defeated a prime avatar!?${prompt};
...I see.;
The prime avatar said that to you?;
I wonder what it could mean.${prompt};
...There is no need to understand...;
...You will forget what I have said...${prompt};
Y-you, you're...!?;
...You have power...${prompt};
...Will you allow...that power...;

Um, excuse me, but who were you again?;
Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?${prompt};
Did I already tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst?${prompt};
You are now able to summon ${choice: 2}[Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Hey, Juroro!;
Oh, it's Ildy-Goldy!${prompt};
It's been some time since you made that tuning fork. Are you still researching those giant-viant crystals?${prompt};
Ah, yes, I've asked a veteran adventurer to look into that for me, but ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] hasn't come back yet.${prompt};
...Wait.;
Did ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] come back already?;
...Or did I even ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to do that yet?${prompt};
Vhat's wrong vith you? Pull yourself together, man.;
I don't think the food in this country agrees with you. Or maybe you haven't been getting enough snoozy-vooze time lately?${prompt};
No, it's nothing like that...;
I guess I have been kinda tired lately, though...${prompt};
Vell, no mattaru.;
I'll go take a look. I've been asked to carry out an experiment with the new version of the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of earth${color: 1}.${prompt};
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer, you look like the reliable-viable type. Maybe you can help me out here. Take this ${item-singular: 3[2]} to the Quicksand Caves in the Eastern Altepa Desert.${prompt};
Using my improved tuning fork of earth along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, should allow more people to be drawn into the crystal than using the regular ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Ildy-Goldy is extremely-wemely proficient in hand-to-hand combat, something very unusual among we Tarutaru. He's always high on the list when researchers are looking for a Rhinostery adventurer to accompany them to the wild lands.${prompt};
With his skill, he's likely to defeat the avatar that slumbers within the protocrystal.${prompt};
Please make your way to the Quicksand Caves of the Eastern Altepa Desert and bring the ${item-singular: 5[2]} into contact with the crystal.${prompt};
...By the way...;
You probably want to assist Ildy-Goldy with his experiment, but have you ever thought of doing your own investigation into the protocrystals?${prompt};
Do you want to do your own investigation?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I thirst for knowledge!;
Um, not really...${prompt};
Well, then.;
First, let me introduce myself.${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
You lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!?${prompt};
What a spacey-wacey individual...;
Well, I guess I'll give you a new one.${prompt};
Welcome back.;
Ildy-Goldy returned a little while before. He's been waiting for you.${prompt};
Oh good, you made it back in one piece.;
I'm sorry about before, I was completely-vetely caught up with chasing down Uran-Mafran.${prompt};
I didn't end up collaring him, though. Those mages can be a slippery-vippery bunch...${prompt};
...But at least ve know the reason vhy the researchers have been acting so odd-voddly lately.${prompt};
It vas all his doing.;
Uran-Mafran... He's been erasing everybody's memories.${prompt};
Vhen you get back to Vindurst, could you report this to the principal?${prompt};
I don't know if Principal Koru-Moru vill remember Uran-Mafran, but it's vorth a shot.${prompt};
Urrrrgh...${prompt};
Ah, excuse me!;
I need your help!${prompt};
I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1} from me and took off!${prompt};
I have absolutaruly no obligation to hand over that incredibly difficult-to-make tuning fork to someone so uncooperative towards the Rhinostery's experiment!${prompt};
I beg of you!;
Please go to Fei'Yin and get back the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1}! Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} for your troubles.${prompt};
I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1} from me and took off!${prompt};
Please chase after that knave and take back the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1}!${prompt};
...What's that you say? You'll help me get back the improved tuning fork but you also want to investigate the protocrystal in Fei'Yin?${prompt};
Investigate the crystal in Fei'Yin?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
...Well then, allow me to introduce myself...${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
The improved tuning fork was used by that rougue...?${prompt};
But it didn't work properly?;
Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt};
...Oh dear Goddess...;
Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt};
When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt};
Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt};
Please take this.;
North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?${prompt};
...Well, I must regain my focus and continue with my work...${prompt};
Um, I'm looking for an adventurer to investigate a protocrystal in this area.${prompt};
Investigate?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not right now...${prompt};
Well, then.;
I should start by introducing myself...${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
...We m-m-meet again...;
...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt};
...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions.;
...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?${prompt};
..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?${prompt};
Hahaha...;
...Rather than strength without purpose...;
...you should be seeking...true power...${prompt};
...We m-m-meet...again...;
I shall...fulfill...my charge.${prompt};
The beast...shall claim...its due...${prompt};
I shall...see it...carried out...${prompt};
What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Hrmmm...;
So it's time to use...no...${prompt};
Hello?;
You're an adventurer, right?;
Maybe you can help us out.${prompt};
Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt};
I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt};
But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt};
We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.;
Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt};
Listen, muscle-hussle brain.;
Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt};
Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt};
That's where you come in.;
I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt};
Listen up.;
The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt};
And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt};
...;
Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
You do have a point there...;
I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt};
No, one round could not hurt.${prompt};
You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.;
Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt};
Are you really-dilly sure?;
${selection-lines};
Fork me!;
On second thought...${prompt};
Well, you asked for it!;
Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt};
I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt};
I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.;
Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt};
Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt};
Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt};
Are you sure you are ready?;
${selection-lines};
Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!;
My dog ate my ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}.;

...;
Alacazimzam-scooby-dooby...;
...;
Sha-mone!;
Don't use that excuse on me, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].;
If you want another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, all you have to do ask.${prompt};
If you do not bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]} we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Did you remember to bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
What!?;
You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt};
Ma'am!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt};
...;
Ma'am...${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
(Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)${prompt};
I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another ${item-singular: 1[2]} near a giant crystal.${prompt};
Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.${prompt};
Do you want another ${color: 5}mini tuning fork${color: 1}?;
${selection-lines};
Fork me baby, one more time.;
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Maybe you can help us outaru!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?${prompt};
Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt};
Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt};
Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt};
Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt};
I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.${prompt};
You're ${name-player}, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.${prompt};
The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.${prompt};
According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.${prompt};
After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.${prompt};
Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.${prompt};
One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.${prompt};
I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!${prompt};
I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!${prompt};
Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.${prompt};
You are ${name-player}, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.${prompt};
The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.${prompt};
I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.${prompt};
I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.${prompt};
And one other thing.${prompt};
One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.${prompt};
The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a “kabuto.” Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.${prompt};
You're finally here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief.;
I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.${prompt};
To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.${prompt};
This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.${prompt};
I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...${prompt};
You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.${prompt};
I-it's you...${prompt};
We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.${prompt};
Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.${prompt};
Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...${prompt};
.........${prompt};
He has lost consciousness.${wait-animation: 2};
The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...${prompt};
Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...${prompt};
Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...${prompt};
Now there are none who can stand in my way!${prompt};
What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...${prompt};
You did it!${prompt};
The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.${prompt};
Our ancestors' ${item-singular: 0[2]} has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit's demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.${prompt};
Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away.;
Until we meet again, ${name-player}!${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has been badly damaged...;
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 3[2]} you carry has lost its effectiveness. You may dispose of it now.${prompt};
You've cleared Samurai AF 2!${prompt};

Hey! You look like a well-trrraveled ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]. Have you ever heard of a thing called a ${color: 5}mannequin${color: 1}?${prompt};
You know, they're these life-sized dolls that are used to display clothes and armor. I heard that up until a few years back, you couldn't walk into a guild or tailor shop without running into one. They were all overrr the place!${prompt};
According to my mentor, it wasn't just the looks of a mannequin that set it apart from other dolls, but the crrraftsmanship of the joints that held the parts together.${prompt};
Supposedly, the joints were all crafted by a single master goldsmith whose skills were years ahead of her time. Thanks to her work, the mannequins could be posed in any way thinkable--they were more human than a Hume!${prompt};
Whether it be a stiff suit of armor or a complicated tunic, there wasn't a thing that didn't look naturrral on one of those works of art. Just the thought of making one of my own gets my goldsmithing heart racing.${prompt};
However, as you can see, there's not a mannequin to be found within five thousand malms of this place. Nobody's making 'em and nobody's using 'em. What I can't figure out is why all of 'em disappeared...${prompt};
So!;
You're gonna help me find out how I can make the display dolls.;
Don't give me that look! You'll get your reward.;
How about I make you your own mannequin? How does that sound?${prompt};
Hmm... I already checked the Weavers' Guild in Windurst and they didn't have any mannequins left...${prompt};
But maybe they still have one lying arrround the guild in Selbina!${prompt};
Ah-ha! So there must be some deep, darrrk reason why people stopped crafting mannequins...${prompt};
Good work, ${name-player}.;
But I'm still not satisfied. Hearing all this talk about curses and beastmen just gets me morrre excited! Now I just have to have one of my own!${prompt};
Looking at this catalog you brought back gives a fairrrly good idea of what a mannequin looks like, but it tells me nothing about what materials I'm gonna need.${prompt};
I think we should go on that lead the old lady at the Weavers' Guild gave us.;
Go on! Get your tail over to the Carpenters' Guild in San d'Oria!${prompt};
Diagrrrams!;
With these, I think I'll be able to reproduce the joints.${prompt};
However, without the wooden body parts, we're still in the darrrk. I wonder where we could find some...${prompt};
Unbelievable! You've found all the parts!${prompt};
I'll start on the joints rrright away.;
This might take me a while, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed with the final product.${prompt};
Ta-dah!;
I've done it! I've successfully reproduced the master goldsmith's finest work...well, almost. You can't actually move the joints, but the mannequin still looks great standing strrraight. And just think how marrrvelous a suit of armor will look resting on it!${prompt};
I've learned a lot from making this, and my next work is surrre to be a masterpiece! I still have a ways to go, but soon everyone will be calling me a master goldsmith!;
Oh yeah, you can take this mannequin as your reward. Thanks for all your help!${prompt};
So, how's my mannequin holding up? ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] looks prrretty good, doesn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?${prompt};
You know what I don't under-blunder-stand? You'd think a port town like this would be over-grover-flowing with fresher-fishermen (and women). I guess I'm just not trying hard enough...${prompt};
Broken ro～ds! Broken ro～ds!;
You break 'em, I'll buy 'em!${prompt};
The Flushy-Fishermen's Guild has started a nifty-spifty new rod recycling service.${prompt};
We buy up broken rods from frothy-fisher${choice-player-gender}[men/women] like you, repair them, and sell them back to adventurers traveling about Bibiki-Squeaky Bay.${prompt};
How about it? Would you like to help us out?${prompt};
Recycle your rods?;
${selection-lines};
I'm game.;
Keep your hands off my rods.${prompt};
Well, if you ever have a change of hippity-heart, you know where I'll be!${prompt};
That's the spirit! Now get out there and start snip-snappin' some poles. I'll be waiting here for you!${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing...${prompt};
I just joined the Fussy-Fishermen's Guild and am not quite that good at repairing rods yet (my wood-waddly-working skill's only 16). I still have a lot of trouble fixing the ones with the teeny-tiny little cracks in them.${prompt};
If possible, I'd appreciate it if the poles you bring back were busted clean in two. Thanks, mate-aru!${prompt};
Recently I've been receiving a lot of crabby complaints about how my recycled rods break really easily. I wonder if I'm doing anything wrong when repairing them...${prompt};
If you have the time, do you think you could travel to Bibiki Bay and try to find one of my recycled rods? I have to get to the bare-bottom of this if I want to keep my busy-business going.${prompt};
No no no no no... This would be way too darn difficult for me to repair. I can only fix rods that have been snippity-snapped clean in two.${prompt};
Oh! What a clean break! Even I can fix this guy!${prompt};
Hm?;
Huh?;
What?${prompt};
It looks like some-biddy-body's put a little crickity-crack in this rod to make it easier to brickity-break.;
You didn't do this, did you?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You explain the details of where you obtained the rod.${prompt};
You found it on Purgonorgo Isle? Hmmm... This is not good...${prompt};
If somebody's trying to pull a fast one on the Flubby-Fishermen's Guild's verily-valued customers, our guildmaster's going to have a cat fit. Heads will roll, let me tell you!${prompt};
Anyway, thanks for bringing back the rod. Here's your reward.;
I'll report the dittily-details of this matter to the guild.${prompt};
Thanks to the hard work of you adventurers, my workshop has been overrrflowing with mannequin parts. Unfortunately, as you can see, I don't have much in the way of storage space here. That's why I've decided to start putting the pieces together and sell the finished prrroducts!${prompt};
I was thinking about asking ${number: 2} gil a mannequin. Quite a barrrgain, if you ask me.${prompt};
What? A few yalms over your head?;
Well, you could always exchange your old one for one of my brand-spankin'-new masterrrpieces.${prompt};
I'd still have to charrrge you ${number: 3} gil, though.;

Alrrright! Here you go.;
Sorry that I couldn't ship it to your Mog House.${prompt};
Okay. Well, if you change your mind, you know where I'll be!${prompt};
Trrrade me the goods and I'll see if it's worth exchanging. Oh, and don't forget to have your ${number: 3} gil rrready to pay the difference.${prompt};
Hmmm... It's still in prrretty good condition. I'd have no problem exchanging this for a new mannequin...if you had the ${number: 3} gil I was asking for.${prompt};
Hmmm... It's still in prrretty good condition. For ${number: 3} gil, you can exchange it for a new mannequin.${prompt};
What do you say?;

Hey! I rrremember you. You're that ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who...no, wait... Hm?${prompt};

${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}......;
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't have any.${prompt};

I wouldn't even know where to start looking...${prompt};
Wait a minute... Do you rrremember the stories about how the Orcs would steal mannequin parts? Maybe some of the beasts also stole bottles of the oil...${prompt};
But that's just a hunch. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any rrreal help.${prompt};
Hey, if I ever get any time off, would you take me to where the mannequin crrraftsman lives? I'd love to learn all his techniques!${prompt};
Hey hey! It's my best customer, ${name-player}. No, and I'm not just saying that!${prompt};
Thanks to you and your frrriends, my business is booming! You want a new mannequin, I have all shapes and sizes! You want to trrrade in your old mannequin? I'll give you a grrreat deal!${prompt};
And now, for a limited time only, I'll even customize your mannequin! That's right, for a nominal fee, I'll brrring that piece of wood to life by changing its pose!${prompt};

I can only accept your trrrade-in after you've paid the ${number: 3}-gil difference. Don't worry, I'll be waiting rrright here for you!${prompt};
Trrrading in your old mannequin for a new one? Rrremember, I'll need a ${number: 3}-gil fee.${prompt};
Now let's see...;

Okay, okay. To thank you for the magazine, here's what I'll do. For the low, low price of ${number: 4} gil, I'll change the pose of any of your mannequins to match these sketches.${prompt};
Huh? You want me to do it for frrree? Hey, a lady's got to make a living, you know!${prompt};
Oh, and while you'rrre here, why not buy one of my high-quality mannequins to add to your collection!?${prompt};

Wait up!${prompt};
Where's my sisterrr?;
Wasn't she with you!?${prompt};
Or did you hear that she was taking a ship home from here?${prompt};

I'll be taking the ferry to a nearby port, then boarding a ship bound for Elshimo.;
This is probably the last time I'll see you.${prompt};
Huh. Who would've thought those words would be so hard to say?${prompt};
It must come as quite a relief to you, though. Like a rabbit that has eluded its pursuer.;
Am I right?${prompt};

Going so soon?${prompt};
Your honesty is refreshing.;
Let our farewell be just as uncomplicated as your feelings.${prompt};
What an unusual ${choice: 0}[woman/man] you are.;
But let there be no loose ends with this farewell.${prompt};
I will try to keep this brief.${prompt};
After returning to our homeland, I will make a full report to the queen concerning Promathia, Altana, and the sins of their children.${prompt};
Citing the struggle of people against these sins, I will dispute the crimes of Mildaurion, Prishe, and the wyrms.${prompt};
Finally...;
I will renounce my name as a Mithran Tracker.${prompt};
Whoa!;
What!?;
I have thought long on the reason behind our deception at the hands of Mildaurion and Prishe.${prompt};
While traveling as their companion, they proved to me that there was no other recourse for their actions.${prompt};
Mildaurion and Prishe interfered with our investigation in order to prevent a greater crime from being committed.${prompt};
A Mithran Tracker hunts sin. It is our duty to seek out crimes and dole out punishment.${prompt};
But these crimes I hunt, against whom have they been perpetrated?;
For whose sake am I judging the criminal?${prompt};
As I pondered these questions, these words began repeating over and over in my mind.${prompt};
“The very act of hunting sin creates sin.;
To not hunt sin is also a choice...”${prompt};
But that was...${prompt};
...What our mother used to...${prompt};
This line of thought is anathema for any Mithran Tracker.${prompt};
Part of the reason I wished to battle Promathia was to silence the doubt in my heart.${prompt};
And then I felt it.;
The sense of justice within me.${prompt};
Even if I lose the title of Mithran Tracker, or rather because I will lose it, true justice will be possible.${prompt};
Words cannot explain it.;
It is something you must learn about yourself as you live and grow.${prompt};
Do not lament the fact that you have yet to learn this truth.;
I only wish for you to understand the path that I have chosen for myself.${prompt};
...${prompt};
...${prompt};
My journey with you has brought priceless experiences and valuable time to think.;
I have no words to express my gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt};
If you continue to battle the Emptiness, we may yet meet again.;
When we do, call me by my real name.${prompt};
Snap out of it, fuzz-for-brains.;
It's time to see our sister off.${prompt};
Yeah...;
After all, she's still our big sister.;
That will neverrr change.${prompt};
Exactly.;
We're not just hunters of sin.;
We're also guardians of those we love.${prompt};
Why, this brings back memorrries.;
The daughters of the Mithran Tracker I met twenty years ago have also chosen the life of the sin hunter.${prompt};
I pray that they, too, find the path of justice.${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Scry away.;
I predict I'll be needing my money.${prompt};
It appears my paltry fee outweighs your paltry purse...${prompt};
Very well.;
Let us see what the spirits reveal...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Ve～ry interesting...${prompt};
And as for your perfect partner...;
Seek one who bears the title of “${title: 2[2]}.”${prompt};
I'll be waiting when your need to know grows beyond tolerance.${prompt};
Here are a few words of wisdom to see you on your way.${prompt};
“The poor warrior blames his weapons.”${prompt};
“The hippogriff has fair feathers, but foul feet.”${prompt};
“To love a person, you must love their faults.”${prompt};
“Love and courage will find a way.”${prompt};
“Even the best party comes to an end.”${prompt};
“The balance distinguishes not between gold and lead.”${prompt};
“Ill gotten gil becomes gil ill gone.”${prompt};
“The proof of an apple pie is in the eating.”${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you not?;
My name is Wilhelm. I am a purchasing agent for the Brugaire Consortium.${prompt};
I have quite a bit of respect for you adventurers. I think it is marvelous that there are people in this world who are doing their best to help others.${prompt};
This is just a passing rumor, but I heard that several people have ventured to another world and encountered extraordinary beings...in a mysterious place, enveloped in light!${prompt};
It is quite a far-fetched tale, if I say so myself! It would seem that such an absurd story cannot be true, and asking if you have been to such a land would be utterly ludicrous...but still, I cannot hold back my curiosity, if indeed you have seen this ethereal land.${prompt};
Have you been to such a place?;
${selection-lines};
Been there, done that!;
Where again?${prompt};
I apologize for my forward behavior. If you ever do see such a place, you must return and tell me of the wonders that you find!${prompt};
By Altana! You are far more courageous than the average adventurer!;
Then tell me, have you seen the giant black beasts which do not seem to be living creatures, but machines with flesh and blood?${prompt};
Truth be told, I am currently on orders from a certain nation to seek out such a beast.${prompt};
I am not proposing anything so preposterous as attempting to capture the creature, however. I only require a fragment from one of the beasts. If you manage to get one, I would be most pleased if you brought it to me.${prompt};
But of course, I shall not simply take without giving something in return. Let this be known to no one, but we at the Brugaire Consortium recently came into the possession of extravagant armor and apparel from the Near East. I may be able to make some...special arrangements...if you lend your assistance.${prompt};
O illustrious adventurer, please accept my plea!${prompt};
I have heard that the black creatures reside in two places: at the top of an illuminated tower and at the bottom of a dark abyss. It also seems that there are two types: one that crawls on four legs and one that floats in the air. All I require is a segment from one of them. I implore you, please lend me your aid!${prompt};
Th-this is undeniably a fragment of the legendary Ultima! Kamaal! You must see this, Kamaal!${prompt};
You fool! I only need to be called once. I do have ears!${prompt};
Show it to me.${prompt};
Th-this is...artificial skin!? And an artificial frame, too... This is a segment taken from Ultima, without question.${prompt};
Adventurer, you have my gratitude.;
The restoration project in my homeland will be able to move into new research now, thanks to you.${prompt};
In the near future, our nation may need the help of distinguished adventurers such as yourself. I hope to see you again in my homeland, then.${prompt};
Rifaqat. Give this ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman his/lady her] reward. I think ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will be most pleased.${prompt};
The most skilled clothcrafters in Aht Urhgan weaved this over a span of ten years. It is a gift of utmost quality...and I humbly present it to you.${prompt};
If you acquire any more segments of Ultima, I would greatly appreciate it if you could bring them to me.${prompt};
Another segment from Ultima! You have my utmost gratitude. Please accept this in return.${prompt};
Th-this is undeniably a fragment of the legendary Omega! Hadiyah! You must see this, Hadiyah!${prompt};
Insolent fool! Who gave you the right to speak my name? Have you no idea who I am? I am a blue mage! You must show proper respect around me!${prompt};
Hurry up and show me what you have, you blithering milksop!${prompt};
This... It is all artificial! The flesh...the blood...marvelous! This is most certainly a segment of Omega!${prompt};
May your name be praised, adventurer!;
With this, restoration of the light divinity shall proceed in leaps and bounds!${prompt};
It appears that these “adventurers” are even more remarkable than I have heard. I would very much appreciate it if you would come to visit our great nation someday!${prompt};
Rifaqat, get off your tail and give this adventurer ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] reward, now! Let us hope ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] finds it most useful on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] adventures.${prompt};
The most skilled armorers in Aht Urhgan forged this over a span of ten years. It is a gift of utmost quality...and I humbly present it to you.${prompt};
If you acquire any more segments of Omega, I would greatly appreciate it if you could bring them to me.${prompt};
Another segment from Omega! You have my utmost gratitude. Please accept this in return.${prompt};
Yes...it's unmistakable.;
A fragment of Omega, and a far more ancient specimen than any we've encountered thus far!${prompt};
Now, Hadiyah will have no choice but to recognize my efforts!;
Wilhelm's day has come, and it shall be a glorious one! Muahahahahahaha!${prompt};
<Ahem>... Word has it that there are other curious materials to be found in this otherworldly place.;
Deliver to me some samples along with this fragment, and I shall reward you with rare pieces of equipment from the Consortium's vaults.${prompt};
Furthermore, should you already possess any pieces of equipment from a previous transaction, I would encourage you to deliver them to me along with this segment.${prompt};
The Consortium has in its employ a smith of the highest renown.;
He shall work his genius upon your treasured possession.${prompt};
I see you are a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your word.;
As am I, my friend. Take this, for you have earned it many times over.${prompt};
Why, this is...! A segment of Ultima, and one unlike any I have seen before!;
Wherever, pray tell, did you come upon this?${prompt};
Ah, but it matters not. What matters is that Kamaal--that blustering blowhard--will finally be forced to show me some respect!;
Heh! Hah! Heahaheahehahyah!${prompt};
<Ahem>... Word has it that there are other curious materials to be found in this otherworldly place.;
Deliver to me some samples along with this fragment, and I shall reward you with rare pieces of equipment from the Consortium's vaults.${prompt};

Take this, and may it serve you well.${prompt};
Mauriri is my name, and sending parcels from Mhaura is my game.♪${prompt};

Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.${prompt};
You do not possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. You were not permitted to board the ship...${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;

Huhn huhhhn. Of course a wimp like you would want to come bask in the radiance of a living-wiving legend like the Zurk.;

Ah, so you're the greenhorn Anastase was flip-flapping about.${prompt};
Don't get your pantaloons in a bunchy-wunch. The Zurk's already found the geomagnetic field you're looking for.;
How? Because he's perfection incarnate.${prompt};
So, you gonna attune that thing to this spotaru or what?${prompt};
Ohoho, the Zurk likes your style, adventurer. He can always sympathize with those who like to defy fate.;
The Zurk himself doesn't play by anyone's rulesy-wules...not even his own.${prompt};
The obvious choice, but the Zurk abides. Now put your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} on the ground here and wait for the action-waction to unfold.${prompt};
Since you've travel-waveled from Jeuno, you've already attuned your stuff to there, right?${prompt};
Don't worry about the Mhaura end of this waypoint, the Zurk's got you covered. Use it to your heart's contentaru.${prompt};
The floating contraption-waption of infinite wonder inside is where the real magic happens.${prompt};
Of course, no mere mortal could understand the complex configurations of this waypointaru. That's why the Zurk, also known throughout Adoulin as the Second Coming of the Occult, will condescend to--${prompt};
What!? Master Anastase wants a reportaru from the Zurk!?${prompt};
Everyone knows you're not supposed to interruptaru the hero during his speech! What a terrible sense of timing you have.${prompt};
Now that you've killed the moment...um...this waypoint isn't up to snuffy-wuff yet, so...${prompt};
Just tell him that the Zurk's employing every onz of his decisiveness, determination, and most importantly, his daring-waring to save the day!${prompt};
Also be sure to mention that the slightest-wightest disruption in the Zurk's concentration can resultaru in Vana'diel's complete decimation...so he won't be making any reports for a while.${prompt};
The fate of the world hangs in the balance, understand!? You're to report that the Zurk is on a mission of the most epic-wepic proportions for the good of all mankind.;
There is no other option.${prompt};
Hnnng!;
The Zurk can feel it! The rune from which his unfathomable powers derive is about to eruptaru!;
Must...suppress...its eldritch-weldritch energy! The prophesied time...is yet to come!${prompt};
Wh-whatever can this be...!?;
From an obsidian-widian darkness flows a malicious outpouring of flavor that assaultarus the tongue with an overpowering sweetness!${prompt};
Hmph, your naivety amuses me.;
No matter how much you whine, the Zurk cannot return what has willingly given-wiven itself up to his soul!${prompt};
Those eyes brimming with tears of desire! Only a complete coward would actually exploit an adversary's weakness!;
Here, take this confection and departaru from the Zurk's presence! You disgust him!${prompt};
These dazzling runey-wunes attract so many adoring fans that the Zurk can barely keep count! Have you come for an autograph?${prompt};
Some food from Adoulin? Let the Zurk get a tastey-waste of that...${prompt};
<Mmmf> Anastase'sth granddaughter made sucth a <smack> delectable treataru? Thith is so divine that the Zurk might <burp> grathe her with the boon of hith thmile when he gets back <gulp>.${prompt};

The Zurk's minions have informed him that you're to brave the gauntletaru and tread a path toward enlightenment by undergoing the Trial of Reason.${prompt};
Pride goes before the fally-wall, they say, so let not hubris's grip tighten upon your soul. Otherwise, it shall drag you slowly netherward, into the depths of anonymity.${prompt};
Shame and depression cling tightly to those who listen not to the Zurk's words of wisdom, hauntaruing them like nightmares in tandem. Someone as slovenly as you has no chance to best that maiden in battle-wattle and part the gates of knowledge.${prompt};
It was a mere coincidence that a feeble mortaru like you could defeat the Zurk. Were it not for the needles of some demon overlord constantly assaulting his head and sides, he could have dispatched you with but his pinky finger.${prompt};
The Zurk wouldn't gloataru if he were you. That girl will hand you your head on a platter-watter, just you wait and see.${prompt};
Not like an imbecile with a gaping-waping hole for a head like you knows when to throw down ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] sword, though...${prompt};
You've held the blessed lightaru of acceptance in your palms after defeating our arbiter. Now begins your fated-wated rendezvous with the occultist characters under the tree of wisdom.${prompt};
No need to thank the Zurk. He needs only the consolation that you'd be imprisoned in a chamber of ice were it not for his heroic actions in distractaruing that beast.${prompt};
What? You dare accuse the Zurk of attemptaruing petty-wetty thievery?;
Damn the myriad hells that boil below!${prompt};
The...the...the ultimataru trial!?${prompt};
No good can come of your participation-wation in this!${prompt};
The Zurk had seen omens that portended your arrival-wival at this peak of runic glory...${prompt};
That's why he tried so ardently to stop your ascent! Not to satiataru his inner darkness for once, but because...${prompt};
Because he grows weary of seeing those he's grown attached to get hurtaru...${prompt};
${name-player}! You live!${prompt};
The Zurk...bows to your superior-werior talents.${prompt};
<Sniffle> <sniffle>...${prompt};
Th-thank you.${prompt};
Don't get the wrong idea. I only meant on behalf of Adoulin-wadoulin. The Zurk cannot be kept prisoner by any emotion!${prompt};

Do not mishear, for the Zurk has not been deterred in the slightaruest! He shall forge-worge ahead down his own, as you shall do the same with yours.${prompt};
May the runes be with you.${prompt};
The Zurk goes easy-weasy on no one! Not even the tiniest of tots!${prompt};
So the Zurk's main rival-wival is back for a lesson in rune engraving?${prompt};

And yes, I am well aware that adventurers often charge a fee for their services, and I will personally see to it that you are properly recompensed.${prompt};
Come back soon!${prompt};
How fabulous that you made it back safe, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Your return couldn't have been more timely--Gilgamesh's ship has only just docked.${prompt};
${name-player}, good t' see yer face again!${prompt};
So you're ${name-player}, eh? I've 'eard much 'bout ya.${prompt};
Let's get the small matter of the ${item-plural: 1[2]} out of the way first. Here you go.${prompt};
Aye, this be just what we ordered. Now a little tit-fer-tat...${prompt};
Always too kind, Gilgamesh. Here, ${name-player}--one for you, too.${prompt};
Suppose we'd best get down t' business.${prompt};
${name-player}, yer intimately familiar with my journeys as a pirate on the Bastore Sea.${prompt};
${name-player}, might come as a bit of a surprise to hear this, but I'm a pirate known for roamin' the Bastore Sea.${prompt};
The oceans ta the west have been a bit stormier'n usual of late, an' me crew an' I came across a small vessel adrift upon the tides.${prompt};
So 'course I say to meself, who'd'a thunk that such a delicate rowboat could stay whole in such a terrible brew...an' then the whole thin' started flashin' red.${prompt};
Being the curious sailor I am, I went an' investigated. Lo and behold, there was a pretty young lass lyin' prone along the deck.${prompt};
I've always had quite the fondness fer the color red. Figurin' it must be a sign from Altana herself, I took her on board and brought her back with me ta Norg.${prompt};
When she came to, the first words from those pale lips of hers were yer name.${prompt};
So I want ya ta come back ta Norg with us. She was quite insistent on meetin' ya.${prompt};
Ya see, she's gone on a bit of a...hunger strike.${prompt};
The ship's docked at port waitin' ta take you whenever ya've got yer affairs in order here.${prompt};
I just remembered a bit of a pressin' engagement I've gotta attend to, but I'll catch up with ya there.${prompt};
A-ahem. One last thing before you go. Please, please breathe no word to the citizens about me abetting a known pirate.${prompt};
They might not all understand that a port town is only looking out for its best interests when it ensures that those less on the...up-and-up remain happy. When push comes to shove, aren't we all just looking out for each other?${prompt};
And while I'm not biting the hand that feeds me, I'd like to inform you that the token I have just offered is highly valued here in Mhaura.${prompt};
Why don't you have a brief chat with Vera here before you leave for Norg?${prompt};

A fantastic day to you, good ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]! I, Gorpa-Masorpa, have been dispatch-watched from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network to...to...${prompt};
...to serve adventurers...${prompt};
...under the auspices of...${prompt};
...the great, almightaruly...${prompt};
Abdhaljs!${wait-36: 2};
<Cough, cough>${prompt};
Urk...${prompt};
Tohoho...hohohohohohohoho!${prompt};
You, uh, see...${prompt};
Abdhaljs, creator of the tiny, tiny place known as Legion, has seen fitaru to permit us the use of his creation!${prompt};
Oh, does the luck-wuck of the A.M.A.N. know no bounds!?${prompt};
This slightly repurposed Maquette Abdhaljs - Legion has undergone a variety of improvementarus by some of our association's most skilled thaumaturges.${prompt};
Steel yourselves for our latestaru creation--Ambuscade!${prompt};
In Ambuscade, you'll square off againstaru a bevy of foes just chomping at the bit to see you torn into itty-bitty pieces!${prompt};
Every month (Earth time), new challengers enter the arena, providing different challenges from the month before.${prompt};
Now, now, wipe that dribble off your chin, for there are a couple hoops-woops we're going to make you jump through before you can join.${prompt};
First, you must be in a party of up to six players.${prompt};
Second, you must be in possession of either ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} or ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Either of the two will suffice.${prompt};
These two goodies can be procured by completaruing specific Records of Eminence objectives.${prompt};
You mightaru think those tasks to be laughably simple, but trust me--it keeps out the riffraff. When you're prepared, examine the Ambuscade tome and be on your way.${prompt};
And now, I would like to discuss the rewards.${prompt};
Simply put, all you need to know is that victory in Ambuscade will reward you with a special currency known as hallmarks.${prompt};
There are two varieties of reward available: those that are purchasable in exchange for a certain number of hallmarks, and those you receive once you have reached a particular-wicular running total of hallmarks.${prompt};
If you're inclined to join forces with other player-wayers, you'll receive an even more special currency known as “gallantry.”${prompt};
It goes withoutaru saying that there are special rewards available in exchange for badges of gallantry, too.${prompt};
I can see your lips quivering at the thought of receiving such extraordinary spoils!${prompt};
Be advised-wised in advance that you will lose all your hallmarks and badges of gallantry once the Ambuscade has switched to new content.${prompt};
(...And I'm not supposed to tell you this, but the rewards change as the Ambuscade does.)${prompt};
That's the long and short--mostly long--of it. Now get those items and try your luck!${prompt};
Wh-what's this? You're unfamiliar with Records of Eminence? Then firstaru speak with one of our representatives in charge of Eminence to get started.${prompt};
...To ask you to set the Ambuscade Records of Eminence objective from the “Tutorial” category!${prompt};
Welcome, welcome! Back for more?${prompt};

“${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 5[2]} are unable to provide further enhancements, but the other benefits they can provide are rather unique.${prompt};
“But I beg of you--please do not attempt to alter the equipment yourself. I'd rather not have to pay the residents of this fine city to clean your remnants from the ground. Instead, entrust my compatriots at the A.M.A.N. to do that for you.${prompt};
“Whatever path you select for your equipment, I am certain it will serve you well. Goddess-speed, and may your battles end in victory!”${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
It's been a few weeks since I arrived here in Mhaura, and I couldn't be more frustrated.${prompt};

Ahh, it's nice to see you, good ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]. I have received a new letter.${prompt};
Um, you see...${prompt};
This letter comes from the greataru mage Abdhaljs himself.${prompt};
Here, you may feel free to give it a read-wead.${prompt};
I look forward to helping you with all of your equipment needs!${prompt};
“Dearest adventurer,;
I am pleased to hear that you have performed well in the Ambuscade.${prompt};
“As a token of my appreciation, I have prepared a new reward for your efforts. It is a material that I refer to as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
“Although the technology behind it must remain secret, it is able to upgrade equipment such as your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. However, you will need many of them to perform the upgrade.${prompt};
“I have left the details with my representative at the A.M.A.N. Please check with him for more information.${prompt};
“Simply give the ${item-plural: 0[2]} and the item you wish to upgrade to my compatriot at the A.M.A.N. and he will bring out the very best in your equipment. I hope you will give it a try when you get a chance.”${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How have you been? I am doing well.${prompt};
“I'm finally getting used to my life here in Mhaura. Rycharde is an excellentaru chef. In fact, Mhauran couscous is now one of my favorite dishes.${prompt};
“I'm still having trouble at work though. The adventurers trying their hand at the Ambuscade are coming back with all kinds of cuts and scrapes-wapes, and sometimes in even worse shape. My days are definitely full of adventure.${prompt};
“P.S.;
Lately, I've been hooked-wooked on doing Cardian impressions. Personally, I think I've gotten pretty good at them.”${prompt};
Everyday's a grand surprise when you take part in an Ambuscade!${prompt};
“Dearest Adventurer,;
Thanks to your most steadfast efforts, I have accumulated a veritable treasure trove of data that will surely prove useful in my studies.${prompt};
“But lest you think my words hollow, I have prepared an even greater set of rewards in the form of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
“These amazing materials can be used to augment equipment such as ${item-plural: 0[2]}. It should come as no surprise that you will need multiples of this fine new bounty in order to augment your attire.${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How have you been? I am doing well.${prompt};
“I've heard some scary tales of pirates boarding innocent vessels that leave here from Mhaura. And you know what's even scarier? That this pleases the adventurers to no end!${prompt};
“Of course, this has profoundly affected what remains of my sanity, so I asked A.M.A.N. for a mental health leave. However, they denied my request, saying that hard work is the best medicine.${prompt};
“P.S.;
Please send cookies. They may be the only thing that gets me through the dark days ahead.”${prompt};

“Dearest Adventurer,;
Due to your most remarkable exploits in the Ambuscade, I have once again gleaned insights that will prove most valuable in my studies.${prompt};
“As is my wont, I have prepared for you a most lavish reward in the form of weapons which I call ${item-plural: 0[2]}, and other arms in the same vein.${prompt};
“I have also readied for your benefit an arcane metal of my own devising, ${item-plural: 1[2]}. While I cannot divulge the secrets behind this material, let it suffice to say that it will serve you in upgrading the aforementioned weapons, provided you are able to procure the requisite quantity.${prompt};
“I would also be remiss not to inform you that these weapons are still under development. That is to say, I will require yet more battle data before I can refine them to reach their true potential. As such, I would most humbly entreat your continued cooperation.${prompt};
“Simply deliver the requisite quantity of ${item-plural: 0[2]} and your weapon of choice to my compatriot at the A.M.A.N., and he will perform the necessary procedure to help unlock the item's latent powers. Do be sure to try it out, and evaluate for yourself its true potential.”${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How do you fare? I am doing quite well, thank you.${prompt};
“The ships that set forth from Mhaura journey-wourney to a faraway empire known as Aht Urhgan. I had a thoughtaru I would like to visit it myself someday, so I began researching it in detail.${prompt};

“Dearest adventurers,;
“Permit me to dispense with the pleasantries and get right down to business.${prompt};
“The ${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items I mentioned in a previous communique are finally able to be reforged. I have invented a new type of material, dubbed “${item-plural: 1[2]},” specifically for this purpose.${prompt};
“I am loath to admit that the exact workings of this new material are a trade secret, but I hope you will indulge me and content yourself in knowing that they serve as excellent catalysts for improving ${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items. I say “catalysts” in the plural because more than one is needed.${prompt};
“I bid you not to fret--this is not the final shape that these weapons will take, but I need more detailed data before I am able to complete my research.${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How have you been? I have been doing quite well.${prompt};
“If you have a spare moment, could you please send me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}? I have taken quite the liking to fishing, and am hankering to make some ${item-plural: 2[2]} with all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} I've caught.${prompt};
“I think I've come quite far as a cook. Perhaps that lovely Rycharde fellow will teach me a thing or two if I butter him up.${prompt};

“Dearest adventurer,;
Once again, allow me to get straight to the point.${prompt};
“The ${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items I mentioned in a previous communique are finally able to be reforged. I have invented a new type of material, dubbed “${item-plural: 1[2]},” specifically for this purpose.${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How have you been? I have been doing quite well.${prompt};
“Have you ever heard of ${color: 5}soy ramen${color: 1}? An adventurer in the Ambuscade was eating it. I asked Rycharde and apparently it's a dish from the Far East.${prompt};
“I've become a pretty good cook-wook, so it's got my interest piqued. I'll make it for you if I can get all of the ingredients together.${prompt};
“P.S.;
While it's fun answering quiz questions-wuestions, I also like thinking up new ones!”${prompt};
Ambuscade quiz time!${prompt};
Get ready for the final round!${prompt};
What is the name of the tiny location where Abdhaljs holds the Ambuscade?${prompt};
How many hallmarks have you obtained in total so far?${prompt};
Who have I impersonated before?${prompt};
“At last, your weapons such as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} are near completion. I have prepared a material known as ${item-plural: 1[2]} that you will need. However, this material alone will not be enough for our requirements.${prompt};
“In order to complete the process, we'll also need a weapon such as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that is known as a Pulse Panoplia.${prompt};
“The specific weapon type is of no consequence, but one Pulse Panoplia is required in order to complete one weapon. Therefore, I need you to get a Pulse Panoplia for us.${prompt};
“The exact technique is a trade secret, but when the Pulse Panoplia you provide combines with my ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to complete the upgrade process for weapons such as the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
“As you can probably imagine, you will need a fair number of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
“If you hand the materials and the weapon you wish to upgrade over to my good friend at the A.M.A.N., he will be sure to bring out the very best in it. Go give it a try and see for yourself.”${prompt};
“Mommy Dearest,;
How have you been? I have been doing quite well.${prompt};
“I looked-wooked into soy ramen some more, and apparently, it is a noodle dish flavored with soy sauce. There are also many other variations, such as miso or salt.${prompt};
“I've seen miso-wiso at the Culinarians' Guild in Windurst before. Do you think you could send me some?${prompt};
“P.S.;
Once I'm able to make ramen myself, I will send you a little projectaru I've been working on. It's a book containing all of the dishes I have made so far.”${prompt};
Ah yes, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}... You will need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and one Pulse Panoplia item such as ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, as well as ${number: 4} ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};

Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt};
Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt};
At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt};
"There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is ""Random.""${prompt}";
This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt};
The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt};
You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt};
The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt};
Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt};
From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt};
For example, if you select Area 1,${wait-36: 4}one mandragora will move to Area 2${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 3,${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 4.${prompt};
Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt};
You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt};
You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt};
If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt};
The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt};
This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt};
However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt};
Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt};
Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt};
Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).${prompt};
Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).${prompt};
The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.${prompt};
The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.${prompt};
The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.${prompt};
