No matter how many tomes we pore over, we cannot find a reliable remedy. This is unacceptable.${prompt};
Perhaps we underestimated the severity of the situation.${prompt};
But, Margret, look--if we just had ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} like it said in that tattered volume...${prompt};
<Huff> You know as well as I that the process outlined there is overly simplified! We cannot merely waltz into Foret de Hennetiel, pluck some herbs, and be done with it.${prompt};

Grinding a fistful of its roasted leaves and administering the resultant powder as a tonic will cure his ailment...or so this text says.${prompt};
Should you happen to stumble across so much as a seedling in the forest, would you do me the kindness of bringing it to my manor? The author described the leaves as being of a deep green hue, with grooved ridges that let rainwater slide right off.${prompt};
Should you succeed, you know where to find me.${prompt};
Mistress Svenja's heart is truly made of gold, dropping everything in her hectic schedule to search for a cure like this.${prompt};

My standing may be nothing compared to that of the mistress, but I ask that you do her this favor.${prompt};
Welcome to the Celennia Memorial Library, an archive of everything related to Adoulin.${prompt};
Only those with the proper credentials are able to view the information and data collected by the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition is always adding to their stores of knowledge, so check back periodically to see if there's something new on which to feast your mind.${prompt};
Congratulations, Robertioux. To be named high exorcist is quite an honor.${prompt};
What a farce. An empty title at best now that I no longer possess the eye's power.${prompt};
Though I have been chosen to join the high exorcists, I will be of little use to the order now.${prompt};
It's a fresh start--a chance to discover your true strength.${prompt};
Tell me, Erfimia. What do you stand to gain from keeping the order in the dark?${prompt};
Surely revealing the truth would win you friends in high places. Do you not resent the fact that I am to be rewarded for abusing a profane power?${prompt};
I don't resent you, Robertioux, although I can't condone your actions.${prompt};
What you've been doing is wrong, even now.${prompt};
Then why have you not spoken out?${prompt};
Believe me, I could have, but...${prompt};
In the end, I knew that revealing your secret wouldn't make things right, I guess.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh! ${name-player}, you're here!${prompt};
Good. I have a favor to ask of you.${prompt};
Over here.${prompt};
Ever since that time in Yorcia Weald, I've been trying to learn more about the Ahriman that gave Robertioux the eye.${prompt};
Don't you think it's strange? Ahriman aren't native to Ulbuka. How did it even get here? I've spent countless nights here, searching for answers.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition wasn't any help and it looks like my research hasn't turned up any leads, either. That leaves only one thing to do.${prompt};
I've got to get out there and look for clues myself.${prompt};
I say “I,” but...well, I was really hoping you could come with me again.${prompt};
Ah, Erfimia. I see you have developed quite an appetite for knowledge these past few days.${prompt};
Exorcist Frondeaubaire. Are you researching something as well?${prompt};
Indeed.${prompt};
When I was searching for you and Robertioux in the weald, I caught sight of something strange...an Ahriman.${prompt};
I felt that such an unusual occurrence in Ulbuka necessitated further inquiry.${prompt};
An Ahriman? In Yorcia Weald? Where exactly did you see it? Please!${prompt};
Hm? Well, I recorded the sighting around I-8 on my map, but wh--${prompt};
Come on, ${name-player}! Let's hope it's still out there!${prompt};
Er...Erfimia?;
Lady Erfimia told me to inform you that she has gone ahead to I-8 in ${unknown: 0x01053782878280} and will meet you there. She was in such an awful hurry. Whatever could be the matter?${prompt};

The Twelve Orders are organizations that control the Sacred City of Adoulin's political and economic climates. Only the most eminent of members may be chosen as successors to an order when a leader either abdicates or passes on.${prompt};
Though not considered houses by strict standards--as they are not always headed by the progeny of an order's founding member, and sometimes even choose not to appoint a leader if none of the candidates are deemed fit for succession--their lineages remain intact thanks in part to adoption of heirs and strategic marriage practices.${prompt};
Each order has its own sphere of influence, and the representative of a particular order will assume the office of either minister or maester of its appointed dominion, working for the benefit of the city and its populace.${prompt};
${choice: 0}[While no longer officially a royal family, the/The] Adoulins are direct descendants of the founder king--August Adoulin--with the blood of that renowned rule coursing uncorrupted through the veins of its current scion, ${choice: 0}[Ygnas S. Adoulin/Arciela V. Adoulin].${prompt};
The Order of Adoulin:;
Formerly the royal family, the members of this order sit at the apex of the alliance which gave birth to the Sacred City of Adoulin, and their representative traditionally claims the position of grand chancellor within Adoulin's body politic. The order is symbolized by a swallow, the germaneness of which has engendered much debate.${prompt};
With the venerable King August Adoulin as the order's ancestor, it is only natural that the community looks to them when in need of direction and decisive action. The family occupies Castle Adoulin, the towering edifice that defines the eastern district of the city.${prompt};
The Order of Woltaris:;
Symbolized by a verdant leaf in ages past, this order's distinguished members hold the economic fate of the city in their hands, as its most distinguished of members take office as the minister of finance. Therefore, as the head of the order, Melvien de Malecroix serves in this esteemed post.${prompt};
The Order of Woltaris:;
Symbolized by a verdant leaf in ages past, this order's distinguished members hold the economic fate of the city in their hands, as its most distinguished of members take office as the minister of finance. As the former head of the order, Melvien de Malecroix once served in this esteemed post.${prompt};
Due to the sway they hold over this station, the vast majority of this organization devotes itself to the study of fiscal matters and theories of coin inside its building situated in Eastern Adoulin's Coronal Esplanade. Their custom of instilling pecuniary perspicacity in its members perhaps explains why more bureaucrats hail from the Order of Woltaris than any other institution in Ulbuka.${prompt};
The Order of Weatherspoon:;
Purveyors of Adoulin's judicial system, the order is led by the senescent and austere Hildebert. In contrast, their coat of arms once consisted of a young and vibrant butterfly, which has often been used as a joke at the aging Elvaan's expense.${prompt};
The Order of Weatherspoon also exercises jurisdiction over exorcist activities, and the position of archexorcist--occupied by Vortimere as of this writing--is always chosen by those within the order. The group shares the Coronal Esplanade with the Order of Woltaris as the site of its headquarters.${prompt};
The Order of Janniston:;
The motherly Svenja uses her seemingly infinite kindness to fairly govern this organization. With her unconditional largesse and inexhaustible energy, it's difficult to tell exactly where Svenja's role as maester ends and the rest of the Order begins.${prompt};
The order's coat of arms was adorned with a soothingly cool dewdrop long ago, which even now perfectly exemplifies the fact that many of its members are adept practitioners of medicine and white magic. They often give back to the community by supporting pioneers on the front lines of the colonization movement and looking after ailing individuals within the city's walls, with their base of operations situated in Western Adoulin's Platea Triumphus.${prompt};
The Order of Renaye:;
The old symbol of this order--a lush tuft of shimmering grass--accurately illustrates the importance they place on the natural world, which is also heralded by their mistress and Adoulin's minister of education, Ikhi Askamot.${prompt};
In addition to cultivating geomantic powers, the order also works to instill skepticism and critical thinking in its members, which explains why researchers--in addition to geomancers--belong to this order. Interestingly, the order's abode rests snugly on the side of Sverdhried Hillock--named after the father of the runic arts.${prompt};
The Order of Gorney:;
Many Adoulinians joke that while the snake is slimy enough, the order's insignia should be the mosquito instead because its doyen, Chero-Machero, the minister of commerce, is wildly successful at sucking the city's populace dry.${prompt};
While their tendency to spurn the more theoretical aspects of economics for the sake of turning a profit does not necessarily help their cause, no one can argue that merchants from the Order of Gorney--both at home and abroad--do not contribute to the wealth of the city as a whole. Those interested in making a little extra bayld or learning the gift of the gab to get gil should seek them out in the Coronal Esplanade in Eastern Adoulin.${prompt};
The Order of Haverton:;
Sometimes known by the midnight raven that acted as their regalia in the days of yore, this order is headed by the heady and inquisitive Margret. They are intricately tied to the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt};
To further this symbiotic relationship, the order puts its members through myriad living hells to ensure they possess the wit and determination to accurately gather all the necessary information needed for their assignment and to concisely convey it to their clients. Like many of the other orders tied to specific coalitions, the building in which the Order of Haverton conducts most of its business sits directly across from its sister coalition...though some speculate that this architectural arrangement is so that coalition members can catch order escapees mid-flight.${prompt};
The Order of Karieyh:;
This order may possibly be the most recognizable, not only because its leader serves as the maester for the Pioneers' Coalition--which anyone who has braved the infinitely long lines to register as a pioneer knows is a popular one--but because she is also the famous Lhe Lhangavo. Many a Pioneers' Coalition member has undertaken a mission at her behest to come back utterly exhausted, but better for both the experience and the opportunity to work for “the good of Adoulin.” Their symbol, a monkey, represents ingenuity in the face of the unknown.${prompt};
However, Lhe's tough love is but a continuation of the order's policies, which have brought prosperity to Adoulin as well as notoriety to the coalition. Through extensive survival training that consists of spending weeks on end deep within the Eastern Ulbukan jungle, agricultural endeavors that leave participants with dirt up to their elbows, and the operation of island workshops throughout the archipelago, the Order of Karieyh brings a bounty from both land and sea back to Adoulin. Its main building stands right next to that of the Pioneers' Coalition in Western Adoulin, which makes it difficult to miss.${prompt};
The Order of Vocane:;
Tasked with keeping the city safe and sound, those within its ranks who exhibit an exceptional sense of allegiance to Adoulin and an ability to keep their composure can be elevated to the role of Peacekeepers' Coalition maester. The grizzly Gratzigg currently occupies that position, and Adoulin's denizens report that peace has certainly taken root throughout the city, much like the order's ancient emblem.${prompt};
As keeping the peace involves dealing with nefarious criminals and sanguinary monstrosities, they place particular emphasis upon having a muscular frame. Training for new recruits is especially arduous, with sessions beginning in the wee hours of the morning in front of the order's headquarters next to the Peacekeepers' Coalition and ending when Eastern Adoulin is once again enveloped in darkness.${prompt};
The Order of Thurandaut:;
Currently headed by the dry-witted Flaviria, those within the order's ranks who wish to be appointed as the Mummers' Coalition maester must dance circles around their competition. For an appropriate analogy to this, one need look no further than the darting tongue of the order's ancient emblem--the lizard.${prompt};
Though many members take the analogy farther by becoming proficient with the lizard-tongue-like polearm, the order is well known for their performers skilled in both letters and arms. The more avant-garde entertainers among them have begun adding techniques involving small animals to their repertoire, which causes detractors to quip that their building near the Residential Area is the most entertaining and cost-effective bestiary in all of Ulbuka.${prompt};
The Order of Shneddick:;
In contrast with its antiquarian murine emblem, the Order of Shneddick-raised maesters of the Couriers' Coalition have been nothing but the pinnacle of righteousness, of which the current maester, Reginald, is an excellent example.${prompt};
Though members may tame beasts in a similar manner to their counterparts from the Order of Thurandaut, they combine their skills in domestication with knowledge in the field of transport to improve trade routes with the other nations. They also guard against smuggling, and barely have a blemish on their record. The monument to efficiency that is their building stands behind the Couriers' Coalition, a symbol of Reginald's belief that the members of the order keep the city operating behind the scenes.${prompt};
The Order of Orvail:;
Formerly an order of knights who flew banners emblazoned with spiders, this order now maintains close ties with the Inventors' Coalition. The head of Orvail--Amchuchu, an energetic and gifted rune fencer--serves concurrently as the leader of both organizations.${prompt};
Many order members dabble in crafting as well as the runic arts, which explains why so many of them go on to become rune fencers and contribute to the Inventors' Coalition. In addition, the order places a particular emphasis on the thrill of discovery, leading to an exceptional number of naval recruits and explorers from among their ranks. The building that houses this band of inquisitive individuals can be found directly behind the Inventors' Coalition's headquarters.${prompt};
Grand Chancellor:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Adoulin, this office is currently held by Ygnas S. Adoulin.${prompt};
Those who assume the role of chancellor must possess a great sense of responsibility, for they become the figurehead for the entirety of the Sacred City of Adoulin. With the advancement of the colonization movement, the chancellor has also had to try his hand at foreign affairs in recent years.${prompt};
Minister of Finance:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Woltaris, this office is currently held by Melvien de Malecroix.${prompt};
Minister of Finance:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Woltaris, this office was previously held by Melvien de Malecroix.${prompt};
Estienne has been acting in Melvien's stead following his untimely demise in the wilds.${prompt};
While those in this position are, strictly speaking, in charge of Adoulin's treasury and cataloguing the nation's expenditures, the minister of finance also acts as an unofficial consultant for various business matters. The coalitions often seek his advice on how to balance their ledgers, effectively maintain organizational hierarchy, and create profitable exhibitions of their services.${prompt};
Minister of Judication:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Weatherspoon, this office is currently held by Hildebert.${prompt};
The very image of impartiality, the minister of judication presides over Adoulin's courts and ensures the law is being observed to its fullest extent. Much like the minister of finance, he occasionally acts as a counselor to those in need of legal advice.${prompt};
Though the office of archexorcist also exists, the priory falls under the jurisdiction of the minister of judication. Therefore, his piety remains under constant scrutiny, and he is often encouraged to participate in religious ceremonies.${prompt};
Minister of Public Affairs:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Janniston, this office is currently held by Svenja.${prompt};
Well versed in the art of healing, this minister is also charged with keeping the streets pristine and the citizens happy. Arguably the minister with the closest ties to Adoulin's populace, her relationship to the people also forces her to be, for better or worse, a total populist. As she must spend much of her time interacting with denizens and compiling figures on their well-being, one can easily understand why this minister needs possess a charismatic personality.${prompt};
Minister of Education:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Renaye, this office is currently held by Ikhi Askamot.${prompt};
The minister of education endeavors to foster intellectual development among Adoulin's citizenry as well as provide them the necessary means to increase their quality of life. An avid interest in the city's history is another essential quality in education ministers, for research regarding one's past is the only way to avoid repeating those mistakes in the future. Finally, she also holds her own lectures in a special edifice built for the express purpose of educating the next generation of Adoulinians.${prompt};
Minister of Commerce:;
Traditionally occupied by a representative from the Order of Gorney, this office is currently held by Chero-Machero.${prompt};
Stimulating economic growth and facilitating mercantile success are two tasks the minister of commerce must undertake. Recent ministers have proposed some profoundly innovative business concepts, including the construction of island workshops off the coast of Ulbuka. The incumbent commercial supervisor continues this tradition of eccentric contrivances, stunning his peers in the assembly almost daily.${prompt};
Scouts' Coalition:;
They mainly concern themselves with the acquisition and analysis of intelligence, and the veritable ocean of information they have amassed ebbs and flows amongst the shelves of the Celennia Memorial Library.${prompt};
Expert cartographers abound in this coalition, led by Margret from the Order of Haverton, and the sale of maps detailing Ulbuka's cryptic locales are one of the most direct ways in which they support the colonization movement.${prompt};
Pioneers' Coalition:;
Perhaps one of the busiest coalitions on the continent, the Pioneers' Coalition supervises the registration and induction of pioneers from the Middle Lands. While certain members may have their hands full with those duties, the Order of Karieyh's Lhe Lhangavo did not ascend to her position as maester by breeding idle hands.${prompt};
The coalition also prepares invaluable materials to assist pioneers in establishing frontier stations and improving the coalition headquarters, for care taken on the outside reflects the effort put into matters on the inside. Lastly, they furnish adventurers with the latest contraptions to make the harsh wilderness that much more docile.${prompt};
Peacekeepers' Coalition:;
What began as a small legion of bodyguards to the king has grown into a full-fledged organization that serves and protects the whole populace of Adoulin. Once firmly rooted to a single calling, the coalition has expanded its horizons to include patrolling the streets and manning the parapets surrounding the city in order to defend it from the swarms of savage creatures hellsbent on razing it to the ground.${prompt};
Spearheaded by Gratzigg from the Order of Vocane, the members of this intensely loyal coalition pledge their lives to securing Adoulin's safety and giving its people the peace of mind to drift softly off to sleep each and every night. They train as if the world were to end on the morrow, and their bodies are said to rival midrium in both durability and strength.${prompt};
Mummers' Coalition:;
This troupe of seasoned performers act as messengers of merriment, refining their craft day after day in the pursuit of procuring the ultimate laugh from their audience. While their institution was originally thought to be of little import, their leader, Flaviria--from the Order of Thurandaut--proved that a single smile can set the soul at ease and turn the tide of battle when faced with an unforgiving frontier.${prompt};
A shining example of just how the word can be mightier than the sword is evinced by a certain Tarutaru comedic duo who have quietly been building a reputation for hilarious hijinks the continent over.${prompt};
Not only do they arrange events within Adoulin itself, but also venture outside the city's comforting walls to console lonely administrators and pioneers stranded in the wilds of East Ulbuka.${prompt};
Couriers' Coalition:;
Headed by the tight-lipped and straight-laced Reginald from the Order of Shneddick, the coalition has flourished under his meticulous supervision. In charge of coordinating shipments between nations, the physical transportation of goods, and stocking delivered products, there is never any rest for weary Couriers' Coalition members.${prompt};
In times of war and during the contemporary pioneering movement, however, their duties are expanded to include conveying provisions and arms to the brave souls fighting for Adoulin on the front lines. Though they may not receive many accolades for a job well done, it is undeniable that without them Adoulin would no longer be standing.${prompt};
Inventors' Coalition:;
From the armor worn proudly by the Peacekeepers' Coalition to the harpoons local fishermen use to bring home the catch of the day, the Inventors' Coalition creates or repairs most everything that Adoulinians and pioneers alike employ in their everyday lives.${prompt};
Their most prided concoctions, however, are the resplendent whirling waypoints that punctuate the landscape around Ulbuka. Guided by Amchuchu's diminutive but heavy hand, those in the coalition set about placing new waypoints and mending weathered ones when they have no requests to fill from townsfolk or Middle Landers.${prompt};
Ygnas S. Adoulin:;
As he leads the Order of Adoulin, he is entrusted with maintaining order throughout the lands within the Sacred City of Adoulin's alliance. Furthermore, he concurrently holds the office of grand chancellor at the assembly of the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
A remarkably young chancellor, he ascended to the position at the age of twenty after his father--and former chancellor--went missing. Whether Ygnas's controversial decision to reestablish the East Ulbukan colonization movement was a product of youthful indiscretion or a precocious stratagem has yet to be determined, but despite the outcome, the fact that it will drastically change Adoulin's fate cannot be argued.${prompt};
Since relinquishing his title as the order's head to his younger sister, Arciela, Ygnas has chosen to take a back seat to the everyday workings of the nation, yet his dedication to ensuring that the sacred city has a brighter future remains unwavering.${prompt};
Melvien de Malecroix:;
It is easy to see how Melvien has risen to the top of the Order of Woltaris and obtained a seat in the assembly as the minister of finance, since he is as calm as the undisturbed waters of the Zoldeff and has charisma that sparkles like newly excavated bayld.${prompt};
A close confidant to the grand chancellor and a valued ally, Melvien staunchly supports Ygnas S. Adoulin's decision to reopen the continent for colonization, and is possibly the most vehement proponent of the plan. Why strong opposition causes even this rock of an individual to momentarily lose his composure on occasion is unknown, but is a fascinating subject indeed.${prompt};
An accident during a brief research expedition into Kamihr Drifts led to his untimely demise at the young age of twenty-six.${prompt};
Hildebert:;
This elderly curmudgeon holds the office of minister of judication and belongs to the Order of Weatherspoon. A conservative traditionalist in the strictest sense, what he lacks in amicability he makes up for in candor and dedication, which may or may not be ideal qualities for one in charge of upholding the nation's code of law.${prompt};
Hildebert often embarks on unofficial surveys of Eastern Ulbuka to study it through the eyes of the justice system. Though some balk at his odd behavior, he notes that observing a habitat with an absence of law is equally as important as studying a society replete with legal ballasts. He is also a strict constructionist regarding the founder king's last words, and is consequently one of the most vocal opponents of the colonization movement.${prompt};
Svenja:;
Excessively kind and considered one of the most caring public officials in Adoulin, she uses her position as head of the Order of Janniston and minister of public affairs to further deepen her bonds with the community. As she is second in age only to Hildebert, it is no wonder why many view her as a maternal figure.${prompt};
Even the grand chancellor holds her in high regard, to the point where he accepts any scolding from her with merely a downturned head and expression of shame. Svenja's solid standing within the order has begun to fracture somewhat of late, however, with the reinstatement of the pioneering effort.${prompt};
Ikhi Askamot:;
A prominent geomancer with an interest in nature as deep as the Senroh Sea, this Mithra simultaneously stands at the forefront of the Order of Renaye and works as the minister of education.${prompt};
While she takes more than ample time to stop and smell the Yahse wildflowers, she reserves little of her patience for dealing with the continent's fauna. Considering her penchant for whispering sweet nothings to greenery at the expense of communication with her red-blooded compatriots, it comes as no surprise that Ikhi Askamot vows to fight against the colonization movement tooth and claw.${prompt};
Chero-Machero:;
The current minister of commerce and the representative from the Order of Gorney, Chero-Machero's tongue is as smooth as silk when crooning to potential allies, but sharper than any wasp's stinger when his interlocutor is on the other side of an argument. Never one to sink quietly into the quicksand of mediocrity, his nonpareil business sense enabled him to transform a struggling city into a mercantile metropolis rivaling Jeuno.${prompt};
Increased trade with the other Vana'dielian continents and the construction of island workshops are just two of the many strokes of commercial genius with which he has blessed Adoulin.${prompt};
He was also the mastermind behind the plan to recruit adventurers from the Middle Lands as pioneers, which has only made the bad blood between him and Gratzigg curdle more quickly.${prompt};
Margret:;
Younger than even the grand chancellor, Margret also happens to be his childhood friend. The two were often chided by Ygnas's father for their relentless treks up and down the halls of Castle Adoulin in search of adventure and finding the next mystery to uncover. Such qualities may indeed be one of the reasons why she was able to become the Order of Haverton's leader and subsequently assume the position of Scouts' Coalition maester.${prompt};
Though a genius in her own right, she applies her unparalleled powers of inference and deduction to the fields of exploration and intelligence gathering. Her extraordinary mental capacity has garnered her numerous accolades for deeds performed during surveys of the Ulbukan wilds, which--coupled with her long-standing relationship with Ygnas--could very well be a driving force behind her decision to support the pioneering effort.${prompt};
Lhe Lhangavo:;
Hardly the most sociable of Adoulin's assembly members, she cannot even find common ground with the other Mithra representative. Lhe's legendary lack of congeniality extends beyond the political realm, however, as even her subordinates make it a habit to avoid her--lest they be buried in the mounds of work she piles upon them.${prompt};
Due to her role at the Order of Karieyh's forefront, she is granted the honor of leading the Pioneers' Coalition. Therefore, it is hardly a question as to which side she places herself on the issue of colonization. In fact, she frequently bushwhacks her way to the front lines and throws herself straight into the fray, eliminating terrain obstacles and destroying the lairs of savage beasts that stand in the way of colonial progress.${prompt};
Gratzigg:;
This mountain of a Galka boasts the most muscular figure of all the guardsmen in the Peacekeepers' Coalition and has an ironclad sense of justice to match. An austere disciplinarian and strict moralist, his unconditional love of his nation and ardent desire to maintain harmony amongst the populace are the exact qualities needed for a man in his position in the Order of Vocane.${prompt};
"A perfectionist to the utmost degree, it matters not whether he is risking life and limb in the Ulbukan jungle or patrolling the streets of Adoulin before sunrise; should he see someone even carving their name upon the cobblestones, he will spring into action and detain the offending citizen. His unyielding nature does little to help the tenuous ties he shares with the minister of commerce, however, and the two are so diametrically opposed concerning the colonization movement that fisticuffs have almost been unleashed at the assembly more than once.${prompt}";
Flaviria:;
The most prominent personage in the Order of Thurandaut and the maester of the Mummers' Coalition, Flaviria lacks not for wit--though it may be a tad dry for most people. She also spends many a day out and about the city, testing her latest quip on passersby. It is likely that no one else in the Sacred City possesses a greater love of and flare for comedy than her.${prompt};
A notable miser, Flaviria usually spends her bayld on only the most basic of necessities and never jumps into any deal headfirst. She trusts the minister of commerce's judgment, however, and the two routinely engage in business ventures together. The subject of the pioneering movement is no different, and she stands proudly alongside Chero-Machero in support of cultivating the untamed wilds for the sake of all Adoulinians.${prompt};
Reginald:;
The most taciturn of Adoulin's twelve assembly members, not much is known about Reginald. Much has been made of how he has revolutionized the transportation of cargo as the head of the Couriers' Coalition and Order of Shneddick, but none know exactly how he finds his inspiration.${prompt};
Fittingly, he also lets his actions speak louder than his words when it comes to supporting the colonization movement.${prompt};
Amchuchu:;
Far ahead of her time, it is a wonder that such a massive brain can be crammed into her small Tarutaru frame. As the maester of the Inventors' Coalition and the leader of the Order of Orvail, she has made innumerable contributions to the welfare of the nation through her many marvelous creations.${prompt};
She has already accomplished so much, however, that she must wait impatiently for the continent to catch up--a fact which causes no end to her consternation. When not tinkering away in the coalition headquarters on her next unconventional contrivance, she voices her support for the pioneering effort--of which she has much time to do, seeing as how she must often wait for her foreign materials and technology to arrive.${prompt};
At least she has a new pupil from the Middle Lands with whom to bide her time.${prompt};
Vortimere:;
Working tirelessly to spread the good word of Altana, Vortimere occupies the highest rank that any priory member can aspire to obtain--archexorcist. As the exorcists fall under the minister of judication's jurisdiction, he represents the Order of Weatherspoon alongside Hildebert. Though he may be the most influential missionary in all of Ulbuka, he lacks a certain verbal charisma, often stumbling over his words and pausing to collect his thoughts during assembly meetings.${prompt};
This reputation seems to precede him, as commoners who have only heard of Vortimere's idiosyncrasies can instantly recognize him by the bottomless canyon etched into his brow. He never leaves his abode without some sort of thick treatise on sorcery tucked snugly under his arm, and he can often be seen poring over the rumpled pages yellowed with use of whatever tome he currently possesses.${prompt};
Arciela V. Adoulin:;
The younger sister of Ygnas, Arciela is next in line to succeed the Order of Adoulin and chancellorship. While extremely well-behaved and the manifestation of propriety in front of an audience, she has a wild side that compels her to conduct impromptu surveys in the depths of the forbidden forest alone.${prompt};
Interestingly, it is not her elder brother, but she who has inherited the founder king's treasured weapon Ortharsyne. The blade only leaves her side when she draws it upon her foes, and her refusal to part with it has given rise to rumors that she sleeps in a special position to accommodate her belt and sheath.${prompt};
Never one to use her social status as an excuse to trample over the downtrodden, she treats all with respect and familiarity--including her three maidservants: Grennith, Fremilla, and Cynthia.${prompt};
This warm nature has earned her the admiration of the vast majority of Adoulin's populace, and many refer to her by the moniker “princess.”${prompt};
Having recently been anointed as the leader of the Order of Adoulin, Arciela is charged with leading the Sacred City of Adoulin to even greater prosperity as its one true leader both in name and in practice.${prompt};
Ingrid:;
An exorcist from the Order of Weatherspoon, Ingrid is known through the city to have a heart of ice and a tongue of fire.${prompt};
She has made a name throughout the priory for her knowledge of purgation rituals wherein she uses implements symbolizing the power of Adoulin to rid people and places of ill spirits that haunt them. This expert knowledge comes from her vast wealth of experience, as she has successfully performed over fifty such rites.${prompt};
She refuses to tolerate those with lackadaisical personalities or who cut corners, and her relationships with others are often strained.${prompt};
Still, her own record is not without blemish. A ritual gone wrong once caused the order to lose faith in her talents, but over time this came to be viewed as an anomaly, and she has both regained her honor and claimed a position as one of the most storied exorcists in the city.${prompt};
Adoulin:;
The most densely populated city in Ulbuka, it is also the heart of the alliance that binds all the continent's settlements together.${prompt};
Situated on the very precipice of Ulbuka's eastern seaboard, the geographically rent metropolis is sewn together by Big Bridge, which connects the Adoulin archipelago to the east and the mainland to the west.${prompt};
The eastern district fans out from Castle Adoulin, acting as both the administrative center of the city and a residential haven for the nobility. Spacious manses line the streets and the who's who of Adoulin can be seen leisurely strolling by, taking in the sights and sounds. In contrast, the western district serves as the hub of the colonization movement, with its most striking feature being the hustle and bustle of pioneers hailing from lands far away.${prompt};
Rala Waterways:;
Spanning both Eastern and Western Adoulin, this underground series of gargantuan tunnels directs the flow of water throughout the city through the use of heavy wooden sluice gates.${prompt};
Built when the city was first established, it finally underwent renovation approximately two hundred years ago, when architects greatly improved upon the original design. No one was able to completely annihilate the ferocious beasts that lurk deep within, however, and certain sections of the waterways remain sealed off to prevent these hellions from wreaking havoc on the public.${prompt};
Ceizak Battlegrounds:;
Beyond the guarding gaze of Jorius Yett lie the Ceizak Battlegrounds, a dense stretch of jungle serving as the symbol of Western Adoulin.${prompt};
Species of vermin never before seen in the Middle Lands call the battlegrounds home and, together with enormous trees impeding any sense of progress, pose an obstacle for intrepid pioneers to overcome. No colonization effort has any hope of succeeding without first breaking the land free from the stranglehold of its twisted grasp.${prompt};
Yahse Hunting Grounds:;
Partly exposed to the thrashing waves of the desolate Senroh Sea, the hunting grounds are a second expanse of jungle located adjacent to the Ceizak Battlegrounds and can be accessed via boat from Eastern Adoulin.${prompt};
Perhaps in part due to the similar topography, flora, and fauna, many pioneers have lost their way when traversing between the two. Enormous trees dominate the landscape, their twisted roots serving as a grim reminder that humanity is not welcome within.${prompt};
Foret de Hennetiel:;
The Foret de Hennetiel--the lowest-lying area in all of Eastern Ulbuka--is known throughout all Adoulin as a harsh, punishing environment where neither people nor animals had been able to tread for hundreds of years due to the contamination of the Zoldeff River that flows through it.${prompt};
Yet nature herself eventually reclaims all that has been sullied, which has led to a blossoming of all manner of fascinating plant life hitherto unseen. Settling this wilderness poses yet another issue the Adoulinians must overcome.${prompt};
Morimar Basalt Fields:;
Pioneers who brave the dank and treacherous Moh Gates are greeted with a sight just as grisly as that in the basalt fields. Crusted magma vomited from the mouths of the region's countless volcanoes covers the ground in wrinkled, sludge-gray masses.${prompt};
Despite the gelid climate, the scalding water that spews forth from the area's myriad springs makes it almost impossible for more than a single ilm of snow to accumulate. Thus, though vegetation is scarce, the snow barely provides any respite for the eyes. About the only living creatures in this glacial clime are the lizards that stalk adventurers with a starved determination.${prompt};
Yorcia Weald:;
Situated above the Cirdas Caverns, Yorcia Weald flourishes with a cornucopia of ancient vegetation that remains fundamentally unchanged since before the time of the founder king. While the battlegrounds and hunting grounds each contain dense groves of verdant trees, those of Yorcia Weald grow so close together that their collective canopy keeps the forest floor shrouded in darkness.${prompt};
This atmosphere proves to be an ideal breeding ground for a vast array of menacing wildlife, perverted by the poisons that endlessly seep from the caverns below. This climate is particularly kind to plantoids, as they can be seen swishing through breaks in the trees throughout the weald.${prompt};
Marjami Ravine:;
Many ridges meander back and forth across this natural terrace adjoining the Dho Gates, but the swift-flowing river that runs from north to south cleaves the land the deepest by far.${prompt};
A veritable aviary, the ravine serves as the habitat for birds of all types of plumage. Though there may be few natural impediments in the area, filthy Velkk encampments sully the leafy green color emitted by the grasses, shrubs, and even the occasional tree that brightens the rocky ridges there.${prompt};
Sih Gates:;
The gates are famous as home to all types of grisly foes around its large rocks and within its limestone caves. The roots of the gigantic arbors found in the hunting grounds and battlegrounds protrude from the rocks, choking what remains of the treaded paths and preventing easy passage.${prompt};
Many species of fungi line the walls and floor of the caves, but they are not fit for consumption, and as such can provide little succor. The population of the vile acuexes within has been multiplying, and with pioneers forced to fight in such close quarters, antitoxins are a must for survival.${prompt};
Moh Gates:;
The Moh Gates are a dungeon connecting Ceizak Battlegrounds with Morimar Basalt Fields. Serving as a stark contrast to the frigid fields, waves of red-hot magma churn in the depths below--a chilling testament to the destructive force that nature can be.${prompt};
In some places, sizzling hot springs bubble just above the surface, to which many pioneers pay regular visits to recover from their weary days. Yet with the vicious matamata lying in wait just along the outskirts, any respite is short-lived.${prompt};
Cirdas Caverns:;
This labyrinthine subterranean expanse connects the Sih and Moh Gates below Yorcia Weald, though entering it provides little sense of joy for pioneers, as traversing the gigantic gnarled tree roots makes crossing even the widest passageway an exercise in patience and stamina.${prompt};
The caverns are home to funguars and mosses as poisonous as they are vibrant, and they eventually corrupt all lifeforms that desperately cling to their cursed walls. Its tenebrous atmosphere also enables umbrils to skulk about the caverns' vast rocky interior at all times, instead of appearing only during the witching hours--as they do in front of Adoulinians venturing out into the city's surroundings.${prompt};
Dho Gates:;
Being connected to Cirdas Caverns as well as Marjami Ravine and Foret de Hennetiel, it is surprising that the Dho Gates do not cause a larger number of pioneers to lose their way and eventually perish than is currently reported.${prompt};
The saving grace of this harsh underground passage is its abundance of water. Rainwater from Marjami Ravine gathers to form rivers and plummets from sheer cliffs, creating stunning waterfalls. Water from the Senroh Sea even finds its way into the Dho Gates, giving birth to a subterranean lake. The Gates are also home to hordes of Velkk, who have scattered both outposts and tunnels throughout the area.${prompt};
Kamihr Drifts:;
The Kamihr Drifts are a snow-covered land at the base of Mt. Kamihr, located beyond the dreary walls of the Woh Gates. Its harsh conditions have long prevented entry into its chilling embrace.${prompt};
Beasts of all kinds have adapted to the atmosphere, which serves as yet another barrier to the progress of colonization.${prompt};
Woh Gates:;
The Woh Gates run from north to south, linking Marjami Ravine, Morimar Basalt Fields, and Kamihr Drifts.${prompt};
From the warm area in the south that serves as home to Velkk tribes to the ice-covered walls of the north, the caves are notable for remarkable differences in temperature. What's more, unexplored ruins have stood within the deepest recesses of the cave for countless generations.${prompt};
Outer Ra'Kaznar:;
Little is known about this bewildering edifice that stands amongst the recesses of Kamihr Drifts: not the materials used to erect its sturdy walls, not the identity of the sorcery that adds an uncanny sheen to the building's door, and certainly not why it was constructed.${prompt};
What has been empirically proven is that treading upon its interior is an invitation to death. Phantoms that need not their heads to disembowel trespassers account for but a tiny portion of the grotesqueries that lurk within its subterranean chambers. As may be self-evident at this juncture, not a soul has yet to fully detail the floor plans of this structure.${prompt};
Leafallia:;
Nestled beyond a craggy passageway situated within Kamihr Drifts, this cozy little village is an oasis of verdure amidst the expanse of cold, whitewashed snowbanks that composes the surrounding area. One glance at the vivid foliage and the bright moss laid out upon the forest floor there should soothe one's spirit, no matter how weary.${prompt};
As the name implies, it also serves as the home of those rascally leafkin. Countless academics the continent over have been searching for this secluded copse in hopes of understanding how these bushy bulbs interact with each other.${prompt};
Ra'Kaznar Inner Court:;
Accessible by vertical transit devices, this section lies deep within the bowels of Ra'Kaznar and holds even more mysteries than the outer portion. How its hallways are able to remain afloat above impenetrable darkness is anyone's guess.${prompt};
Though nary a survey has been conducted here as of the time of this writing, this much is clear: exercise extreme caution upon entering its perimeter.${prompt};
Platea Triumphus:;
Multiple roads emanate from all angles of this plaza that lies at the center of Western Adoulin. The origin of this peculiar moniker dates back to a time before Jorius Yett was erected. Prior to when the city was heavily walled from all sides and a thick gate was needed to protect the citizenry from the terrors of Eastern Ulbuka, processions of soldiers returning home from a triumphant battle would be greeted by thankful settlers here.${prompt};
Fontis Xanira:;
Named after Xanira, the stalwart Hume who was the first knight in what came to be the Order of Janniston, this fountain in Platea Triumphus gushes water that would be--were it not liquid--clean enough to eat off.${prompt};
Jorius Yett:;
Erected two centuries ago when the city expanded onto the mainland, this steadfast gate that towers above the streets repels any invaders who dare attack Western Adoulin via Ceizak Battlegrounds. Its eponymous knight, Jorius, proved himself in the eyes of the founder king and became the first knight in what gestated into the Order of Weatherspoon.${prompt};
Airship Docks:;
Of little interest to civilians since no passenger airships alight there, this terminal is used exclusively for the transport of freight. There is little else to mention about this rotunda, except that it lies in the north of Western Adoulin.${prompt};
Adoulin Waterfront:;
This humble port situated in the northwest of Western Adoulin was integral to turning an isolated settlement into a thriving maritime center of trade. Freight ships may have had the largest impact on the development of the sacred city, but fishing boats also patron its waters, with the heavy traffic of smaller vessels forming momentary patterns upon the bay in their wake.${prompt};
Senroh Sea:;
Invaluable to couriers and merchants who wish to fatten their coinpurses abroad, the Senroh Sea contains the archipelago many Ulbukan inhabitants refer to as the Adoulin Islands. To the east of this raging ocean lies the Sea of Zafmlug, the ebb and flow of whose currents creates the perfect conditions for raising the most succulent of seafare.${prompt};
The currents are a double-edged sword, however, and many a ship has left port only to capsize in the sea's turbulent waters or be heaved in directions unknown.${prompt};
Big Bridge:;
This colossal structure is a monument to mankind's ingenuity. Spanning the Senroh Sea to connect Eastern and Western Adoulin, the fact that historical accounts attest to its existence before even the founder king only adds to the bridge's mystique.${prompt};
Castle Adoulin:;
Providing a beacon to all who enter Eastern Adoulin, Castle Adoulin stands on the fringe of the city's more opulent district. It was the obvious home of the Adoulin family when the king still held absolute power, but even after the king abdicated and the alliance was approved, the Adoulins retain control over their historical manse.${prompt};
Celennia Memorial Library:;
The entirety of the Scouts' Coalition's archives is on display here and can be viewed by anyone who meets the proper requirements. The building's name comes from the time of the founder king, when an envoy from Rhazowa calling herself Celennia Wexworth visited these lands and imparted stores of knowledge upon the people of this realm.${prompt};
Goddess Promenade:;
A statue of Altana stands prominently in the center of this grassy mall, arms open wide in a welcoming gesture. Two canals flank this popular spot to indulge in reverie, and a café run by a rather eccentric individual borders the commons to the north.${prompt};
Legend states that the Goddess herself once appeared before an Adoulinian sculptor on his visit to the Middle Lands. After viewing her holy visage in an ancient tomb deep within the forest, divine inspiration took hold of his hands and never relinquished its grip. He spent the remainder of his life meticulously chiseling the majestic statue that graces us now.${prompt};
Café des Larmes:;
Never in want of customers, pioneers and civilians alike populate the tables of this quaint establishment day in and day out. The owner, renowned for his peculiar speech patterns and mannerisms, decided the café would take an open-terrace approach to dining, meaning there are no indoor seats of which to speak.${prompt};
Coronal Esplanade:;
The open area that rests atop Sverdhried Hillock is named Coronal Esplanade after the piece of art containing dual circles that adorns the gates to Castle Adoulin. Some speculate the reason it has such a pompous name as opposed to a more commonplace one such as “Sun Plaza” is that the grand estates that line the courtyard all belong to the nobility, but these claims are naught but rumors.${prompt};
Sverdhried Hillock:;
Its name taken from the grandfather of the runic arts, this lofty hill bisects Eastern Adoulin. Sverdhried's contributions are of incontrovertible importance to the prosperity of Adoulin, but records suggest the hillock was named after him not for his good deeds, but because he climbed it multiple times each day to increase his endurance.${prompt};
Silver Knife:;
This peculiar auction house in Eastern Adoulin services only a certain clientele, but what exactly makes one part of that clientele is a tightly guarded secret.${prompt};
Exorcist Priory:;
Exorcists call this sanctum home, and when they are not sojourning in the Middle Lands to force Pyracmon back from whence he came, they can be found seeking guidance from the Goddess, honing their techniques, and training both their minds and bodies here. The priory was constructed next to the Order of Weatherspoon so that the minister of judication and the order itself could exert their authority over its occupants all the easier.${prompt};
Mog Gardens:;
Little slices of pastoral paradise, mog gardens are parcels of land apportioned to pioneers for their service to Adoulin. They sit upon the various tiny islets that dot the Senroh Sea, but do not be deceived by their size. They have all the resources a seasoned explorer could ever need--provided he is willing to reap what he sows.${prompt};
Civic Arboretum:;
All produce sold at the farmers' market aboveground is grown in this subterranean greenhouse within the Rala Waterways. Owned and operated by the city, all its profits are used for improving the quality of the vegetables the staff there grows.${prompt};
This task has proven to be a mighty one indeed, for the lack of direct sunlight severely impairs the development of plants. The Inventors' Coalition has been kind enough to provide stimulating agents that drastically enhance seasonal yields, thereby taking the first step toward solving the city's food shortage.${prompt};
Watergarden Coliseum:;
Should an irreconcilable dispute arise between two parties, or should one's gladiatorial prowess need be proven upon a fellow man, this is the spot where the duel shall be held. Combatants cannot simply waltz into the stadium, however, as the proper paperwork must be officially notarized before any sparring can take place.${prompt};
It is debatable as to whether this policy is responsible for the rapid decline in human combatants, but either way, the only applications the coliseum has received of late come from the Mummers' Coalition. Noble and plebeian alike are welcome to attend their raptor fights, and these tests of raw, bestial skill have garnered quite the following as of this writing.${prompt};
The Naakuals:;
Though Ulbuka is crawling with incalculable numbers of fearsome beasts, the seven most bloodthirsty hellions that reign over the wilds surrounding Adoulin are known as Naakuals.${prompt};
Fiercely territorial and short of temper, it's no wonder that they have little compassion for pioneers who try to develop these primordial lands. As the Naakuals possess powers greater than many adventurers can even fathom, it stands to reason that the vast majority of layfolk dare not approach them. Even the most foolhardy or valiant of pioneers have yet to lay eyes on all seven.${prompt};
Colkhab, The Matriarch Naakual:;
An exoskeleton harder than any armor ever conceived by mankind and a seemingly infinite supply of venomous stingers round out this queen bee's vicious armaments. The ominous drone of her heavily beating wings can be heard throughout the jungles of the Yahse Hunting Grounds and the Ceizak Battlegrounds, instilling both fear and awe in the vermin that reside there. ${prompt};
Colkhab can call upon a tempestuous gale to protect her at a moment's notice, and a simple twitch of her legs can unleash cyclonic blasts so strong that they rend one's sinews in twain. Paired with the armory of needles stored in her abdomen, she could conceivably cut down legions of foes from all directions in less than a heartbeat. Assuming one can survive this initial onslaught of wind-whipped blades, the poison harbored within each and every stinger is strong enough to incapacitate even the most hulking Galka. Once the poison's effect takes hold, there is naught any may do but gape in a soundless scream as scavenger insects slowly devour their living corpse.${prompt};
Achuka, the Firebrand Naakual:;
Achuka is so hot-tempered that magma supposedly courses through its saurian veins--a trait it may very well use to its advantage in ruling over the lizards that inhabit the Morimar Basalt Fields. This monstrosity was seemingly bred for slaughter. With claws that emit searing heat, fangs that can fell the largest of trees, horns tougher and sharper than any katana, and crimson scales reminiscent of bloodshed, there's no part of its body that cannot be used as a weapon.${prompt};
Add space-distorting waves of heat to the long list of its predatory arsenal and it would seem nary an adventurer alive could stop it. No matter how thick one's armor or strong one's sorcery may be, they amount to no more than kindling before Achuka's blazing flames. As if that weren't enough, the monster's ear-shattering roar is so terrifying that it forces even battle-hardened adventurers to assume the fetal position while they relentlessly unleash cries for mercy...which of course do little but fall on deaf ears.${prompt};
Tchakka, the Riptide Naakual:;
The massive stone blade that adorns this shark-like creature's head is harder than any metal and does an ample job proving just how ghastly this beast is. Tchakka trawls the waters of Foret de Hennetiel in constant search of prey while maintaining a tight grip upon the local aquan populace, which reveres the rockfin as their leader.${prompt};
More than proficient at manipulating its underwater habitat, Tchakka can instantaneously envelop transgressors in a thousand flashes of blinding light and cleave their flesh clean off with one stroke of its aquatic cutlass, thus ensuring the safety of the forest. Should adventurers endeavor to turn the tide of battle against this monolithic beast, they would most certainly have to tread carefully in this riverbed sabre dance.${prompt};
Yumcax, the Ligneous Naakual:;
The lush canopy of foliage that protrudes from its crown casts an ominous shadow that extenuates its enormous size. Already more massive than a normal Hume, its ability to levitate and float effortlessly between the groves of trees that define Yorcia Weald further instills fear in those who glimpse this arboreal abomination.${prompt};
Able to snap its bark-covered limbs like whips, there is little doubt that this hovering harbinger of doom uses them to subjugate the hordes of plantoids in the area as well as to teach impertinent pioneers who truly reigns over the woods of Ulbuka. Indeed, there are few of any mortal kind who are not as babes beside Yumcax, who has reigned in the weald for centuries upon centuries.${prompt};
Hurkan, the Booming Naakual:;
Ruler of all birds in the Marjami Ravine, it would take no stretch of the imagination to say that Hurkan owns the skies. This aerial acrobat's beak can sever flesh faster than any craklaw pincer, and can take a more thorough beating than the Ulbukan coastline.${prompt};
Hurkan's very wingflaps send baleful peals of thunder that resound off canyon walls and inundate one's eardrums. Accompanying this onslaught, in flashes of violent violet, is lightning capable of incinerating entire trees in an instant.${prompt};
Kumhau, the Flashfrost Naakual:;
Naakuals, the most fearsome of beasts that reside in the jungles, are present in all corners of the Ulbukan continent--and the Kamihr Drifts are no exception.${prompt};
Its fangs glint in the light as if they were of pure platinum, its flesh like a plate of armor forged of the hardest steel. Yet with only scattered sightings having been reported, none are sure which of the stories are true and which are overblown hyperbole.${prompt};
Leafkin (Plantoid):;
Their appearance resembles a coconut wrapped in layers upon layers of leaves. They pose little harm to pioneers, and can often be seen wandering aimlessly through the woods.${prompt};
Their adorable features have garnered them much attention, and they are perhaps the only species of creature in Eastern Ulbuka that evokes positive emotions from Adoulinians. Despite their immense fame, little is known of their behavior or population numbers.${prompt};
They have been sighted planting trees, playing pranks on unsuspecting pioneers, and squaring off against umbrils, which leads scholars to believe that leafkin are roughly equivalent to forest nymphs or guardian spirits.${prompt};
The only discovery that may provide any degree of insight into their social makeup is that they apparently have a leader who dwells deep within the furthest reaches of the forest.${prompt};
Velkk (Beastmen):;
These notoriously ruthless savages have set up their base of operations in the west of Eastern Ulbuka. According to records of old, they once lived throughout the various islands that constitute the Adoulinian archipelago, but were forced further and further west as the founder king's influence grew.${prompt};
Velkk fighters can be classified into two broad types: bellicose warriors who desire only to massacre their foes in the most bloody way imaginable, and devoted practitioners of the black arts who delight in using their spells to gain the upper hand in battle. Yet despite all this, they are also adorably idiotic, so it is difficult to harbor much ill will against them.${prompt};
Twitherym (Vermin):;
Do not be deceived by the majestic hue and intricate choreographic magic these butterflies exhibit--their bite certainly matches their beauty. They mainly live outdoors, but specific strains have been known to inhabit dungeons throughout Ulbuka in addition to their purple brethren.${prompt};
Chapuli (Vermin):;
This particular species of vermin makes its home in the Yahse Hunting Grounds and Ceizak Battlegrounds. Pay close attention to the horns protruding from their heads, for they can cut through foes cleaner than a Far Eastern katana. Their towering leaps and breakneck speed can leave even the most adroit of adventurers befuddled.${prompt};
Matamatas (Lizard):;
Thickly wooded groves and tropical regions play host to these reptilian monstrosities, whose quaint moniker extenuates their ponderous size. They may seem like slow-moving creatures, but try telling that to the few pioneers who have survived the rapid succession of lashings dealt to them by a matamata tail. That's hardly their only weapon, however, as they can also expel internally boiled water at unbelievable velocities.${prompt};
Heartwings (Elemental):;
Scattered reports of heartwing sightings have come in from all corners of Eastern Ulbuka, and those who have seen these affable spirits in person note that they enjoy drifting about harmlessly and trailing after pioneers. It may be difficult to discern any logical behavioral patterns from these enigmatic creatures, but almost all their witnesses agree that there is nothing cuter on the whole continent than a fluttering heartwing. However, what follows after espying a heartwing usually sends chills down one's spine rather than inflaming one's passions...${prompt};
Craklaws (Aquan):;
Aquans through and through, craklaws make their homes in the rivers and deltas of Eastern Ulbuka. Their gigantic claws can slice boulders in half like knives through Selbina butter, and their massive stony shells spurn even the most carefully crafted weapons without suffering a scratch. It would be no exaggeration to label them as moving underwater fortresses.${prompt};
Acuexes (Amorph):;
Acuexes have spread throughout Eastern Ulbuka's underground regions, and many a witness has come forth to attest to the acridness of the poisonous gas they spout. Little is known about these miniscule monsters, except that they multiply rapidly and gather in the nooks and crannies of caves as well as their walls. Scientists have tried proving that the miasma acuexes spout is related to the spores of mushrooms, but so far have met only with failure.${prompt};
Umbrils (Elemental):;
As their name suggests, umbrils skulk amongst the shadows, shrouded in mysteries as opaque as their natural habitat.${prompt};
Records from ancient scrolls confirm their existence in Eastern Ulbuka since long ago, yet details regarding their behavior are few and far between--the most terrifying of which is that they can glide through earth and walls with nary a thought.${prompt};
No wonder they are most widely known only as the “Jungle's Curse.”${prompt};
Snapweeds (Plantoid):;
Their preferred method of predation consists of patiently waiting for their victims to crawl inside the huge jar-shaped mouth formed from their foliage. Once they shut their leafy traps, there is no escape for their insectoid prey, but the digestive juices that churn violently inside their bulbous jaws have devastating effects upon pioneers as well.${prompt};
Tulfaires (Bird):;
Their cruor-red plumage paints a fearful picture for pioneers who glance up at the skies over Eastern Ulbuka only to see them descend at breakneck speeds, talons bared and beak pursed.${prompt};
Lucerewes (Beasts):;
Take more than two steps into the Kamihr Drifts and you are bound to encounter one of these sheep-like creatures. Incredibly docile and meek, lucerewes often have an affinity for pioneers who cross their paths.${prompt};
Ovim (Beasts):;
Despite being members of the sheep family, ovim are much bigger than their lucerewe cousins, and their ornery disposition makes them formidable foes.${prompt};
Raaz (Beasts):;
Boar-like creatures notable for the sharp white fangs protruding from the corners of their mouths, raaz have a voracious appetite for flora and fauna alike. Their powerful leg muscles enable them to charge forward at speeds that put even the most lithe of felines to shame.${prompt};
Dullahans (Undead):;
These headless apparitions clad shoulder to toe in thick plated armor aimlessly wander the expanse of Ra'Kaznar, gigantic axe and shield in hand. Their behavior is as disconcerting as their appearance, and the rare survivors of these phantasmal encounters describe them as being as inscrutably enigmatic as they are deadly.${prompt};
Fluturinis (Vermin):;
Less scrupulous scholars describe these vividly winged vermin as enlarged twitherym grown too massive to feasibly coexist with others in a swarm. While this may amount to nothing more than specious speculation, all agree that their only known sightings have been in the confines of Ra'Kaznar.${prompt};
This shelf is packed with tomes chronicling the historical events that took place within the Sacred City of Adoulin.${prompt};

In the year 880, the leader of the Order of Adoulin, Ygnas S. Adoulin, declared the continent of Ulbuka open to colonization.${prompt};
His fiat proved controversial, as the Twelve Orders quickly became divided over the issue.${prompt};

A hundred years after the Great Expedition came to a close, Adoulin's leaders were still plagued by the numerous burdens the era had left on their city.${prompt};
Faced with mass poverty and the eventual collapse of their nation, the king and the eleven order representatives debated furiously for days on end on how to rectify their plight. It was only a matter of time before they would realize the only recourse left to them was to form an alliance.${prompt};
Thus, the long-standing dynasty erected by the founder king was torn down, and out of the political rubble came the Sacred City of Adoulin. Established to both further the economic prospects of the nation as well as to quell its upstart rivals, this merger of the archipelago's various settlements signaled a new beginning for the continent.${prompt};
In the year 673, the Great Expedition came to a close.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was promulgated, and work on the monstrous western wall of the city--termed Jorius Yett--came to a head. The denizens of this island capital had but one choice--huddle meekly behind the thick city walls or face the untamed wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt};
A reconnaissance mission by the shrewd Ceizak revealed the presence of a beast shrouded in wind and thunder violating the sanctity of the Ulbukan wildlands.${prompt};
August deemed it to be an ill omen rather than the mere roaming of a jungle denizen, and ordered an expeditionary force formed to cull the beast. Leading the charge, the founder king confronted the danger head-on and swore to subjugate the menace.${prompt};
Rala Renaye and her regiment broke from the vanguard in an advance force to skirmish with the beast. Despite suffering heavily in the onslaught, the geomancer refused to relent and erected a geomantic sphere to bolster her forces.${prompt};
As the main force arrived, Yorcia, the Lady of the Arrow, let loose a hawkshot to pierce the soft underbelly of the stonefleshed being.${prompt};
Sensing blood, Yahse Karieyh dove in might and main before the beast had a chance to recover.${prompt};
August's forces, who had been lying in wait for their time to strike, flanked it from the east, cutting off its only path of retreat.${prompt};
Their foe, however, was undeterred. He conjured up a swirling gale, sending Rala flying, and struck Yahse with a bolt to the heart.${prompt};
Yahse, never one to shrink even in the face of the most grievous of wounds, drove her blade further into the beast's flesh and let loose a victory cry with her last breath.${prompt};

Having vanquished the immediate threat, the generals convened an emergency council and determined that the best course of action would be to prevent its brethren from making inroads toward their main stronghold. They departed the battleground and made haste for a cavernous expanse stretching like tendrils beneath the soil.${prompt};
The valiant order scarce had time to breathe before they found themselves face-to-face with yet another monster, this one the like of which they had never seen.${prompt};
In an age where the only option was to kill or be killed, August and his generals refused to yield any ground as blades flashed and spells dazzled in the air.${prompt};
Would that the beast were alone in the darkened crevice, but as parts of it fell off, they splattered poison on the dry earth--poison that coalesced into tiny versions of the monster that began to multiply at an alarming rate. For every one the heroic force splattered, three more popped up in its place.${prompt};
Cirdas and his force intervened, standing tall and strong against the ever-expanding enemy as the bulk of August's army remained mired in gunk.${prompt};
Cirdas, his guard like an iron wall, could only hold out for so long before he began to falter, and it was all he could do to stave off the relentless assault.${prompt};
The logistics officers were completely drained of energy, with supplies from the backlines all but exhausted. Yorcia and Marjami had fallen, and their soldiers slowly succumbed to the miasma one by one.${prompt};
With her dying breath, Marjami bequeathed all her elemental aptitude to Hennetiel, infusing his lance with the most primal of forces.${prompt};
Like a burning fire raging through a dry summer gust, Hennetiel's blade slashed and raged through the air, each stab more vicious than the last.${prompt};
Purging flame, cleansing rain, rejuvenating wind...Marjami's final words quelled the miasma, causing it to dissipate in a tuft of noxious green.${prompt};
Drenched in the vile ichor, Cirdas collapsed on the ground, his body shuddering twice before falling silent.${prompt};
He was a man of the people, and it was they who carried on his legacy, passing down his deeds of valor for future generations to honor.${prompt};
These memories exist to this day, a folktale known from the highest ministry official down to the lowliest beggar as “The Shield of Adoulin.”${prompt};
During a sojourn to the foot of a nearby mountain, August had the ill fortune of stumbling upon an undead horde.${prompt};
His mind swirled as he realized no reinforcements could reach him in time...only to find himself crossing paths with a man of a most peculiar nature.${prompt};
Clad in a black as dark as the endless void, the man took the puzzling decision of dismissing his army from the field of battle.${prompt};
Even though his forces could surely rout the lone August, he faced the founder king one-on-one, the ringing of steel echoing from foothill to foothill.${prompt};
Yet neither of the two pressed any advantage they won for themselves, their clash more a parley than a test of might.${prompt};
What could the two have been fighting for if not life and honor? How did their chance meeting end?${prompt};
When news that undying armies were marching upon the city reached her citizens, pandemonium ensued as families began hoarding supplies and seeking refuge on the outlying isles.${prompt};
These foreboding tidings would have been bearable in and of themselves, but when further word came that the Velkk had resurfaced, the people's will was utterly broken.${prompt};
Ceizak, who was in the midst of ordering the self-defense soldiers to perform defensive maneuvers, was left flabbergasted as a wall of light burst forth in the sky near the frontlines.${prompt};
Although he would not learn this until later, this wall was a “Light of Purification” spell cast by Jorius.${prompt};
The ceaseless horde dissolved into the aether, down to the last shambling corpse, as the wall pressed forward.${prompt};
Fearing the same fate, the Velkk yelped and howled, running toward the western fringes with their tails between their legs.${prompt};
Jorius had burned every onz of magic left within his frail shell, and, although Ceizak called out to him in triumph...${prompt};
...his words were never returned.${prompt};
August P. Adoulin:;
Known colloquially in the present day as “The Founder King,” his martial prowess was matched only by his undeniable charisma and steadfast love of the people. Nary a child in Adoulin grows up without being told tales of his numerous exploits.${prompt};
His grace and lightning-quick reflexes led him to be known in his age as “the knight of the swallow,” and his order took up that symbol to honor his memory.${prompt};
Guntram Woltaris:;
Quick of mind and sharp of wit, Guntram invented the predecessor for what later generations would term “waypoints,” and stationed them through the Ulbukan hinterlands.${prompt};
In recognition of his ability to churn out new ideas like a tree shedding its leaves in autumn, his disciples took on the symbol of the leaf for their order.${prompt};
The waypoints currently enjoyed by pioneers and supporting staff are, as alluded to, the latest in a long string of improvements dating back to their original incarnations centuries ago.${prompt};
Unsurprisingly, the Inventors' Coalition has taken it upon itself to further the accuracy and reliability of the devices, and recent advances have seen the successful teleportation rate climb to 99.9%.${prompt};
Jorius Weatherspoon:;
With a command over the spiritual and a dedication to stamping out the profane, Jorius is viewed by leading academics as the first of the modern-day exorcists.${prompt};
The pillar of light he conjured was said to stretch up in the sky like a butterfly fluttering toward the sun, so it was only natural for his followers to use the same imagery in their crest.${prompt};
Although scholars continue to debate the exact nature of this “Light of Purification,” the prevailing theory is that it bears a striking resemblance to what became known in Mindartia and Quon as “Holy.”${prompt};
"Jorius Yett takes its moniker from this storied general; much as the Light of Purification protected Adoulin in its time of need, so, too, does the yett stand to shield Adoulin from harm.${prompt}";
Xanira Janniston:;
Preferring the backlines to the fray, Xanira often found herself tending to the ill, her mystical prowess mending wounds with nary a needle or suture.${prompt};
This is not to say she was a stranger to more traditional arts, as she had undergone years of training herself, but none could compare to her deftness at getting wounded soldiers battle-ready once more.${prompt};
Knowing that she was always prepared to send them back in fighting form, frontline warriors found themselves feeling invincible.${prompt};
Broken bones and shattered spirits were but a small obstacle for her to overcome, and countless were those who owed their lives to her talents.${prompt};
Her order adopted the symbol of the dewdrop in recognition of the tears of pain Xanira was able to wipe away.${prompt};
Rala Renaye:;
As a descendant of Vana'diel's first geomancer, Sih Renaye, Rala was known for her ability to assert control over the field of battle.${prompt};
Owing to the city's location on the easternmost coast, Adoulinians found themselves with nowhere to flee when the bulk of the Velkk forces invaded from the west.${prompt};
When August made landfall, however, he retaliated with such overwhelming force that the Velkk scattered like ashes in the wind.${prompt};
In awe of the founder king's strategic mind, she offered her services not just as a general, but as a representative of all Adoulin's geomancers.${prompt};
A geomancer is nothing without her keen attunement with the land, and in honor of this bond Rala took up an expanse of grass as her symbol, representing the way flora encompasses and embraces the ground on which it grows.${prompt};
Ceizak Gorney:;
The commissariat of August's armies, Ceizak was in charge of provisioning supplies and performing civil works. Without his efforts, the founder king and his entourage would have never been able to gain footholds into enemy-controlled areas.${prompt};
His list of personal connections was both wide and winding, and as such the symbol of the snake came to be associated with all his actions.${prompt};
Yorcia Haverton:;
A master of all things intelligence, Yorcia prided herself on being able to wring information from rock and water, the living and the unliving, the reticent and the loose of tongue. She was also a skilled assassin, striking at her foes before they could utter cries of help.${prompt};
Her flitting from shadow to shadow, always present but never seen, led her followers to adopt the symbol of the raven in her honor.${prompt};
Yahse Karieyh:;
Quick on her feet and skilled in botany, Yahse Karieyh was an expert wilderness survivalist who could construct makeshift shelter from even the smallest of leaves and twigs.${prompt};
Her keen manipulation of her surroundings in clever ways earned the naturalist the affectionate moniker “monkey”--an image that would stay with her order for years to come.${prompt};
Cirdas Vocane:;
A Hume of such height and bulk that from afar he was often mistaken for a Galka, Cirdas commanded his spear so adroitly that on the battlefield his movements were like a swirling tempest.${prompt};
His unflinching presence on the frontlines protecting Adoulin's citizenry from harm led many to call him “The Shield of Adoulin.”${prompt};
Much like the roots of a grand oak tree for which his order was later known, Cirdas always dug deep into the earth and refused to yield ground under the most vicious of assaults.${prompt};
Hennetiel Thurandaut:;
A morale specialist, when Hennetiel wasn't commanding his wyvern in battle, he would perform daring feats and tricks, much to the delight of those with the wind taken out of their sails.${prompt};
His jovial nature made him a natural for such a herculean task, and he and “Izzy” often stayed up until the wee hours of the morning practicing their routine.${prompt};
It was only fitting that after his death his followers took up the symbol of the lizard.${prompt};
Morimar Shneddick:;
Known for his ability to tame the wild beasts of the harsh Ulbukan jungle, Morimar could turn the fauna against the demonic forces that besieged Ulbuka.${prompt};
He often used their primal prowess to guard his regiment's flank and secure lines of provision. This cat-and-mouse style led his order to elect the latter to serve as their symbol.${prompt};
Marjami Orvail:;
Though able to wield the fiercest of elemental powers, Marjami did so not through staff, scepter, or wand, but rather through the power of her blade, which left a faint trail of light as it sliced through scale and flesh.${prompt};
In symbolizing the eight elements that rule Vana'diel, her order took up the crest of the eight-legged spider.${prompt};
Ghalcimus D. Adoulin:;
The former grand chancellor, Ghalcimus led an expeditionary force into the hinterlands and vanished in the year 879.${prompt};
He brought a small entourage of eleven troops, hoping to learn more about the jungle and its perils, but none of the twelve returned.${prompt};
No one has yet found a trace of their bodies or supplies, and the precise location where he vanished is yet unknown.${prompt};
Gramk-Droog the Vanquisher:;
The current king of the Velkk. Scholars debate whether “king” is the appropriate term, as Velkk political structures are believed to be primitive.${prompt};
The title “Vanquisher” is also an Adoulinian term, given to him owing to his endless massacre of swaths of the city's soldiers.${prompt};
Skov-Trok the Instigator:;
When the Velkk were at the height of their power during the time of the founder king, Skov-Trok commanded endless hordes of troops to strike at his foe's weak points.${prompt};
Yet August was undeterred. He attacked swiftly and viciously, driving the Velkk far to the west, where they have remained to the present day.${prompt};
Records indicate that no other Velkk since has reigned as long as he.${prompt};
Soraa Ishakal:;
Leader of the Blackthorn Coven, Soraa's unflinching dedication to her group would be worthy of praise...if the coven were more benevolent.${prompt};
Zunmimi:;
The Tarutaru representative of the Blackthorn Coven, Zunmimi is known for her sarcastic, never-say-die attitude and love of all things wicked.${prompt};
Melisandra:;
The youngest member of the Blackthorn Coven, Melisandra is often concerned with what the others think of her, wondering if she measures up properly.${prompt};
Sih Renaye:;
One of Adoulin's most storied figures who was not one of August's generals, Sih Renaye marked her place in history as Adoulin's first geomancer.${prompt};
It was she who discovered the inexorable link between ergon loci and the lifestream, utilizing their power to cultivate the first geomantic energies.${prompt};
When the Velkk forces collapsed on an outlying settlement, Sih and her five disciples called forth an extraordinary display of geomantic prowess, the sizzling energies shielding the villagers from harm.${prompt};

Sverdhried:;
Often referred to as the father of rune fencing, Sverdhried was a stoic warrior who lived sometime in the early 400s.${prompt};
In a long-forgotten mystical kingdom in the frozen wastes of Rhazowa, Sverdhried gained the ability to use enchanted script known as “runes,” which he combined with his training as a blademaster to develop the art we know today as rune fencing.${prompt};
Having dedicated himself fully to this fusion of religious scripture and swordsmanship, Sverdhried then traveled through Vana'diel's many continents, proselytizing about this newfound way of life. Yet he was not blind in his devotion, and every land he visited sated his curiosity about various ways of life, which he then incorporated into his own training.${prompt};

Terrcualn:;
A tiger whose mane and fur were flecked with gold, Terrcualn was said to fight alongside King August during his most dangerous forays into the Ulbukan continent.${prompt};
In recent years, pioneers and citizens alike have been reporting sightings of a creature remarkably similar in appearance. Could this be the legendary tiger or one of his descendants?${prompt};
Hsss.;
This's the Celennia Memorial Librrrary, and I'm Reja Ygridhi--the one in charge of keeping dust and paw prints off these tomes.${prompt};
The city's fat cats told me I have to cooperate with you pioneers' research and let you trrrack mud all over my beloved building. Honestly, though, I don't want your dirty paws anywhere near my books.${prompt};
Maybe if you show some respect for the wrrritten word first, then I'll have less of a reason to act like a sourpuss. So, you going to rrrun an errand for me or what?${prompt};
Run an errand for her?;
${selection-lines};
To prove my worth? Of course!;
I'm not living under the cat's paw.${prompt};
Then you'd better rrremove yourself from my sight before I claw your face off!${prompt};
Hmph. Maybe you're not so worthless after all.;
I need you to confirm how purrrtinent our information about the Twelve Orders is.${prompt};
How?;
I take it they don't ask you to use your brrrain much out in the jungle, do they?;
Keep putting one of your legs in front of the other until you rrreach each order, that's how.${prompt};
I need you to confirm how accurrrate our information about all the Twelve Orders is.;
Report to me when you're done.${prompt};
I guess you did a good enough job.;
I don't apprrreciate your tone, though. Of course there were mistakes--that's because the documents I gave you are years old.${prompt};
It was all a test, and despite your mouse-sized brain, you were able to surrrpass my expectations.;
See, we don't just shuffle books around here--we also gather intelligence.${prompt};
Whether the intelligence you extrrract is worthy of binding and displaying on these shelves is none of your concern. Just collect as much of it as you can and gain as much experience as possible.${prompt};
Now that I can trrrust you to some extent, I'd rather not have you die. However, certain types of knowledge are more important than the life of one rrreplaceable pioneer.${prompt};
Moreover, it's the information you risk your life for that's always the most crrrucial.${prompt};
Don't worry. I'm not so rrreprobate that I won't compensate you for your hard work.${prompt};
While we're at it, I suppose we can grrrant you access to the shelves of intelligence we've already amassed. Just don't hack up any hairballs on them, got it?${prompt};
Come back after you've prrrocured a member's card from the Scouts' Coalition and talk to me, then you can lose yourself in the worlds each tome crrreates.${prompt};
There you are.;
The library crrraves more information, so go out and get some.${prompt};
That's enough for now.;
Give yourself a scrrratch on the back. I guess we prrroved the saying “Curiosity killed the cat” wrong, huh?${prompt};
There you are.;
I hate to admit it, but your efforts ${choice: 0}[in advancing the alliance/at helping the city's populace/in supporting pioneers/during your coalition assignments] deserve prrraise of some sort.${prompt};
Here's your reward. Now scrrram.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't my favorrrite waste of air. The curator's been raving about all you did for our sacred city, and I've been tasked with giving you a little something.${prompt};
Fine. It's from me, okay!? Just don't go spouting it from the rrrooftops.${prompt};
There you are.;
I hate to admit it, but your efforts investigating the Naakuals deserve prrraise of some sort.${prompt};

Arcane glyptics may be fancy-wancy, but sometimes you want to restore your items to their fresh-off-the-Naakual state.${prompt};
Fortunataruly, I can provide this service to you free of charge. A little hocus-pocus goes a long way! Just trade a cape to me--only one at a time--and I'll remove all magical traces in a snap.${prompt};
Are you absolutaruly sure you wish to remove arcane glyptics from this item?${prompt};
All clear! Sometimes you want pure cloth untainted by needless magic. There's something to be said for fine craftsmanship!${prompt};
This particular tome describes a certain type of vegetation labeled by scholars as the “Ulbukan Greatwood.”${prompt};
Supposedly there existed a certain tree of stupendous height some-odd centuries ago. At least that is what leading researchers in the field propose.${prompt};
They cite the myriad roots of abnormal size scattered across the continent as proof, but I would personally like to see some more evidence before forming my own conclusions...${prompt};
You know about the “founder king,” don't you? Also known as the “first king” and had the name August. Fitting name for a man of his stature.${prompt};
The Order of Adoulin is actually composed of his descendants, but no one from there wields anywhere near the power that August did when he was king.${prompt};
Leave the library?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You've noticed that kits of all kinds have been frequentauring the ${unknown: 0x01053782828280} lately, right?${prompt};
No, no, no! I obviously-wobviously don't mean pioneers. Who'd think odd of that?;
I mean Adoulinian guys and girls.${prompt};
They keep using this strange phrase with each other. All these whippersnappers and their argotaru--why can't they use real words?${prompt};
Speaking of real words, I haven't read a moving love story in a long time. It's fine and all to house records of the city, but there's nothing-wothing here that speaks to the soul!${prompt};
${name-player}? Are you looking for something here, too?${prompt};
What will you ask?;
${selection-lines};
What's bothering you?;
What kind of sweets do you like?;
What kind of guys are you into?${prompt};
You're asking me about...my taste in men?${prompt};
I'm really not in the mood to have this kind of conversation.${prompt};
Am I that easy to read...?;
<Sigh>...I suppose you aren't the only one who's noticed...${prompt};
My what!?${prompt};
Sweets!? My favorite kind of sweets!?${prompt};
Dear princess, please remember that you are in a place of learning.${prompt};
Oh my...please forgive me. I promise to be quieter.${prompt};
<Cough>${prompt};
My, uh...favorite sweets. Right...${prompt};
Maybe chocolate crepes with white honey...or witch nougat smothered with maple sugar.${prompt};
And of course, who can forget gateau aux fraises? The tartness of the berries is just to die for.${prompt};
Grennith always told me that I ate too much and would balloon up like a swamp frog...;
...Wait. Why are we talking about this, again?${prompt};
Why did you broach this topic?;
${selection-lines};
Because I wanted to cheer you up.${prompt};
Well...you certainly did succeed in surprising me.${prompt};
...You were really that concerned about me?${prompt};
Hehe! For at least one moment, you helped me forget my troubles.${prompt};
Whoever would have thought you'd come all this way just to talk to me about desserts!${prompt};
You're always so kind to me, ${name-player}. We'll make sure to get back to this topic later!${prompt};
To be honest, there is something bothering me. Would you mind lending me your ear?${prompt};
It's about my brother. Of course I'm worried what would happen if he never turned back to normal, but it's more than that.${prompt};
Why would he point at me? I've turned it over and over in my head, but I can't find the answer.${prompt};
Every person in the room had their own take on the matter, but I can't shake this feeling that none of them are right.${prompt};
It's like...they're only saying what will help advance their agendas.${prompt};
I don't know what he really meant, but I do know that his words were heartfelt. As they have been ever since we were little children.${prompt};
I just don't understand...what am I supposed to do?${prompt};
Should we keep making inroads into Ulbuka?${prompt};
Or should we give up and withdraw, like the founder king bids?${prompt};
The arguments rage on with increasing viciousness each passing day.${prompt};
What if the city becomes even more divided? What if this breaks into all-out civil war?${prompt};
If that were to happen, whether or not we colonize the continent will seem but a minor squabble.${prompt};
And what's more...I get the feeling that the anomalies happening through Ulbuka are not wholly related to colonization.${prompt};
We've long known that beasts lurk in the jungles--but now there are some creatures that we've never even heard of until recently.${prompt};
Why couldn't my brother be more clear with his guidance?${prompt};
Or is it just as you said? Has his illness progressed to the point where we can't even telepathically communicate with him...and he's become a leafkin in more than just flesh?${prompt};
I-I'm sorry, ${name-player}. All of this is so overwhelming.${prompt};
Try as I might, I cannot unravel these mysteries by myself.${prompt};
That's why I've been coming here for the past few days, hoping to find something. Anything. But once again I've turned up empty-handed.${prompt};
How about your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Has there been any change?${prompt};
I see...;
But I believe in you, ${name-player}. I know you'll be able to read into what he really wants.${prompt};
Rosulatia, the leafkin queen, would not have trusted you if she didn't see some spark there.${prompt};
I have not been able to leave the city walls of late, but you...you must be going to the mainland on a regular basis.${prompt};
Please. If you find something, anything--tell me right away.${prompt};
I'll do what I can here. There's just got to be some tome that...${prompt};
Thank you for making the effort to come find me, ${name-player}. Perhaps I'll finally sleep better tonight.${prompt};
Hello, my dear ${name-player}. Why the long face?${prompt};
Why, yes, I have in fact seen the princess.;
She is right over there, doing what library patrons do.${prompt};
She has recently been rather absorbed in the abnormalities plaguing the hinterland, and has visited our humble archives numerous times these past weeks.${prompt};
As an aside, I believe her current interest lies closer to home. Are you aware of the incident that occurred in town?${prompt};
${name-player}!?;
H-how fortuitous. There's something I wanted to ask you.${prompt};
I know it seems like I'm obsessed with my brother's cryptic message recently, but I absolutely swear it isn't about him.${prompt};
I wanted to talk to you about the recent appearance of evil spirits in the city.${prompt};
...Oops. I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I?;
Apparently, there's a woman whose behavior has been quite suspicious of late, to say the least.${prompt};
For example, she's been slipping out of her house in the dead of night. That normally wouldn't be much cause for concern, except...${prompt};
She looks like this when she walks, with a blank stare and glazed-over eyes. What's more, she speaks in tongues whenever she's afflicted!${prompt};
Her destination seems to be somewhere in the jungle, as she often tries to leave the city.${prompt};
Any questions?;
${selection-lines};
You're researching what, exactly?;
I thought you were reading some book.${prompt};
I couldn't tell what because...;
${selection-lines};
...you're not actually reading anything.${prompt};
I swear I was!;
I just needed a break, that's all...;
<Sniffle> I'm sorry.;
I know time is of the essence and this matter is of the utmost import. I won't be so careless again.${prompt};
Oh, that was a joke?;
Well, it was a rather uncouth one, if you ask me.${prompt};
Why am I researching this anyway?;
Because the woman in question is the daughter of Pollimio, who holds a high office in the Pioneers' Coalition. He presides over certain aspects of Adoulin's mercantile endeavors and is an outspoken proponent of the colonization movement.${prompt};
I was just about to pay him a visit after I collected the necessary background information here, but you've come at the perfect time.${prompt};
If possible, would you please accompany me?;
I have a hunch that this could somehow be related to what befell my brother.${prompt};
What? You've seen something exactly like this? What are the odds!?${prompt};
...Oh my. How terrible.;
Let's make haste to the battlegrounds to find this Elmric person and check on that poor girl.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Always a pleasure to have you come pay us a visit. Our fair princess is not here today, but I would be glad to assist you in any way I am able.${prompt};
Ortharsyne--the sword of the founder king, you mean? All our books on historical happenings and artifacts are located on the shelves toward the back of the room.${prompt};
I have but one request--please do not cause much of a ruckus this time.${prompt};
Take a look at which book?;
${selection-lines};
Heroes and Legends of Adoulin.;
Treasures of the Royal Family.;
His Majesty and the Golden Beast.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You carefully remove “Heroes and Legends of Adoulin” from the shelf. Its red leather cover is emblazoned with the seal of the Order of Adoulin.;
The first chapter, floridly titled “White Wings of the Swallow, Bring Glory Unto Our House!” contains a vivid description of the founder king's exploits in Ulbuka, as well as a variety of minutiae about royal retainers.${prompt};
“...And so it came to be that the Founder King--may His glory blossom eternal--advanced onto the continent with eleven of his most trusted retainers.${prompt};
“In one fell swoop He severed the heads of a hundred beasts, and the very trees parted before his noble visage, their limbs genuflecting as he passed ever further into the jungle.${prompt};
“But the innermost reaches refused to yield to even one so steadfast of will and righteous of spirit as His Majesty.${prompt};
“If He could not breach the veil, then what hope did His eleven retainers have?${prompt};
“One by one they fell to demons with teeth as long as greatswords and claws as sharp as daggers, or brambled vines whose choking grasps injected poison into the retinue's writhing flesh.${prompt};
“Only one remained resolute in the face of impending doom--the unwavering Morimar of the Order of Shneddick, whose axe cleaved foe after foe in twain in the name of our King.${prompt};
“And then the continent began to turn on them.${prompt};
“What happened to them that day was lost to the ages. Yet the Founder King surely stared into the cold gaze of death as He lay beneath the shrouded canopy.${prompt};
“As the darkness clouded His eyes, He feebly rose His right hand, presented Morimar with His blade and a tiny keepsake, and with His last breath murmured, 'Never again shall man set foot into the wilds of Ulbuka.' Morimar solemnly accepted these gifts as the Founder King bid him return to Adoulin in his stead.${prompt};
“Morimar hurried back to this city, spreading the Founder King's dying words to all. His duty fulfilled, he marched back into the wilds, never to be heard from again.”${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You carefully remove “Treasures of the Royal Family” from the shelf. Its spine has gone soft, and a musty smell wafts from its blue cover.;
Depictions of various jewels, paintings, earthenware, and more adorn the tome's faded yellow pages.${prompt};
“Ortharsyne”;
“This blade--specifically, a poniard--was wielded by the late founder king from the age of six until his untimely demise in the wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt};
“Since then, each of Adoulin's kings have kept the blade at their side, not just as a ceremonial object, but also as a solemn reminder of the founder king's dying words.${prompt};
“In more recent history, the dissolution of the monarchy means that no one man has ruling authority over the city, yet each grand chancellor has continued to uphold this most ancient of customs.${prompt};
“Owing in large part to the circumstances of the legendary poniard returning to Adoulin after the founder king's fall, rumors abound that the blade holds a latent potential within it--yet none have seen it do anything more than hang at its owner's waist.”${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You carefully remove “His Majesty and the Golden Beast” from the shelves. This black volume is covered in a thin layer of dust.;
A colorful illustration meant for a younger audience depicts a three-yalm-tall beast of unknown species rearing up on its hind legs to confront a battle-ready founder king.${prompt};
“...And the biggest monster Adoulin ever did see rose up and bared its teeth at the king.${prompt};
“How big was it? Why, it made even the biggest mountain look like the tiniest vermin nest. The founder king's head nearly fell from his shoulders straining to look up at its face!${prompt};
“Its fur sparkled in the light of the bright sun above.${prompt};
“The beast gave out a mighty roar! Graaaaaah!;
“Its claws were bigger and sharper than even the king's sword!${prompt};
“'Leave this to me!' the king bellowed as he shielded his friends. And so he fought the beast all by himself.${prompt};
“They fought for seven days and seven nights, until the beast finally apologized for making the king mad.${prompt};
“'Who are you?' the king asked.;
'My name's Terrcualn,' the beast replied.${prompt};
“'So, Terrcualn...';
'What is it?'${prompt};
“'You lost, which means you must obey me.';
'Of course, Master.'${prompt};
“And that's how the big, scary beast came to travel with the king deep into the jungle.”${prompt};
Did you find what you were searching for, ${name-player}?${prompt};
All volumes, tomes, and treatises ever published in Adoulin find their way onto our shelves. If it exists, you'll find it here.${prompt};
You wish to learn more about our princess's sword? Would that I could help you further, but if what you seek is not located in our annals, then I am unable to do so.${prompt};
Perhaps the one who knows the most about the blade would be its wielder--Princess Arciela herself.${prompt};
I had an inkling that my words would bring out the bookworm in you, ${name-player}.;
I was thinking back on our conversation and recalled an old legend told about the blade in question.${prompt};
I am pleased that I found you before you departed. Is your research complete?${prompt};
Hoho, then I have impeccable timing.${prompt};
Tell me, have your studies borne fruit?${prompt};
I am quite interested in hearing what you have learned. Then we can discuss this legend of mine.${prompt};
The Celennia Memorial Library shines once more--a veritable treasure trove of information, to be sure. And your discoveries will help put this in the proper context.${prompt};
Let me regale you with the tales I have heard, though they may differ slightly from what other sources tell.${prompt};
“In an eage whence schade dennen his land, the warants of forest shalt floc neoen the leme of the merke blade, yet only with the ore of the swallow's witeword.${prompt};
“Hence, one of the whyte fether shalt florischen the swerdes sext.”${prompt};
You seem perplexed, ${name-player}. Like most legends of old, the words themselves are quite tangled, wouldn't you agree?${prompt};
I have faith that you can puzzle it out. Think of it as a mental exercise that may aid you in your quest.${prompt};
Fare thee well, ${name-player}, as my task for the day is done--and my games of chance await.${prompt};
Handed over key item: ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} rings out across the land, somehow resonating with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and causing it to evolve.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has reclaimed its lost power, and your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} silently crumbles to dust.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} is bestowed with an incredible amount of runic energy, causing it to take on a more puissant form.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has reached the pinnacle of its evolution.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} decomposes instantly and is carried by the winds to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt};
You feel an ever-so-faint sense that a rune with ${choice: 0}[frigid/bright/transient] properties lies nearby.${prompt};
You scribbled down some information regarding ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You have obtained new information regarding your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Strange visions flood into your mind!${prompt};
Fragments of shattered memories wedge themselves into your skull.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. What do you require this day?${prompt};
It is not a book you are looking for, but rather, the conservator?${prompt};
She is likely in the back handling some of our more esoteric works. A moment, please.${prompt};
<Yawn>;
All that dust back there wreaks havoc-wavoc with my eyes!${prompt};
Permitaru me to introduce myself, I am...${prompt};
...Wait. Didn't you stop by a while back inquiring about particular tomes-womes? Is there something special you require today?${prompt};
What do you require today?;
${selection-lines};
I'm here for Roskin.;
Heroes and Legends of Adoulin.;
Are you feeling well?${prompt};
Roskin? Is that name supposed to ring-wing a bell?${prompt};
Ah, forgive my dour manner.${prompt};
My recent activities have been limited-wimited to transcribing some of our dustier tomes into more readable forms. This is all well and good, but I must admitaru I've been feeling a touch ill of late.${prompt};
What's worse is that I never manage-wanage to complete my tasks on time.${prompt};
Magic helps me complete multiple volumes at once, but I'm always playing catch-watch-up.${prompt};
Thankfully, I've been able to get sufficientaru sleep, but these allergies have me feeling down, what with all the dust and musty air in the back archives.${prompt};
It all comes with the territory-werritory, so I can't complain too much.;
Returning to the topic at hand, what can I assistaru you with?${prompt};
Aha. Yes, I believe we have that work in our closed stacks-wacks.${prompt};
Altana help me if I know how you learned of its existence-wistence...but as it is a concealed work, I can't allow you to check it out.${prompt};
But perhaps we can come to an...arrangementaru.${prompt};
Should you have your heartaru set on borrowing it, then you must answer a series of questions I'll pose to you.${prompt};
If you successfully clear all twelve questions, then I'll deem your knowledge of Adoulin's history sufficientaru enough to understand the gravitas of this work.${prompt};
Are you feeling particularly academic-wemic today?${prompt};
Attempt Oshasha's quiz?;
${selection-lines};
I'll take Ulbukan Flora for 200.;
I'm not spinning this wheel.${prompt};
Not confident, eh? Brush up a bit and come back when you're ready-weady.${prompt};
<Yawn>...;
I will lend you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} if you successfully answer ${number: 0} of my question${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]. Are you prepared?${prompt};
Then let us begin!${prompt};
Then let Adoulin Showdown commence!!!${prompt};

Splendidly done. Your knowledge of our fair city and her history is commendable, particularly for an outsider-wider.${prompt};

If only I could stop getting lost in my superior's eyes when he makes ridiculous requests of me, I wouldn't be here searching for geomancers and rune fencers.${prompt};
Holy burned books! Your outfit!;
So you do indeed walk the path of the ${choice: 0}[geomancer/rune fencer], ${name-player}.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
I swear my superior knows I'll do anything to please him. Why else would he make me wait around here looking for a ${choice: 0}[geomancer/rune fencer] to come out of the woodwork?${prompt};
Yes, someone with the same sort of trappings that you're wearing right now.${prompt};
Wait! Now that I've had time to think about it, I can feel ${choice: 0}[the telltale comforting warmth that signals a harmonious relationship with nature/a cryptic elemental ambience] emanating from your livery!;
You're a ${choice: 0}[geomancer/rune fencer], aren't you?${prompt};
Are you a ${choice: 0}[geomancer/rune fencer]?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I am.;
I'm just little old ${name-player}.${prompt};
Well, aren't you a saucy one. Here you are wearing the traditional garb of those ${choice: 0}[lifestream dippers/symbol slingers], and you make a joke at my expense.${prompt};
I knew it!;
There's no outwitting my paper-cut-giving-sharp intuition.${prompt};
You don't get to where I am by not knowing how to ${choice: 0}[spot someone who's in tune with the overarching energies of the land/perceive runic resonances].${prompt};
I also know how to pass the time, and boy, you don't want to know how much of it I had. As I was rummaging through the musty tomes on these shelves, I came across a ${choice: 0}[miniature tapestry of poems/treatise] that was ordinary by every definition...at least upon first glance.${prompt};
However, fatefully ${choice: 0}[turning it it on its side to read/deciding to take the first letter of each line and read them backwards] proved to be key in uncovering its true meaning.${prompt};
And that meaning has an extensive amount to do with ${choice: 0}[geomancers'/rune fencers'] vestments...one would assume.${prompt};
What precisely was the profound message contained within its crumbling confines, you ask?${prompt};
That's the thing! I may have an eye for people like you, but no grasp on the tenets or academics of your profession.${prompt};
That's why I was going to hand it over to an expert, but I didn't want to disappoint my lov--superior by leaving my post. As you can imagine, I was rather conflicted.${prompt};
Now that you're here, though, I can just foist it off on you.${prompt};

Well, it's time I finally got back to doing what I came here to do. To the bookshelves!;
Oh, and good luck.${prompt};
I never pegged myself for a reader before, but it's actually kind of fun! All that ink sure does a number on your faculties, though.${prompt};
Arciela, ${name-player}! What a pleasant surprise.${prompt};
I assume you are here to read more about the founder king? If so, I have some unwelcome news.${prompt};
You have already read all our tomes that discuss what took place circa the establishment of our nation.${prompt};
...I-is that so...?;
Do you have any idea what to do now, ${name-player}?${prompt};
If there are no books left to read, how are we ever going to answer that dragon's question?${prompt};
Pardon my ignorance, Arciela.;
I forgot about the existence of a certain section.${prompt};
A certain section...?${prompt};
Verily-werily!${prompt};
Allow me to educataru you on an oft-overlooked part of our institution.${prompt};
...But first, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Oshasha, and I'm the conservator-wervator of this library.${prompt};
We have a severe dearth of patrons with an interest in the continent's ancientaru history, so it took me an exceptionally long time to recall that we have closed stacks as well.${prompt};
Closed stacks...?${prompt};
Precisely.;
As of now, you've only been reading-weading the books available to the general public.${prompt};
In other words, you've not laid a finger-winger on the pages of any concealed work!${prompt};
Anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
A “concealed work”?;
What does that even mean?${prompt};
Sorry if I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Andreine here is much more eloquentaru than me, so I'll let her explain.${prompt};
Of...of course, ma'am.;
(This is a blatant abuse of your power!)${prompt};
Wow, time sure flies when you're having fun! I simply must get back to my research-wesearch so I can be ready for the next symposium. Good luck, Andreine!${prompt};
Well...concealed works are tomes that may not be removed from the premises.${prompt};
I would be more than happy to wade through the stacks for you, but I cannot take the plunge without some direction.${prompt};
Are there really that many books back there?${prompt};
Indeed there are. Though Adoulin was founded long ago, it was not long enough ago to predate the written word. The books are practically cascading from the shelves, so voluminous are they.${prompt};
Pioneers also contribute to the archives every day by returning from the jungle with field reports.${prompt};
It would not do for some of the information contained within to be seen by common citizens. Therefore, many of those reports are relegated to the stacks for safekeeping.${prompt};
In summation, it is impossible to provide you with every tome from this ever-growing mass of vellum. I will need a subject via which to select a few relevant texts.${prompt};
Well, ${name-player}, what topic do you suggest we have her look for?${prompt};
What topic should she look for?;
${selection-lines};
The founder king's retinue.;
The founder king's battle.;
The founder king's death.;
The founder king's favorite sweets.${prompt};
D-did you say “sweets”!?${prompt};
The mere mention of that word has my tongue dancing in anticipation of the delicate waltz of saccharine flavors and--${prompt};
<Gulp>...;
No, now is not the time for such frivolities. Let us focus on the task at hand.${prompt};
“The founder king's retinue,” is it? Wait but a moment and I will return with an applicable volume.${prompt};
I trust this is the sort of tome for which you were searching?${prompt};
What have we here?${prompt};
“The founder king, August Adoulin, was a charismatic personage who incited a number of valiant individuals to join his cause.${prompt};
“This feat might have proved difficult for lesser men, but for King August, it was child's play. His character was unimpeachable, and his gallantry nonpareil. Even those whom he defeated in combat would utter his praises before exhaling their final breath.${prompt};
“Employing this uncanny charisma, he was able to subjugate the ferocious beasts that prowled the Adoulin Islands, unify the warlords of the various outlying islets, and establish himself as their leader.${prompt};
“These former warlords numbered eleven strong, and they formed what would eventually be known as eleven of the Twelve Orders, excepting only the king's house.${prompt};
“With the support of his eleven vassals, he turned his focus inward to the Ulbukan mainland and trod upon its primordial plains in hopes of taming them.${prompt};
“Pressing ever further into the maze of vegetation, they stumbled upon a swath of woodland now known as Yorcia Weald, wherein they encountered a tiger that loomed larger than the most expansive manse of the day and whose pelt was a radiant gold that would catch the sun's rays just right to melt the eyes of any who dared gaze upon it for more than a few moments.${prompt};
“This massive beast claimed to be the ruler of all who inhabited the jungle, and challenged the founder king with an ear-splitting roar. 'My name is Terrcualn, and you may only proceed once I lay lifeless upon the forest floor!'${prompt};
“With that guttural proclamation, the creatures surrounding the king withdrew, leaving what they assumed would be the best pickings to their pack leader.${prompt};
“As a rejoinder, August vowed to skin the feline alive if he laid a claw on any one of the king's followers, and the two began staring each other down in a silence that finally broke half a day hence.${prompt};
“The battle raged on for seven suns, with it ending by moonlight on the seventh night.${prompt};
“Neither wildcat nor warrior could deny the other's raw power, so they stopped the duel in favor of a long-lasting friendship.${prompt};
“As a symbol of their new alliance, the tiger entrusted his son to the care of one of the king's eleven bannermen.${prompt};
“This is the first known inhabitant whom the king befriended, but it is also far from the last. August continued to push deeper into the continent's verdant abyss, where he would confront still more natives seeking to drive him from their sacred territory.”${prompt};
This is certainly a lot more descriptive than the last thing I read here.${prompt};
It indulges in a bit too much hyperbole for my taste, but it does convey the point that their battle was hard-fought.${prompt};
Even better, it also tells us the answer to Sajj'aka's question! It said the king and his feline opponent fought in Yorcia Weald, right?${prompt};
That gets me to thinking...${prompt};
Could the gold tiger that saved me possibly be related to the one in this document?${prompt};
Are they related?;
${selection-lines};
Absolutely.;
So I've heard.${prompt};
Y-you already knew, ${name-player}!?${prompt};
What? He told you himself?${prompt};
Ah, I guess you did say something earlier about being able to communicate with him.${prompt};
He possesses some arcane power by which he can speak directly to you without having to open his mouth, right?${prompt};
That does seem rather strange, but I believe it since you've already shown us something similar with the leafkin matriarch. What really piques my interest, though, is how you earned his trust enough for him to tell you anything.${prompt};
“The founder king's battle,” you say? Very well, I shall march back with an appropriate document posthaste.${prompt};
Oh, my! ${name-player}, look here!${prompt};
“The most fearsome adversaries the king and his retinue faced during the Great Expedition were the Cimmerian Adherents.${prompt};
“With the aid of the aurelian tiger, King August and his forces plunged deeper and deeper into the wildlands. However, with the fall of night came heated battle with the Cimmerian Adherents--an event that was repeated seemingly ad infinitum.${prompt};
“No matter how many victories they earned or how many foul creatures they dispatched, the night continued to bring with it an umbral assault. The abominations knew neither fatigue nor fear, and plagued the retinue to its breaking point.${prompt};
“The fiends' reign of terror did not stop with the king's party, though. The creatures were said to loathe all things that drew breath or energy from the sun. They poisoned the land, blighted the trees, and massacred every animal they laid eyes upon.${prompt};
“As the days passed, the king learned that these dark minions had also beleaguered the goldpelt and his forest for countless nights.${prompt};
“This epiphany redoubled their determination. No longer were they both fighting for themselves, but for their companions as well.${prompt};
“Then, one evenfall, a bloodbath rained down upon the Ulbukan jungle, tainting its lush vegetation a mournful shade of red.${prompt};
“The event began with an enemy ambuscade. Ring upon ring of nocturnal horrors encircled the king and his followers. The danger became more palpable with each passing second as the shadowy grunts ilmed ever closer.${prompt};
“The resplendent feline expended his remaining stamina to unleash a terrifying attack that felled all the surrounding enemies. This selfless act bought the king and his companions enough time to escape, but also cost the tiger his life.${prompt};
...How tragic. The tiger died to protect August Adoulin...${prompt};
“Incited by the display of the wildcat's bravery, his son, the king, and the monarch's eleven stalwart crusaders pressed on in the face of the nightmarish barrage.${prompt};
“The conflict lasted for so long that all involved lost count of the days spent cleaving chunks of flesh from their assailants. At last, however, the forces of the night were pushed back to the sorcerous ruins from which they first emerged.${prompt};
“It was there that the explorers were met with that which controlled the entirety of the Cimmerian Adherents.${prompt};
“This mastermind behind the invasion of Ulbuka and the destruction of its lands was--”${prompt};
Who or what exactly reigned over the Cimmerian Adherents? This is getting really good.${prompt};
Aw, no!;
Just my luck that the most important page in the entire record has been ripped out.${prompt};
But wait, haven't there been sightings of beings similar to what this text calls “dark minions” and “Cimmerian Adherents”?${prompt};
If that's the case, then why are these creatures appearing again out of nowhere?${prompt};
They should be confined to the pages of history books and lines of old wives' tales, not roaming the jungle of present-day Ulbuka.${prompt};
It says that the Cimmerian Adherents crawled up out of their subterranean den at the behest of some being. If only we knew its identity...${prompt};
“The founder king's death” it is, then. Please bear with me while I search for a script germane to it.${prompt};
I regret to inform you that, while such a text does exist in our records, I simply cannot find it anywhere in the closed stacks.${prompt};
What!? How can that be if people aren't able to check them out?${prompt};
Well, according to the log, we gave one of the ministers special permission to borrow it.${prompt};
One of the ministers?${prompt};
Yes. It says here that we lent it to Melvien de Malecroix.${prompt};
Melvien!?${prompt};
I am extremely sorry for both the interruption and my tardiness, Andreine.${prompt};
We have taken much too long to return this tome you so kindly lent us from the closed stacks.${prompt};
Why, Lady Arciela...with ${name-player} in tow.${prompt};
I did not expect to see you two here. What, may I ask, is it that you have come to research?${prompt};
Oh, perhaps we should continue this discussion after I finish what I came here to do.${prompt};
You see, Lord de Malecroix's butler informed me that a rather peculiar tome emblazoned with the Celennia Library's seal had been lying on his desk for an extended period of time.${prompt};
However, the minister himself is...indisposed at the moment.${prompt};
As luck would have it, I had business to conduct in the vicinity, so I am here in his stead.${prompt};
Thank you so much for your diligence, Estienneux, and I am sorry you had to...${prompt};
Ahhh, this is it! Arciela, ${name-player}, this is the book I was talking about!${prompt};
It is the only one in our archives that deals with the death of the founder king.${prompt};
I got the impression that Lord de Malecroix was particularly concerned with the contents of that text. I would often see his nose buried within its pages. I surmise that was the reason it had yet to be returned.${prompt};
Well, if he was so enthralled with it that he could hardly put it down...${prompt};
Let's not waste any time, ${name-player}! Skip past the table of contents and on to the real text!${prompt};
“...Not a soul bore witness to the king's demise.${prompt};
"“The king and his followers stepped into those mysterious ruins, wherein the ""Serpentine Labyrinth""--dubbed such due to the fact it contained as many branching passageways as leaves in the jungle--sprawled before them.”${prompt}";
The Serpentine Labyrinth? Does that sound like anything you've heard of before, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Have you heard of it before?;
${selection-lines};
It sounds like Ra'Kaznar.;
Not in the least.${prompt};
Is that the ancient structure embedded within the crags of Kamihr Drifts?${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I do recall a story from my youth about a certain old building buried deep underground...${prompt};
Ra'Kaznar and this “Serpentine Labyrinth” could very well be one and the same.${prompt};
I see. I guess the text is pretty vague.${prompt};
Ugh, if only I could fully remember. I swear I was told a story about some old building buried deep beneath the earth when I was a kid, but I can't recall any of the details.${prompt};
I always assumed such tales were only told to scare children or stimulate their imaginations, but maybe there is some truth to this one after all.${prompt};
Either way, let's continue reading before we jump to any conclusions.${prompt};
“The hordes of uncanny terrors that crawled aboveground to corrupt the land all did so from that very labyrinth.${prompt};
“By this time, the king's ranks had been thinned by the droves of aberrations that had already fallen to the heroes' blades. However, that did not the least to shorten his strides into this den of iniquity.${prompt};
“Each footfall they took resounded with a booming determination to prevent this caliginous menace from ever resurfacing.${prompt};
“And yet, with the exception of one subordinate, the steps of every person who made the descent with King August were silenced within that abyssal mausoleum.${prompt};
“The lone person to survive was Morimar, the king's general and tamer of beasts. He emerged from the chaos with the golden tiger's next of kin, and no one else.${prompt};
“With the founder king nowhere to be seen and most of Morimar's account lost to the slow tick of time, all we can do is conjecture about the king's fate.${prompt};
“That conjecture, sadly, can only be based upon the few curt words his general spoke of the terrible incident.${prompt};
“From them, we can conclude that King August expended his life inside the bowels of the Serpentine Labyrinth, clashing with--${prompt};
For the Goddess's sake, the rest of this tome is completely illegible!${prompt};
“The battle was a spectacle of atrocious beauty, with hacked limbs and ruptured veins decorating each and every winding corridor of the subterranean maze.${prompt};
“Explorer after explorer in the king's retinue was struck down, but not before they could drag regiments of oppressors to the grave with them.${prompt};
“King August used himself as a shield to allow Morimar time with which to return soilside. With little to no room for error and even less for respite, the monarch's chances of climbing back up from those treacherous depths were lamentably slim.${prompt};
“Morimar hurried back to Castle Adoulin, the king's cherished blade swinging from his side and a message from the sovereign on his lips: 'No more shall we colonize the hinterland.' With that, he passed the sword on to the callow prince and princess and promptly departed.”${prompt};
Ortharsyne...${prompt};
“His orders fulfilled, Morimar vanished from sight, never to be seen again.${prompt};
“Even after his disappearance, tales of his and his feline companion's efforts to preserve the forest waft above the heads of citizens throughout Adoulin's bifurcated districts to this day.”${prompt};
So...King August never did make it back aboveground...${prompt};
Then his grave in Rala Waterways is nothing but a memorial.${prompt};
Have anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
His grave in the waterways?;
Just a memorial?${prompt};
There's a sepulcher that was erected in the Rala Waterways for the founder king.${prompt};
I always assumed that his body was entombed there, but that doesn't seem to be the case...${prompt};
That is the first I have heard of this as well.${prompt};
Perhaps Chancellor Ygnas could provide some insight into this quandary?${prompt};
Maybe...${prompt};
Although I suppose your father also disappeared under peculiar circumstances. He may not have told Ygnas anything.${prompt};
...Oh, how thoughtless of me. I should not have touched upon such an obviously sensitive issue.${prompt};
Ask about her father's disappearance?;
${selection-lines};
Of course...since he brought it up!;
No, it would be boorish of me.${prompt};
Have you acuexes living in your ears!? Did you not just hear that it is a delicate subject for the princess!?${prompt};
I care not whether you are a venerated pioneer, there are some topics you simply do not broach...no matter your station.${prompt};
It's alright. I...don't mind.${prompt};
It never occurred to me that building a grave beneath the city amongst a series of canals was odd, but thinking it over...${prompt};
Why not erect a monument in one of the plazas where everyone can see it?${prompt};
Anyway, we've done our job researching.${prompt};
The Cimmerian Adherents, the Serpentine Labyrinth, the truth about the founder king's grave...${prompt};
I feel like I have more questions now than when we first came in, but this should be more than enough to appease that surly serpent.${prompt};
Let's make our way back to Mount Kamihr and find out once and for all what's ravaging the jungle!${prompt};
Oh, hello, ${name-player}!;
I've been searching and searching, but haven't yet come up with anything of interest.${prompt};
How about you?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Show her a scale.;
Ask about the Serpentine Labyrinth.;
Cheer Arciela on.${prompt};
You say this is one of his scales? I thought it would be more...physical in form. Or does it look like this because it was sealed away for so long?${prompt};
Its light is so comfortingly warm, yet the scale itself is so frail...;
Perhaps there are more left to be found.${prompt};
I've taken a good look at the documents here in the closed stacks, and we were right in thinking that the Serpentine Labyrinth and Ra'Kaznar are the same place.${prompt};
If so, then that means it existed in Ulbuka long before the founder king ever laid eyes on it.${prompt};
Then it follows that there was a civilization that came long before, one with the technology to build such an enigmatic structure.${prompt};
It goes without saying that we don't have any records from back then, so no matter how hard I try, it's impossible to find out more.${prompt};
Just who is this heinous fiend, and what does he want?${prompt};
I'm glad you came to visit me. I'll do whatever I can here. Stay safe--everyone's waiting for good news.${prompt};
Good tidings to you, ${name-player}. What knowledge do you seek in our humble archives this day?${prompt};
Oh, you wish to know if the princess has spent an inordinate amount of time combing through the pages of a particular tome?${prompt};
Just to be sure...you are referring to something other than a historical text, correct?${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Aha!${prompt};
I think I know exactly the book for you.;
Hopefully this does not take long.${prompt};
I remember seeing her hastily shove this one into a completely separate shelf once, so it must be a guilty pleasure of hers.${prompt};
Let me worry about the whole checkout process. You go on ahead to Arciela.${prompt};
Please give the princess my regards.${prompt};
Dearest ${name-player}, to what do we owe the honor today?${prompt};
Princess Arciela? She is in the closed stacks looking for information on the founder king.${prompt};
${name-player}, are the end times truly upon us?${prompt};
Life throws many trials at us, and it is how we overcome them that displays who we truly are.${prompt};
And my trials now lie in helping my brother, managing the colonization movement, and dealing with the vicious forces in the jungle.${prompt};
Just as we vanquished Hades and peace has returned to Adoulin...${prompt};
Of course, I wish to help in any way I can.${prompt};
I scoured the shelves to see what I could learn about what Balamor said about “beginning with a stone.”${prompt};
It seems that it has something to do with a place called Li'Telor, located in the Middle Lands--your homeland.${prompt};
The annals say that the statue located in Eastern Adoulin's Goddess Promenade was fashioned after a similar creation in the ruins located there.${prompt};
Maybe you can learn more about the Cloud of Darkness if you search the ruins yourself.${prompt};
But it chills me to the bone to think that August had dealings with the world Balamor once called home.${prompt};
If Balamor is a thousand years old, then how could he maintain his form for so long? There must be some connection.${prompt};
I would go with you, but there are pressing matters at the palace to which I must attend. But please come see me if you find something out.${prompt};
Perhaps that orb of yours truly is the key...${prompt};
Forgive me, I find myself somewhat preoccupied at the moment...${prompt};
Ah!;
You are justaru the pioneer I'm looking for!${prompt};
Do you have a spare momentaru?;
I am searching for a rather unique book.${prompt};
It is a tome for internal library-wibrary use only, known as the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Not much is known about the book, including its author or the year it was written.;
In fact, we don't even know the reason-weason why it was in the library in the first place.${prompt};
Furthermore, there's a rumor-wumor that says some sort of calamity will strike those who read this mysterious book.${prompt};
It's said that the book even possesses the power to summon-wummon demons, which is why I'm searching for this particular tome.${prompt};
Fortunately, we know the lastaru person to have borrowed the book.${prompt};
His name is Ghalcimus D. Adoulin--the former leader of the Order of Adoulin himself.${prompt};
That's rightaru.;
It was none other than Arciela's father...${prompt};
Roughly five years ago, Master Ghalcimus disappeared during a survey of the forestaru and his whereabouts are still unknown.${prompt};
It is unclear if his disappearance has anything to do with the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} that I'm looking-wooking for.${prompt};
If I can find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and decipher its meaning, I might be able to solve this little puzzle-wuzzle.${prompt};
And justaru as I was contemplating the matter, I received a useful tip from the Scouts' Coalition.${prompt};
They say a book resembling the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was spotted in the Velkk village-willage located in the Marjami Ravine.${prompt};
Unfortunately, it is a rather dangerous place, and the book is thoughtaru to be located near the Velkk throne.${prompt};
You see... I'm no match for the savage Velkk in my currentaru state...${prompt};
That is why I was hoping to find a pioneer that I could countaru on.${prompt};
Arciela has nothing but good things to say about you, so will you help-welp me?${prompt};
Accept Oshasha's request?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not now.${prompt};
I only wish I was strong enough to join-woin you...${prompt};
Phew... That's a relief.;
Now then, please hurry-wurry to the Marjami Ravine.${prompt};
And if you do happen-wappen to find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, you must not open it.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. You have really taken on quite the request this time!${prompt};
Did you notice?${prompt};
The conservator did not yawn even once!${prompt};
That can only mean that this is something big!;
It must be if it can keep Oshasha awake!${prompt};
I hope you are able to locate the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} that the conservator has tasked you with finding.${prompt};
However, the Velkk village in the Marjami Ravine is a place fraught with peril.${prompt};
It is also said that the book itself is quite dangerous too.;
If you do find it, you must not open it, no matter what.${prompt};
Ah, what do we have here...;
I shall go summon the conservator at once.${prompt};
Thank you so much!;
I did not expectaru you to find it so quickly!${prompt};
So this is the mysterious book-wook known as the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Who wrote this book and for what reason-weason?${prompt};
I see...;
The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is like a kind of dictionary aboutaru demons.${prompt};
What's more, you actually engaged the author in conversation...${prompt};
His name was Schultz, you say-way?;
As in Gunther Schultz II, wielder of the grimoire in the Crystal War twenty years ago?${prompt};
In that case, I have no doubtaru that we will be successful.${prompt};
Perhaps the rumors that state this book has the ability to summon-wummon demons are true after all.${prompt};
I must find a secure location-wocation so that I can read its contents in full.${prompt};
Ah! Just where do you think you are going!?${prompt};
I am going to pay a visitaru to a friend I can trust.;
He has also been eagerly waiting to read this book.${prompt};
I wonder if by “he,” she meant Valli...${prompt};
He is a master of the blade, and teaches the art of swordsmanship after being invited as a guest of the Order of Thurandaut.${prompt};
Much like the conservator, he also came across the sea from the Middle Lands.${prompt};
Speaking of the Middle Lands...;
The conservator received a letter from the Federation of Windurst the other day!${prompt};
From what I can remember, the conservator has seemed different ever since receiving it.;
I am certain that the letter was from Shantotto...${prompt};
The conservator set out to try and solve the mysteries lurking within the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}'s pages.${prompt};
I believe she went to visit Valli, who resides with the Order of Thurandaut in Western Adoulin.${prompt};
Still... I am interested to know what has caused such a sudden change in the conservator's usual lethargy.${prompt};
I have been waiting for you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Basically, the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is enchanted with many-wany complicated spells.${prompt};
So far, Valli has only been able to decipher a portion-wortion of them.${prompt};
However, once I am finished, the book should definitely give us some insight into the demons' weaknesses.${prompt};
I plan to work with Oshasha to overcome the remaining obstacles.${prompt};
Hmm... I am curious about the author of this book.${prompt};
Well, now that ${name-player} is here, please continue, Oshasha.${prompt};
Yes. I was talking aboutaru the letter I received from Professor Shantotto.;
It was in regards to the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu...${prompt};
I have been looking into just how evil this Garazu-Horeizu was.${prompt};
I learned that he was defeated by Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada, who just so happen to be your ancestors!${prompt};
That is correctaru.;
What I am about to say was taken from the memoirs that they left for me.${prompt};
According to their notes, Garazu-Horeizu was one of the greatest geniuses in Windurst's history-wistory.;
His Maelstrom Theory was revolutionary, and awed all who heard-weard it.;
It seems to have arisen from his research-wesearch into a “beast” that was to be born from a “World Eater Egg.”;
I have heard about this before.;
A beast known as the Nesnas was born from the “World Eater Egg” and was revived no matter how many times it was defeated.${prompt};
He was actually researching such a nightmarish beast!?${prompt};
Eventually, his research pointed to a connection with the mighty terrestrial avatar that appeared nightly-wightly in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};
That is when he is said to have taken advantage of the turmoil and broughtaru on the Fourth Yagudo War, which led to many casualties.${prompt};
It was all so that he could reach the deepestaru part of the Horutoto Ruins, which only the Star Sybil is supposed to have access to.${prompt};
On orders from the Star Sybil, Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada gave pursuitaru after Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt};
They engaged in a fierce battle, with neither side yielding a single step.;
It was a battle of magic, until their magical-wagical power was eventually exhausted.${prompt};
Finally, Garazu-Horeizu used up the lastaru of his magic and turned to his Maelstrom Theory, which was near completion by that point.${prompt};
Wait! Just what kind of theory are we talking about here?${prompt};
Basically, the theory posits-wosits that one can use magic indefinitely by connecting to the source of all magical power.${prompt};
Hey! That doesn't sound very fair!${prompt};
Indeed. Most people who study the use of magic-wagic don't even think about such things.${prompt};
However, if one were to know the source of their magic-wagic, it would definitely broaden their horizons.${prompt};
Garazu-Horeizu believed that this source was the terrestrial avatar itself, and tried to link-wink it to the one found in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};
And then what happened?${prompt};
Well, the theory actually turned out to be wrong and it ended in abjectaru failure.${prompt};
Rather than serving to augmentaru magical power, all of the magic contained within that area was lost, and there was nothing left for Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada to do.${prompt};
However, Medada was convinced that letting Garazu-Horeizu escape would lead to an even greater defeataru later on.${prompt};
Her desperation caused her magical ability that had been previously supressed due to a curse to burstaru forth in a mighty explosion...${prompt};
It was “forbidden magic” that was able to defeataru and even kill the mighty Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt};
Is that the magic that you used in the battle twenty years ago?${prompt};
Yes. Therefore, if Garazu-Horeizu is resurrected in the presentaru day, I will not be able to do anything about it.${prompt};
However, as a descendant of the heroes who defeated Garazu-Horeizu, I cannot simply stand by and do nothing.;
At the very least, we must try to preventaru Garazu-Horeizu's resurrection.${prompt};
So that is why I was looking-wooking into Odin and the demons that were mentioned in Professor Shantotto's letter.${prompt};
I thoughtaru that maybe they might know of some action that we could take...${prompt};
That is when I learned about the existence of the forbidden book-wook known as the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I believe you know the rest-west of the story, Lerene.${prompt};
After completing the trial, I earned the rightaru to meet with Skhoh Undhreh.${prompt};
I understand, but I'm still worried...;
I mean, we're talking about a demon here, you know?${prompt};
That is why we must decipher the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} as quickly as possible.;
We must learn the demons' weaknesses so as to keep them in check.${prompt};
I see...;
Now I understand what you mean, Valaineral.${prompt};
As such, allow me to help you decipher the book.;
I think I might be able to help.${prompt};
Thank you, Lerene. And you too, Valaineral.;
And also...${prompt};
I am grateful for your help as well, ${name-player}.;
Please take this item as a token-woken of my gratitude.${prompt};
If you plan to remain in Adoulin for a while, I hope I can ask for your help again in the future-wuture.${prompt};
Yes, when the invitation arrives, what if the meeting is to be held in that particular building-wuilding in Eastern Adoulin...${prompt};
This is for you, ${name-player}.;
It is a gift from the conservator.${prompt};
The conservator appears to be waiting for an invitation to an auction due to be held in Eastern Adoulin.${prompt};
An auction... I wonder what it is they will be bidding on.${prompt};
Greetings. How may I be of service?;
Are you looking for the conservator perchance?${prompt};
I must apologize, but after decoding the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, she said there was somewhere she urgently needed to go.${prompt};
She has yet to return.${prompt};
I believe she was headed for Leafallia.;
Although she said Valaineral was with her, I still fear for her safety.${prompt};
Greetings.;
I have received a message from the conservator.${prompt};
Apparently, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you seek is quite difficult to obtain, ${name-player}.${prompt};
It is said that one used to be able to acquire it from the pixies, but perhaps not anymore.${prompt};
Greetings.;
I have received a message from the conservator.${prompt};
While going over her family documents, she noticed something interesting about Garazu-Horeizu.${prompt};
When he was alive, he had an orb that let him use hypnosis magic.;
It seems that this orb was wrapped in secrecy.${prompt};
Furthermore, after studying this matter, the conservator was so tired that she finally let out a loud yawn again!${prompt};
I guess that means the conservator is back to her old self.;
At last, I can breathe a sigh of relief.${prompt};
;
