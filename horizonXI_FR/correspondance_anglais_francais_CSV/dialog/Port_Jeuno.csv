The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

I found ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo!${prompt};
Master, Master!;
I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};
Master! What ${choice: 7}[an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there!;
Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...${prompt};
We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!${prompt};
Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo?;
Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!${prompt};
We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo!;
If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your ${item-singular: 3[2]}, when this ${item-singular: 4[2]} just popped out!;
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Look at what I found while cleaning out the ${item-singular: 3[2]}: ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
ボタン押すと次へ進みます${prompt};
It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;
Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!${prompt};
Little did anyone suspect that this;
would prove to be only the beginning;

Moogles are so cool!${prompt};
Um, um, I think you can have up to ten plants in yourrr room.${prompt};
Any morrre and your moogle won't be able to handle it! They're rrreally busy, you know!${prompt};
And... Oh, yeah! You have to put your seeds and flowerpots in your Mog Safe beforrre you can use 'em!${prompt};
They need to be in therrre so your moogle can use his magic on 'em!${prompt};
Moogles are awesome!♪${prompt};

Good day!${prompt};Bonjour. Tous les biens sont en franchise de droits.${prompt}
Hello there.${prompt};Bonjour !${prompt}
Fresh produce from Sarutabaruta!${prompt};Salut.${prompt}
I've got goods from Kolshushu.${prompt};Produits frais de Sarutabaruta !${prompt}
Zulkheim imports are always on sale!${prompt};J'ai des marchandises de Kolshushu.${prompt}
We're globetrotting for our stamp rally! I never rode on airships before. It was so awesome!${prompt};Les importations de Zulkheim sont toujours en solde !${prompt}
You know, stamp rallies are only for kids. Grown-ups can't play, only kids can!${prompt};Nous faisons le tour du monde pour notre rallye de tampons ! Je n'avais jamais voyagé en dirigeable avant. C'était génial !${prompt}
Kids love the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and stamp rallies more than anything! And don't you forget it!${prompt};Tu sais, les rallyes de tampons sont réservés aux enfants. Les adultes ne peuvent pas jouer, seuls les enfants le peuvent !${prompt}
I rode an airship here for the first time, and I feel rotten! Ugh... I wanna go home.${prompt};Les enfants adorent les ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et les rallyes de tampons plus que tout ! Et ne l’oubliez pas !${prompt}
I used up all the barf baskets they had. How am I supposed to make it home?${prompt};J'ai pris un dirigeable pour la première fois et je me sens mal ! Beurk... Je veux rentrer chez moi.${prompt}
Wow! Jeuno's a nice town, just like the postcards! I wanna live here when I grow up.${prompt};J'ai utilisé tous les sacs à vomi qu'ils avaient. Comment suis-je censé rentrer chez moi ?${prompt}
Did you guys hear? This grown-up said ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] wanted ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}! Hahaha!${prompt};Waouh ! Jeuno est une belle ville, juste comme sur les cartes postales ! Je veux vivre ici quand je serai grand.${prompt}
Who cares? Even grown-ups want ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};Vous avez entendu ? Cet adulte a dit qu’il voulait ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} ! Hahaha !${prompt}
I took a number and stood in line, but they ran out, right before my eyes.${prompt};Qui s’en soucie ? Même les adultes veulent ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Hmm... Yeah, that kind of thing's known to happen. Well, you don't leave me much choice. I have an extra one, so I'll let you have it.${prompt};J’ai pris un numéro et je me suis mis en ligne, mais ils sont partis, juste devant mes yeux.${prompt}
Wait... You had two this whole time? Aww, you could've at least offered me one!${prompt};Hmm... Ouais, ce genre de chose arrive. Bon, tu ne me laisses pas beaucoup de choix. J'en ai un de plus, donc je te le laisse.${prompt}
But I won't give it away for nothing. Let's see... I need something from Jeuno to take home, so get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and it's yours.${prompt};Attends... Tu en avais deux tout ce temps ? Oh, tu aurais au moins pu m'en proposer un !${prompt}
Well, it's not like I have a choice! You are just going to give it to Melina, aren't you? Scoundrel!${prompt};Mais je ne le donnerai pas pour rien. Voyons voir... J’ai besoin de quelque chose de Jeuno à ramener chez moi, alors trouve-moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et il est à toi.${prompt}
Wha... How'd you guess?${prompt};Eh bien, ce n'est pas comme si j'avais le choix ! Tu vas juste le donner à Melina, n'est-ce pas ? Scélérat !${prompt}
You can't hide anything from a woman!${prompt};Quoi... Comment as-tu deviné ?${prompt}
Well, at any rate... I'll trade you my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Better get moving before I change my mind!${prompt};On ne peut rien cacher à une femme !${prompt}
I wanted it, too. If I only had that, I wouldn't have had to...${prompt};Eh bien, en tout cas... Je te donne mon ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} en échange de ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Fais vite avant que je change d’avis !${prompt}
I heard you can find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} somewhere around Castle Oztroja.${prompt};Je le voulais aussi. Si seulement j'avais ça, je n'aurais pas eu à...${prompt}
Whoa, it's a real ${item-singular: 0[2]}! Okay, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. And don't come back saying you want to return it!${prompt};J’ai entendu dire que vous pouvez trouver ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} quelque part près du château d’Oztroja.${prompt}
You're off to Delkfutt's Tower, eh? You be careful, now.${prompt};Whoa, c’est un vrai ${item-singular: 0[2]} ! Ok, voici ton ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Et ne reviens pas en disant que tu veux le retourner !${prompt}
You're off to Delkfutt's Tower, eh?${prompt};Tu pars pour la Tour de Delkfutt, hein ? Sois prudent.${prompt}
Are you going to Delkfutt's Tower?;Tu pars pour la Tour de Delkfutt, hein ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Vas-tu à la Tour de Delkfutt ?
That's right.;
No, I'm not.${prompt};C'est exact.
Oh? My mistake, then.${prompt};Non, pas maintenant.${prompt}
It's so confusing with all the portals and trap doors in there. Ain't no walk in the park, ${choice-player-gender}[sonny/kiddo]!${prompt};Ah ? Je me suis trompé alors.${prompt}
But it's smooth sailing with this here ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. I dug it up at the book fair the other day.${prompt};C'est tellement confus avec tous les portails et les trappes là-dedans. Ce n'est pas une partie de plaisir, ${choice-player-gender}[mon p'tit/vieux] !${prompt}
It's just another piece of paper to me, so... I know! I'll trade you ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for it! Yeah, I love antiquities.${prompt};Mais c’est facile avec ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} que j’ai déniché à la foire aux livres l’autre jour.${prompt}
Will you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}?;C’est juste un morceau de papier pour moi, alors... Je sais ! Je te l’échange contre ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ! Ouais, j’adore les antiquités.${prompt}
${selection-lines};M'apporteras-tu ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ?
I'll try.;
Not now.${prompt};Je vais essayer.
Super! Hurry back with ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}! And be careful!${prompt};Pas maintenant.${prompt}
Oh yeah? Well, it's your loss, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/sister].${prompt};Super ! Reviens vite avec ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ! Et fais attention !${prompt}
Look, just bring me ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. And be careful, too.${prompt};Ah ouais ? Eh bien, tant pis pour toi, ${choice-player-gender}[pote/p'tite] !${prompt}
Tread carefully, and don't forget to check the map!${prompt};Écoute, apporte-moi juste ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. Et fais attention, aussi.${prompt}
Well, this is just super! Alrighty, here's the goods.${prompt};Marche prudemment et n'oublie pas de consulter la carte !${prompt}
Oh, you've already got ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Then take this as thanks for appeasing the collector in me.${prompt};Eh bien, c'est juste super ! Bon, voilà les marchandises.${prompt}
This underground tunnel leads to the island of Qufim. Everyone is advised to stay out. But of course you adventurers never listen.${prompt};Oh, tu as déjà ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ? Alors prends ça en remerciement d’avoir satisfait le collectionneur en moi.${prompt}
This flight is bound for the frontiers. This route has been indefinitely postponed due to safety concerns.${prompt};Ce tunnel souterrain mène à l'île de Qufim. Il est conseillé à tout le monde de rester à l'écart. Mais bien sûr, vous, les aventuriers, n'écoutez jamais.${prompt}
We apologize for the inconvenience. Expect further announcements once the route is declared safe.${prompt};Ce vol est à destination des frontières. Cette route a été reportée indéfiniment en raison de problèmes de sécurité.${prompt}
It seems the flight to the frontier is out of service.${prompt};Nous nous excusons pour la gêne occasionnée. Attendez-vous à de nouvelles annonces une fois que la route sera déclarée sûre.${prompt}

With the airships connecting Jeuno with the three nations, the flow of goods has become much more consistent. Nowadays, everything comes through Jeuno!${prompt};Le vol à destination de ${choice: 3}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Kazham] ${choice: 2}[arrive/part].${prompt}
Of course, Jeuno is situated smack-dab in the middle of the three, so this town was destined to grow and prosper.${prompt};Avec les dirigeables reliant Jeuno aux trois nations, le flux de marchandises est devenu beaucoup plus régulier. De nos jours, tout passe par Jeuno !${prompt}
I think the airships are a subtle form of pressure on the other three nations. That way, Jeuno can maintain the current balance of power.${prompt};Bien sûr, Jeuno est située en plein milieu des trois, donc cette ville était destinée à croître et prospérer.${prompt}
Nobody would want to upset the masters of such advanced technology, would they? Nope, can't blame Jeuno for keeping the secrets of airship-building to itself.${prompt};Je pense que les dirigeables sont une forme subtile de pression sur les trois autres nations. Ainsi, Jeuno peut maintenir l’équilibre actuel du pouvoir.${prompt}
This leads to departures. You'll need ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 0} gil to board.${prompt};Personne ne voudrait contrarier les maîtres d'une technologie aussi avancée, n’est-ce pas ? Non, on ne peut pas reprocher à Jeuno de garder les secrets de la construction des dirigeables pour elle-même.${prompt}
This is the departures exit. You can't go out this way. Try the next door, please.${prompt};Cela mène aux départs. Vous aurez besoin de ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} et de ${number: 0} gils pour monter à bord.${prompt}
This leads to departures. You'll need ${number: 7} gil to board a flight.${prompt};C'est la sortie des départs. Vous ne pouvez pas sortir par là. Essayez la porte suivante, s’il vous plaît.${prompt}
Pay ${number: 7} gil and head through?;Cela mène aux départs. Vous aurez besoin de ${number: 7} gils pour monter à bord d’un vol.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Paie ${number: 7} gils et passe ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
This is the arrivals exit. The entrance to departures is next door.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Once you go through customs, you'll have to pay to come back on board. Is that all right?${prompt};C'est la sortie des arrivées. L'entrée des départs est à côté.${prompt}
Proceed to the air travel agency?;Une fois que vous aurez passé la douane, vous devrez payer pour remonter à bord. Cela vous convient-il ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Aller à l'agence de voyage aérien ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
Have a safe flight!${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Enjoy your stay in Jeuno!${prompt};Bon vol !${prompt}
I can't believe those boats without wings can fly. I'll never ride on such a thing, so I walk everywhere.${prompt};Profitez bien de votre séjour à Jeuno !${prompt}
I'm sure they're a fine way to get around, but the whole concept seems fake to me.${prompt};Je n'arrive pas à croire que ces bateaux sans ailes puissent voler. Je ne monterai jamais là-dedans, alors je marche partout.${prompt}
I lost my ticket, and now I can't get on board. It takes so long to get a new one! I hope you never have to go through this.${prompt};Je suis sûr que c'est un bon moyen de se déplacer, mais tout ce concept me semble faux.${prompt}
Would you care to see a map of Jeuno?${prompt};J'ai perdu mon billet, et maintenant je ne peux pas monter à bord. Ça prend tellement de temps pour en obtenir un nouveau ! J'espère que vous n'aurez jamais à vivre ça.${prompt}
What do you say?;Voulez-vous voir une carte de Jeuno ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que dites-vous ?

Conquests.;

Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};

Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.${prompt};
Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of ${number: 5} members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.${prompt};

One of your party members is below level ${number: 6}. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.${prompt};

I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.${prompt};

You received ${number: 1} conquest points!${prompt};
When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.${prompt};
I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties.;

Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.${prompt};
We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.${prompt};
Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt};
You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt};
Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt};
Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt};
Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt};
Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt};
Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt};
Your inventory is full. You could not accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};

${number: 1}${prompt};
This flight is full.${prompt};
I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.${prompt};
You're ${name-player}, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.${prompt};
The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.${prompt};
According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.${prompt};
After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.${prompt};
Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.${prompt};
One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.${prompt};
I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!${prompt};
I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!${prompt};
Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.${prompt};
You are ${name-player}, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.${prompt};
The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.${prompt};
I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.${prompt};
I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.${prompt};
And one other thing.${prompt};
One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.${prompt};
The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a “kabuto.” Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.${prompt};
You're finally here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief.;
I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.${prompt};
To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.${prompt};
This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.${prompt};
I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...${prompt};
You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.${prompt};
I-it's you...${prompt};
We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.${prompt};
Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.${prompt};
Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...${prompt};
.........${prompt};
He has lost consciousness.${wait-animation: 2};
The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...${prompt};
Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...${prompt};
Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...${prompt};
Now there are none who can stand in my way!${prompt};
What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...${prompt};
You did it!${prompt};
The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.${prompt};
Our ancestors' ${item-singular: 0[2]} has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit's demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.${prompt};
Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away.;
Until we meet again, ${name-player}!${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has been badly damaged...;
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 3[2]} you carry has lost its effectiveness. You may dispose of it now.${prompt};
You've cleared Samurai AF 2!${prompt};
You don't have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};

The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};

My daddy was one. Until he got sick and had to leave us...${prompt};
Oh...${prompt};
After Daddy was gone, someone came and stole the mirror.${prompt};
I was so scared...${prompt};
But now I've come to this country with my mother to get the mirror back.${prompt};
Do you know anything about the mirror, Miss Luto?;
Please tell me if you do...!${prompt};
I...I have to get it back. My daddy spent his life protecting it...!${prompt};
I know, kiddo.;
Just calm down and I'll tell you what I can.${prompt};
I have the mirror that you're searching for.${prompt};
What?${prompt};
But the mirror's been broken...${prompt};
No! It can't be...!${prompt};
We've been looking for a way to fix it.;
And our search has led us to you, the daughter of one of the guardians.${prompt};
To repair the mirror, we need to learn a certain charm.;
You wouldn't happen to know anything like that, would you?${prompt};
A charm...?;
Is that like a prayer?${prompt};
Something that only a guardian would know.${prompt};
I think I do.;
My daddy taught me a prayer with some really hard words.;
But I can say them all!${prompt};
Rrreally! That's wonderful!;
Maybe there is hope for the mirror yet.${prompt};
I'll be happy just to see this trrreasure back in one piece.${prompt};
As soon as we fix your mirror, we'll give it back to you, okay?${prompt};
Okay!${prompt};
Until then, I think you should stay here in Jeuno.;
Better yet, rrright by my side!${prompt};
I don't want anything happening to you.${prompt};
It looks like I'll be needing your help again.;
All that's left is to find some of the metal used in creating the mirror.${prompt};
I'll keep porrring through “Looking Glass Legends” and see what I can find.${prompt};
You'll be the first to know if I learn anything useful.${prompt};
Phew!;
Keeping up a facade is hard work.;
I was almost feeling sorry for that little girl.${prompt};
Besides that unusual metal, I have everything I need for repairing the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.${prompt};
I'll have that mirror in one piece if it's the last thing I do!${prompt};
I wonder who this author of “Looking Glass Legends” could be.${prompt};
Anyone who can gather this sort of information alone is not to be underestimated...${prompt};
Wait a moment...;
You are an adventurer, are you not? I hear your sort does all kinds of things--fighting with monsters, cooking, and collecting all sorts of little knickknacks...${prompt};
Oh, I am truly sorry if I have offended you. I am from a land far to the east of here, and tales of adventurers are quite popular in my hometown.${prompt};
Anyway, you adventurers are quite the rowdy lot, always playing outside and showing up looking as if you had wallowed in mud, correct?${prompt};
Are you really so dirty?;
${selection-lines};
Give me some mud to wallow in!;
No! My equipment glistens!${prompt};
My goodness, it is true!;
In that case, you must need powerful detergent to remove your stains, and I happen to have exactly what you need! This solution was developed by the most skilled alchemists in the entire Near East. Surely a must-have for any adventurer!${prompt};
Now for the all-time low price of 50000 gil!${prompt};
Buy the detergent for 50000 gil?;Now for the all-time low price of ${number: 14} gil!${prompt}
${selection-lines};Buy the detergent for ${number: 14} gil?
Yes.;
No. Being dirty is fun!${prompt};
Well then, here you are! I will only give you enough for one cleaning, though. Using any more than that would erode cermet!${prompt};
Oh? I am afraid you do not have enough gil.${prompt};
Oh my, such confidence.;
Could it be because you possess that remarkable armor I have heard about in rumors...artifact armor, I believe it is called?${prompt};
I am not finished, so wait! Undoubtedly your artifact armor was once something to take pride in, but at present it is surely quite battered from your adventuring, not to mention that it has simply become old and could use a boost...correct?${prompt};
If I were you, my dear friend, I would take your precious artifact armor and restore it! Rejuvenate it! Give it new life! Does that not sound like the proper course of action?${prompt};
I know exactly what you need. You absolutely must bring the necessary ingredients, and I will send them with your artifact armor to the craftsmen of the Near East for a miniscule fee in ${item-plural: 16[2]}!${prompt};
There, I have contracts with the most skilled artisans, who will make your artifact armor shine like never before.${prompt};
Of course, it shall be difficult for you to give up your beloved artifact armor, if but for a short while. However, please inform me if you work up the courage, and I will tell you the ingredients I require.${prompt};

Why ${item-plural: 16[2]}, you ask? To be quite frank, I do not know much about them beyond the fact that they were used as currency by the turtle-like beastmen of this continent, but they happen to be quite valuable among Near Eastern collectors.${prompt};

I apologize, but I cannot take any more ${item-plural: 16[2]} from you.${prompt};
You have collected the proper materials, but unfortunately you lack the required amount of ${item-plural: 16[2]} for payment.${prompt};
You need ${number: 7} ${item-given-plurality: 7[2], 16[2]}, but you have only given me ${number: 6} thus far. That would not even pay the cost of postage to the Near East and back!${prompt};
Your artifact armor will be handled with utmost care. Now if you please, I will send it with the materials you have collected to the craftsmen of the Near East. But fear not, as it shall be worth the wait.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 1[2]} is still undergoing restoration in the Near East. Please wait a while longer.${prompt};
I apologize for the wait. The restored ${item-singular: 1[2]} just arrived from the Near East. May it be of help in your adventures.${prompt};
I must apologize. I am currently out of stock, so would you please come back a bit later?${prompt};
The next shipment is not scheduled to come in until ${vanatime: 4} (${earthtime: 4} Earth time).${prompt};
Hm?;
It seems that you already possess some ${keyitem-singular: 15[2]}... You must be very skilled in the ways of commerce. I can see it in your eyes.${prompt};
I came from the Near East to peddle my wares. I heard that there are simply hordes of gullib--err, that is, I have heard of the great adventurers that roam this land, and wish to be of service to them. If you happen to know of any seasoned adventurers, I ask that you bring them to me. Be sure to tell them of my fabulous goods!${prompt};
What's this? You wish for me to return some of your ${item-plural: 16[2]}?;
You surprise me, ${name-player}. I would not have taken you for a collector, but I suppose one should never judge a coin by its coinpurse.${prompt};
I currently have ${number: 7} of your ${item-plural: 16[2]}.;
How many do you wish to retrieve?${prompt};
Very well. ${number: 0} it is, then.${prompt};
I cannot return more than the ${number: 7} you have entrusted to me.;
I am a collector, not a treasury--I am not in the business of offering loans.${prompt};
As you wish.${prompt};
Oho! You have quite the discerning eye, friend.;
I'd be happy to take that ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} off your hands.${prompt};
Whatever luster this piece once had has long since faded away.;
I fear it would be of little value to me.${prompt};
What a positively pristine specimen! This should prove a popular collector's item across the Near East.;
I can give you ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} for it. What do you say?${prompt};
...And the deal is done!;
Always a pleasure to do business with you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}? Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
No, give me more time.;
Yes, that's what I want.${prompt};
It simply cannot be! You say you possess the legendary relic armor?${prompt};
They say that relic armor was specially created by the best craftsmen in Vana'diel during the Great War in order to resist the Kindred, and was available only to the very best of the elite forces!${prompt};
That such powerful equipment could actually exist is unthinkable!${prompt};
However, while relic armor is incredibly powerful, yours is rather worn, and perhaps even cursed!${prompt};
If you hand your precious relic armor over to me, I could do all kinds of fantastic research on...${prompt};
Ahem, that is, I could make it shine like new! So how about it? It's worth a try, is it not?${prompt};
Here is what you must do: First, you must bring me an item that is the same as your relic armor, even if it is so ragged that it can no longer be worn.${prompt};
I also require ancient currency from the main three Western nations as a fee.${prompt};
Why ancient currency?;
Because in the Near East we find traditional gil more trustworthy than modern fluff!${prompt};
I can ship your relic armor off to the guilds of the Near East, and when you see it next, it will be in mint condition!${prompt};
However, I realize that you must be mentally prepared if you are to hand your treasure over to be sent across the seas. Just let me know when you are ready, and I will inform you of the items necessary for restoration.${prompt};

Thank you for your patronage. I will send your relic armor to the craftsmen of the Near East, but it may take some time before it is returned. I ask for your understanding in this matter.${prompt};
Wait a moment...;
You are an adventurer, are you not? I hear your sort does all kinds of things--fighting with monsters, cooking, and collecting all sorts of little knickknacks...${prompt};
Oh, I am truly sorry if I have offended you. I am from a land far to the east of here, and tales of adventurers are quite popular in my hometown.${prompt};

I've heard that the technology of Aht Urhgan has developed along quite different lines than that of Bastok.${prompt};
Of course, airship technology has been our greatest achievement, but I've heard outlandish rumors about the Near East. One even says that they've created living creatures with their alchemy skills! Tales like that run chills down my spine.${prompt};

Read which chapter?;
${selection-lines};
1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”;
2. “Rules of the Roll.”;
3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt};
Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt};
Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt};
In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt};
If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt};
Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt};
Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt};
If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt};
Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt};
Looking for someone? Maybe I can help.${prompt};

Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt};
It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.;
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.;
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};

Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt};
...Alas.;
It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt};
Hmm, what's this?;
It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt};

Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!;
What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt};
Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!;
Ain't synergy grand?${prompt};
Wait! No, don't tell me.;
You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt};
Learn about synergy?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
Teach me!;
Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.;
Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt};
I thought you'd never ask!;
Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt};
Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt};
What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
Press confirm to proceed.${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
O...i...!;
C'mon now, open yer eyes!;
Ye all right, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?;Allez, ouvre les yeux !
Gave me a right fright, crumplin' to the ground without warnin' as ye did.${prompt};Ça va, ${choice-player-gender}[camarade/fille] ?
Eh? A pink flash of light in the sky, ye say?${prompt};Tu m'as fait une sacrée peur en t'effondrant par terre sans prévenir.${prompt}
Took a knock on the ol' noggin when ye fell, most like.;Hein ? Une lumière rose dans le ciel, dis-tu ?${prompt}
No one from 'round here's seen anythin' of the sort.${prompt};Tu t'es probablement cogné la tête en tombant.
What're ye called, if I might ask?${prompt};Personne d'ici n'a vu quelque chose de ce genre.${prompt}
${name-player}, eh? Me name's Joachim, an' the fact ye remember yer own means yer wits're intact, I'd say.${prompt};Comment t'appelles-tu, si je puis demander ?${prompt}
${name-player}.${prompt};${name-player}, hein ? Moi c'est Joachim, et le fait que tu te souviennes de ton nom signifie que tu n'as pas perdu tes esprits, je dirais.${prompt}
What ye witnessed jus' now was no trick of the mind, but as real a thing as the folk in this bustlin' port.${prompt};
Ye saw what ye did 'cause ye've got “potential.” Aye, that ye do.;Ce que tu as vu tout à l'heure n'était pas un tour de l'esprit, mais aussi réel que les gens dans ce port animé.${prompt}
But whether this potential'll serve ye good or ill's not somethin' I can say.${prompt};Tu as vu ce que tu as vu parce que tu as du “potentiel”. Oui, c'est vrai.
Remember what I jus' told ye, though.;Mais si ce potentiel te sera utile ou néfaste, je ne peux pas le dire.${prompt}
An' if ye ever start wantin' answers, come an' seek me out.${prompt};Souviens-toi de ce que je viens de te dire.
Sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], but would ye mind leavin' me in peace?${prompt};Et si jamais tu commences à chercher des réponses, viens me voir.${prompt}
CHECK${prompt};Désolé, ${choice-player-gender}[camarade/fille], mais pourrais-tu me laisser en paix ?${prompt}
ERROR${prompt};VÉRIFIER${prompt}
${number: 0}${prompt};ERREUR${prompt}
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}.;
I knew ye'd come seekin' answers sooner or later.${prompt};Eh bien, si ce n'est pas ${name-player}.
So ye be wantin' t' know 'bout the strange flash of light ye saw...${prompt};Je savais que tu viendrais chercher des réponses tôt ou tard.${prompt}
I'm not one fer beatin' 'round the bush, so I'll say it straight. What ye witnessed was a phenomenon called “noise”--the irregular brushin' of one dimension against another. Ordinary folk don't see such things, mind ye. So I s'pose that makes ye extra-ordinary.${prompt};Alors, tu veux savoir à propos de l'étrange lumière que tu as vue...${prompt}
Me theory's that ye've got a natural attunement t' the phasic alignment of our dimensions. That be the potential I spoke of when I found ye sprawled on the ground.${prompt};Je ne suis pas du genre à tourner autour du pot, alors je vais être direct. Ce que tu as vu est un phénomène appelé “bruit”--le frottement irrégulier d'une dimension contre une autre. Les gens ordinaires ne voient pas ce genre de choses, tu sais. Donc je suppose que ça te rend extraordinaire.${prompt}
...${prompt};Ma théorie est que tu as une attunement naturelle à l'alignement phasique de nos dimensions. C'est le potentiel dont je parlais quand je t'ai trouvé étendu par terre.${prompt}
Ye look a bit out o' sorts, an' I don't blame ye. The truth can be a bitter draught t' swallow, I know.${prompt};
I'd love nothin' more than to say this is jus' some hearth tale, I would. We'd all be happier that way, t' be sure. But what's an adventurer if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] turns ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] back t' reality?${prompt};Tu as l'air un peu déconcerté, et je ne te blâme pas. La vérité peut être un breuvage amer à avaler, je le sais.${prompt}
Now, this isn't t' say that I take ye fer a faithless type, but I've got a feelin' that simple words won't do. Some things a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]'s jus' got t' see with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own two eyes.${prompt};J'aimerais rien de plus que de dire que ce n'est qu'un conte de foyer, je le ferais. Nous serions tous plus heureux ainsi, c'est sûr. Mais qu'est-ce qu'un aventurier si ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] tourne le dos à la réalité ?${prompt}
So I want ye to have this.${prompt};Maintenant, ça ne veut pas dire que je te prends pour quelqu'un sans foi, mais j'ai l'impression que de simples mots ne suffiront pas. Certaines choses, un ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] doit les voir de ses propres yeux.${prompt}
It's ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Alors je veux que tu aies ceci.${prompt}
If ye've truly got the potential I marked ye fer, that stone there'll guide ye on yer way.;C’est ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Take it with ye an' pay a visit t' one of them cavernous maws.${prompt};Si tu as vraiment le potentiel que j'ai remarqué en toi, cette pierre là te guidera sur ton chemin.
Ye know of those ghastly things, aye?${prompt};Prends-la avec toi et rends visite à l'une de ces gueules béantes.${prompt}
Mind ye, the ones that're frozen like stiffs won't serve.${prompt};Tu connais ces choses sinistres, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...${prompt};Attention, celles qui sont figées comme des cadavres ne serviront à rien.${prompt}
Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...${prompt};La Plateau de La Thaïne, les Hautes Terres de Konschtat, le Canyon de Tahrongi...${prompt}
Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...${prompt};La Forêt de Jugner, les Dunes de Valkurm, la Péninsule de Buburimu...${prompt}
There be maws in these areas what've been freed from their inanimate state.;Xarcabard, le Nord de Gustaberg, le Sud de Gustaberg...${prompt}
What be the reason fer this, though, yer coin's as good as mine.${prompt};Il y a des gueules dans ces zones qui ont été libérées de leur état inanimé.
Now that ye know where the answer awaits, the rest is in yer hands.${prompt};Mais la raison de cela, c'est aussi mystérieux que le reste.${prompt}
But I leave ye with a word of warnin'.;Maintenant que tu sais où trouver la réponse, le reste est entre tes mains.${prompt}
Seek the truth with frivolous intent, and it'll cost ye yer life.${prompt};Mais je te laisse avec un avertissement.
That's no idle threat, but simply the way it is.${prompt};Cherche la vérité avec une intention frivole, et cela te coûtera la vie.${prompt}
Never ye be forgettin' my words.${prompt};Ce n'est pas une menace en l'air, mais simplement la façon dont les choses sont.${prompt}
Well met, ${name-player}. Anythin' I can help ye with?${prompt};N'oublie jamais mes paroles.${prompt}
What do you want to know?;Bienvenue, ${name-player}. Puis-je t'aider avec quelque chose ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que souhaitez-vous savoir ?
I want ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
About the cavernous maws.;Je veux ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
Nothing.${prompt};À propos des mâchoires cavernicoles.
Nothin' I can do? I'll be right here if ye change yer mind.${prompt};Rien.${prompt}
The maws tickle yer fancy, eh?${prompt};Rien que je puisse faire ? Je serai là si jamais tu changes d'avis.${prompt}
These ${choice: 1}[zero/three/six/nine] areas're where ye'll find the thawed maws.${prompt};Les gueules t'intéressent, hein ?${prompt}
All in good time, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]. Whether yer potential's equal the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}'s worth remains t' be seen. One should be more than enough fer the nonce.${prompt};Ces ${choice: 1}[zéro/trois/six/neuf] zones sont là où tu trouveras les gueules dégelées.${prompt}
Me apologies, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].${prompt};Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre, ${choice-player-gender}[camarade/compagne]. Si ton potentiel équivaut à la valeur du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, reste à voir. Un devrait suffire pour l’instant.${prompt}
I could've jus' told ye everythin', but there's naught quite like havin' cold, hard reality shoved in yer face.${prompt};Mes excuses, ${choice-player-gender}[camarade/compagne].${prompt}
Ye've got a quick head restin' on yer shoulders, so no doubt ye've already pieced it together.;J'aurais pu simplement tout te dire, mais rien ne vaut une bonne dose de réalité bien crue.${prompt}
I'm not of this world, but a visitor come from the plane ye've jus' paid visit to. “Abyssea,” we call it.${prompt};Tu as une tête bien faite sur les épaules, donc tu as sûrement déjà tout compris.
Havin' now seen it with yer own two eyes, it's needless t' tell ye the shoddy state Abyssea's in.;"Je ne suis pas de ce monde, mais un visiteur venu du plan que tu viens de visiter. Nous l'appelons ""Abyssea"".${prompt}"
Without so much as a howl of warnin', we were overrun by fell creatures that'd put nightmares t' shame. Whole nations were reduced t' piles of rubble.${prompt};
The once-blue sky turned a blood-red, an' the saviors we'd prayed fer were all felled, one after the other.;
Those that weren't taken in the first wave of destruction were left t' live in despair, cowerin' in fear if so much as a shadow flickered past.${prompt};
I know full well I've no right to ask this of ye, but I must.;
Please help us. We've got no hope left save what we can find in brave souls such as ye.${prompt};
I beg ye, be the glimmer of hope me folk an' I so badly need...${prompt};
Be their glimmer of hope?;
${selection-lines};
You betcha!;
Uhrrrm...all right.${prompt};
Y-ye've no idea what this means to us, ${name-player}! We're forever in yer debt.${prompt};
To help ye help us, it'll be me pleasure t' share all I know.${prompt};
To recap what I've already told ye, the cavernous maws are portals to Abyssea.;
But the door won't open unless ye've got one of them ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That's not their only purpose, mind ye.${prompt};
Besides bein' keys, they also serve as anchors what secure yer essence t' foreign dimensions.;
In simpler terms, they allow you t' stay within Abyssea, though not indefinitely.${prompt};
One's good fer a ${number: 1}-minute stay (Earth time), and ${number: 2} of them is the most ye can hold at once.;
Do the math, and ye'll get the longest stretch of time folk of yer world can stay in Abyssea.${prompt};
Now, what I'm about t' tell ye is deathly crucial, so take it t' heart.;
Stay anchored in another dimension overlong, an' what was temporary will become permanent. In other words, ye risk losin' fer good the means t' return home.${prompt};
A bunch of me mates an' I are livin', walkin' proof of such a tragedy.${prompt};
But ye can rest assured, fer ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} these days are worked with a safety measure.;
At the first sign of trouble it'll catapult ye back home safe an' sound.${prompt};
Well, that's jus' about the beef of it. Come see me whenever ye want ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, aye?;
I might not always have one on hand, though, as it takes a bloody long time--twenty hours, t 'be precise (Earth time)--t' infuse one with energy. Any less an' they're about as useful as skippin' stones.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Good t' lay eyes, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].${prompt};
What would like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
I want ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Learn about ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.;
Current ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} stock.;
Cavernous maw locations.;
Teleporting to a cavernous maw.;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
Nothin' ye need?;
Ye jus' let Joachim here know if ever ye need more ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, aye?${prompt};
The maws tickle yer fancy, eh?${prompt};
Make sure ye've got enough ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} b'fore ye go divin' into maws.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} aren't jus' keys t' open the portal t' Abyssea.${prompt};
They also serve as anchors what secure yer essence t' foreign dimensions.${prompt};
In other words, they allow you t' stay within Abyssea, though not indefinitely.${prompt};
Ye be wantin' another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
Let me jus' quickly check what I've got in store.${prompt};
Eh? Looks like ye've already got yerself ${number: 2} of them.;
Sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], but no sane ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] ought have more, lest ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] risk gettin' ${choice-player-gender}[hisself/herself] stranded in Abyssea.${prompt};
Ah, sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], but I've got nothin' fully charged right now.;
Check back in a wee while, would ye?${prompt};
Here ye go, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]. That should be enough fer now.${prompt};
I see ye've hooked yerself up with some cruor. In case ye didn't already know, these red granules first appeared when the cataclysm befell Abyssea.${prompt};
We've yet t' uncover the mystery of this strange mineral--what the hell it is, fer instance--but thanks t' its gem-like appearance, folk quickly adopted it as currency in Abyssea. ${prompt};
That's not the only reason fer its meteoric rise t' prominence, mind ye. Cruor's a highly condensed source of energy, ye see, an' has already found application in various facets of post-apocalyptic life.${prompt};
Martellos, veridical confluxes...all these things depend on cruor fer power. Can't imagine gil bein' half as useful, can ye?${prompt};
But that ain't all. By unleashin' the power of cruor, you can now instantaneously travel from here t' cavernous maws what serve as gateways t' Abyssea. Ye jus' need t' have been there once b'fore.${prompt};
Is there nothin' these little red buggers can't do? I, fer one, am beginnin' t' think not.${prompt};
If ye've a mind to teleport somewhere, jus' speak with Horst beside me here. He'll take good care of ye.${prompt};
It'll take me ${number: 4} more ${choice-plurality: 4}[minute/minutes] t' fully charge another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} (Earth time).${prompt};
Ye want t' know how many ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} ye've got to yer name?;
That'd be ${number: 1}, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].${prompt};
Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
${name-player}. I've been told ye met some mates of mine.${prompt};
Ye ought t' know now how starved of hope me folk are, livin' each day not knowin' if it'd be the last.${prompt};
So far we've managed t' stay in the fight, puttin' up protective wards an' pitchin' warmachines into the fray, but they're temporary measures at best.${prompt};
The Abyssean hordes continue to grow, an' not a day goes by without us losin' ground t' them.${prompt};
Fer too long we've been forced onto our back foot. If we're t' have any hope of survival, we need t' go on the offensive.${prompt};
But fer this we need yer aid.${prompt};
I beg ye, ${name-player}! Help us turn the tide of battle in our favor!${prompt};
${name-player}! I couldn't believe me ears when first I heard the news!${prompt};
Yer exploits against the Abyssean hordes've allowed us t' escape the rut we're in.;
Fer once I find meself thankin' the gods fer strandin' me in this world.${prompt};
With yer help, there's hope yet fer Abyssea.;
Why, there're even some as say it might be restored to its former glory!${prompt};
I meself am not one fer countin' eggs afore they're hatched, but one thing's fer certain:${prompt};
The seed of hope has sprouted!${prompt};
A seedling it is still, but lit with determination and watered with perseverance, into a great, towerin' oak it'll surely grow!${prompt};
A long road stretches far ahead of us...${prompt};
But with yer help, ${name-player}, we'll follow it one step at a time...'til the day we reach its end!${prompt};
Ah, there ye are, ${name-player}. I was wonderin' when next ye'd turn up.${prompt};
There be somethin' I need t' ask of ye. Well, t' be precise, there be someone I'd like ye t' meet.${prompt};
Due t' reasons beyond our control, the man can't be here. So instead he'll be waitin' for ye at the stone circle in the La Theine Plateau.;
I trust a veteran adventurer such as yerself knows how t' navigate ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] there.${prompt};
Truly sorry fer this sudden request, but circumstances won't allow fer a meetin' t' take place here.;
I'd explain the reason why, except I'm sworn t' silence on this.${prompt};
Go meet the mystery man?;
${selection-lines};
Oooh, I love mysteries!;
Sounds a little shady...${prompt};
I beg fer yer understandin', ${name-player}.;
Ye know I'd tell ye all if I could, but this is jus' the way it's gotta be.${prompt};
I'm in yer debt yet again, ${name-player}.;
Now, as I said, ye'll meet yer man at the stone circle in La Theine. Thing is, due t' the stones' properties, he can't be there fer long stretches of time.${prompt};
Only from dusk till dawn can he cross over t' this world. Be keepin' that in mind.${prompt};
I don't blame ye if ye're feelin' reserved about meetin' this mystery man, but I assure ye, he's a real dinkum bloke.${prompt};
Jus' take yerself over t' the rendezvous point, an' he'll seek ye out. It's simple as meat pie.${prompt};
Go well, ${name-player}. Be seein' ye again real soon.${prompt};
Welcome back, ${name-player}.;
It seems the meetin' went without incident.${prompt};
I trust ye understand now why the man couldn't come t' Jeuno.${prompt};
Bein' an underworld figure of sorts, it wouldn't do if he were seen paradin' himself hereabouts.${prompt};
Doubtless he's already bent yer ears 'bout havin' been a pirate back in the day, runnin' his operations out of Elshimo.${prompt};
Considerin' how well-traveled an adventurer ye are, I reckon ye already knew the man.${prompt};
But I won't probe ye on that subject. Some things are best left untouched, t' be sure.${prompt};
I find meself sayin' this often of late, but yer aid has allowed hope t' sprout among the survivors.;
If ye were t' ask me if mankind's made any real progress, though, the answer would be a resoundin' “no.”${prompt};
The survivors're more organized than afore, true, but our fundamental plight be as grim as ever.;
The Abyssean hordes attack, an' we beat them back as best we can. An' when we're not busy fendin' off monsters, we're scrapin' up what livin' we can, foragin' fer food what can still be had.${prompt};
None of this has changed, ${name-player}, an' I suspect that be why ye were called out t' La Theine.;
Rumors of yer feats aren't like t' escape the notice of key resistance folk fer long. Soon or late, they'd look ye up, hopin' t' recruit yer aid in gettin' us out of this rut.${prompt};
Hit the nail fair on the head, did I?;
I'm not the only one who sees great things in ye, ${name-player}, an' fer good reason.${prompt};
Me comrades an' I crossed over t' this world, desperately searchin' fer a way t' save our home.${prompt};
An' in the midst o' our despair, we found our ray of hope in strong, compassionate folk such as yerself.${prompt};
Uncoverin' the truth an' restorin' Abyssea t' its erstwhile state--these things've proven t' be far beyond the power of me folk t' accomplish alone.${prompt};
I beg ye, ${name-player}, please keep lendin' us yer strength! Stand with us t' the bloody end!${prompt};
How will you respond?;
${selection-lines};
If you need a hero, look no further!;
It's just too big a commitment.${prompt};
Words alone aren't enough t' express me gratitude, ${name-player}.;
With yer help, Abyssea will surely again be restored t' the beauteous realm she once was.${prompt};
I know I ask much of ye, ${name-player}, an' fer that I'm sorry.;
We'd still appreciate yer aid, though, in whatever quantity ye can offer. Please jus' don't turn yer back on us.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Always a sight fer sore eyes.;
I've got a message fer ye here, from ye-know-who. Needs t' speak with ye again, he says.${prompt};
The location's the same, out at the stone circle in La Theine.;
As fer the time, remember what I told ye earlier.${prompt};
While I'm not privy t' the purpose of this next meetin', I know the man wouldn't cross over here fer whimsical reasons.${prompt};
That he'd come again so soon doesn't bode well, I fear...${prompt};
The meetin' went all right, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt};
Aye, the old man's certainly fond o' talkin'.;
Mind ye don't go divulgin' the conversation t' me or the others, though.${prompt};
Were it somethin' meant fer our ears, we would've already heard about it.${prompt};
Certain things are confidential fer a reason, I think ye'll agree.${prompt};
I'd be a great big liar if I said I wasn't at all curious.;
On the other hand, though, I fear what learnin' the truth might be liable t' do t' me sanity.${prompt};
Countless unbelievable things've come t' pass since that fateful day.${prompt};
Afore the cataclysm, any talk of dimensional travel would've been met with ridicule.${prompt};
Lookin' back, we were all happier then, blissful in our ignorance.${prompt};
Wakin' up one day, suddenly findin' meself capable o' traversin' dimensions...that was a bloody huge shock, I tell ye.;
But I digress...${prompt};
Gilgamesh claims not t' possess full knowledge of things, but it's clear enough he's better informed than most.${prompt};
I've got a hunch that be part of the reason why he specifically picked ye out.;
I won't badger ye fer the details, though.${prompt};
I've got me own job t' do, an' I mean t' do it well.;
I must continue recruitin' strong adventurers t' aid our plight.${prompt};
And ye, ${name-player}. Me comrades an' I hope we can keep relyin' on yer trusty sword arm.${prompt};
I trust yer journeys in Abyssea've introduced ye t' the defensive structures we call martellos.${prompt};
The ones garrisoned in Vunkerl, Attohwa, and Misareaux are earlier models what need t' have their power augmented from a central location.;
An outpost has been established in each area especially fer this purpose.${prompt};
However, the Abyssean fiends've somehow caught wind of the outposts' true nature.;
Since then they've been hell-bent on tearin' them t' the ground.${prompt};
If an outpost were t' fall, the effectiveness of all martellos in the area'd be gravely compromised.;
Suffice it t' say, that'd be right disastrous fer the resistance effort.${prompt};
I realize ye're already doin' much fer us, but the outposts sorely lack fer defenders.;
I'd volunteer meself fer the job, weren't I stuck here in Vana'diel.${prompt};
I beseech ye, ${name-player}, help us t' defend the outposts!;
Think of it as doin' a personal favor fer me!${prompt};
Ye never cease t' amaze me, ${name-player}. Why, not only did ye shine in yer defense of the outposts, ye even managed t' slay those vicious fiends what've wreaked havoc upon us fer so long.${prompt};
Words can't express how glad I am t' have ye fightin' on our side.${prompt};
Ah, what I wouldn't give t' possess even half yer strength--t' be able t' do somethin' fer me own folk.;
But...there's somethin' I mus' confess.${prompt};
A part of me's grateful fer bein' stranded here. Thankful that I never again have t' set foot upon that hell on earth.;
That I think such cowardly thoughts...it racks me with guilt, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Ye...ye understand how I feel, ye say?${prompt};
Ye truly are a kindhearted soul.;
It's a rare ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who possesses both strength an' compassion in abundance like ye.${prompt};
Please forgive me fer that unseemly display.;
The pressures of me world's plight can be overwhelmin' at times.${prompt};
${name-player}. I pray ye never cease t' be the ray of hope fer the folk of Abyssea.${prompt};
Oh, my... Such a pristine, untainted world...${prompt};
Greetings, friend. Delighted to finally meet you.;
My name is Horst, and I have the utmost pleasure of being Joachim's assistant.${prompt};
I also derive much pleasure from assisting the brave, selfless souls who have made our cause their own.${prompt};
If there is anything you wish to know regarding Abyssea, it would delight me so to share my knowledge with you.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
My current cruor balance.;
Resistance outpost status.;
Teleporting to a cavernous maw.;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
According to my logbook--which is kept to the highest standards--you have ${number: 0} cruor in your possession.${prompt};
Ask about which area?;
${selection-lines};
Abyssea - Vunkerl.;
Abyssea - Misareaux.;
Abyssea - Attohwa.;
Never mind.${prompt};
According to the latest intelligence reports...${prompt};
This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at ${number: 0}%.;
The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is ${number: 1}%.${prompt};
You'd like to teleport to a cavernous maw?;
Through the power of the little red pretties we call cruor, I shall be overjoyed to assist you!${prompt};
Go to which area's gateway?;
${selection-lines};
Abyssea - La Theine.;
Abyssea - Konschtat.;
Abyssea - Tahrongi.;
Abyssea - Vunkerl.;
Abyssea - Misareaux.;
Abyssea - Attohwa.;
Abyssea - Altepa.;
Abyssea - Uleguerand.;
Abyssea - Grauberg.;
I've changed my mind.${prompt};
${number: 1} cruor is required to teleport to the gateway to Abyssea - ${choice: 0}[La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].${prompt};
Oh, my, it seems you don't have enough cruor.${prompt};
Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: ${number: 2});
${selection-lines};
Make it so.;
Make it no.${prompt};
These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes.;
Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos.;
Would you be needing something of me?${prompt};
Need something?;
${selection-lines};
Assist with replenishment.;
Assist with upgrades.;
Martellos? Come again?;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort.;
To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} into the structure.${prompt};
Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Take along the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations.;
Best of luck in your efforts!${prompt};
Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?;
You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt};
I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?${prompt};
You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in its stead!${prompt};
Your support is most heartening in these dark times.;
Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.;
You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.;
Be careful out there!${prompt};
Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?;
You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt};
Is that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} I see?;
Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt};
Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.;
How did you fare in your efforts?${prompt};
I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?;
It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt};
The resistance greatly values your contributions.;
Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt};
I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.;
Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt};
Ask something?;
${selection-lines};
So, what's a martello?;
Martello replenishment.;
Martello upgrades.;
Cautionary notes.;
Not now.${prompt};
The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.;
Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt};
You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt};
In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.;
Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt};
That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt};
I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.;
Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.;
Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?;
Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt};
An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.;
Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt};
Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.;
As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.;
Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt};
'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Warning:;
Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.;
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.;
The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.;
Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} breaks!;
Table: ${number: 0};
Grauberg, Altepa Desert, Uleguerand Range...${prompt};
The monsters what prowl these three areas in Abyssea are right frightful, I tell ye.;
Why, the ones ye've dealt with so far would seem as tame kittens beside 'em.${prompt};
But that ain't the half of it, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].;
Even if ye took away the threat of nasty beasties, Altepa an' Uleguerand are in an' of themselves perilous places.${prompt};
These two locales represent some of the world's harshest environments, utterly ill-suited fer sustainin' life.${prompt};
We gotta make haste an' pave an evacuation route fer the survivors, else they won't be in the survivin' business fer much longer.${prompt};
The casualties are mountin' even as we speak, ${name-player}, folk dyin' of exposure, starvation, simple maladies...${prompt};
I know we've played out this scene upwards of a dozen times...but I mus' ask fer yer help yet again.${prompt};
I beg ye, ${name-player}! Please do what ye can fer the embattled folk of Abyssea!${prompt};
By the heavens, ${name-player}! Ye truly did it...ye did fer that detestable menace!;
Is there no limit t' yer potential, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt};
When word of yer amazin' deed reached me ears, me whole body fair trembled with excitement.;
With a staunch comrade such as ye fightin' beside us, there's nothin' me folk and I need fear.${prompt};
Now, I'm not so naive as t' celebrate prematurely. I know full well it'll take much time an' effort yet afore our former lives are restored.${prompt};
But we've managed t' cast off the shackles of despair, a right momentous first step.${prompt};
The situation's taken a turn fer the better all across the land, an' we owe it all t' ye, ${name-player}.;
I honestly don't know where we'd be without ye.${prompt};
From what vile loins were the Abyssean hordes spawned? And why did the sky take on a bloody red?;
Questions such as these remain unanswered, t' be sure.${prompt};
But with the aid of ye an' yers, we're gettin' closer an' closer t' uncoverin' the truth.${prompt};
Ah, don't be takin' me comment the wrong way, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].;
The help ye've already afforded us verges on immeasurable, an' it's not me intention t' put undue pressure on ye.${prompt};
Havin' said that, I hope ye'll stand with us through t' the very end.${prompt};
The location's different this time, mind ye.;
Ye ever heard of the Hall of the Gods, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt};
I'll fill ye in on the directions, jus' fer good measure.;
T' get there, first leave the Meriphataud Mountains from the northeast. Ye should find yerself standin' in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, the gateway way t' the Li'Telor Region.${prompt};
Make yer way north through the coniferous forest, an ye'll wind up in the sprawlin' ruins of Ro'Maeve. Proceed further on in, an' ye'll eventually come upon the Hall of the Gods.${prompt};
In olden times, the place was said t' be the destination fer many a pilgrim.;
Nowadays, though, ye're more like t' bump into spirits. There's nary a better place fer hush-hush dealings, I reckon.${prompt};
As I explained afore, the man can only step over t' this side fer short durations.;
Aye, fer him t' pick such an isolated meetin' location tells me something's afoot.${prompt};
As fer the time, remember what I told ye earlier.${prompt};
From what I know, ye can get as far as Ro'Maeve on chocoboback, though the poor beasts balk at enterin' the ruins.;
A teleport spell would also help quicken the journey a deal.${prompt};
Now, this is probably needless of me t' say, ${name-player}, but be careful out there, eh?${prompt};
Time and place're the same as afore, the Hall of the Gods deep within Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
What's that, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?;
It bothers ye that I don't seem even the slightest bit curious, ye say?${prompt};
T' be fair, I've been made privy t' bits an' pieces.;
As a matter of fact, the chance was dangled in front of me t' learn the whole truth.${prompt};
Thing is, I wasn't able t' muster up the courage t' reach out fer it. Shied away at the last moment.${prompt};
“There be things better left in the shadows, matey,” that ol' sea dog said.${prompt};
An' so I resolved t' stay ignorant in me bliss fer a while longer, an' have been keepin' me peace.${prompt};
Given a bit of time, though, the day'll come when I'm ready t' face the truth of things.${prompt};
In anywise, ye best be goin' now, ${name-player}. Else me ramblin' is never like t' end.${prompt};
${name-player}, a moment.${prompt};
I heard ye did fer those dreadful caturae creatures.;
As it happens, we discovered somethin' of interest. All the juicy details, ye can get from ye-know-who.${prompt};
There's one more thing. I...finally found out. About everythin'.${prompt};
It was so...fantastical. Every word so far beyond the realm of logic, I was struck dumb.;
But then again, how else could ye explain the cause fer the devastation what's befallen Abyssea?${prompt};
I'm told ye've got a mind t' go it against a divinity, ${name-player}.;
I can't help but scratch me head at why ye'd do so much fer a world that isn't even yer own.${prompt};
It's been botherin' me, ${name-player}.;
Won't ye tell me what drives ye, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]?${prompt};
Why do you fight for Abyssea?;
${selection-lines};
I'm an adventurer!;
Just because!;
${prompt};
Ye fight because ye're...an adventurer?;
I've always thought ye lot were strange, but yer reply pretty much sets me sentiments in stone.${prompt};
Just because, ye say? I'd like t' think folk'd have a good reason t' defy the will of a god, but I s'pose not.${prompt};
There're many mysteries in the world, an' ye adventurers are definitely one of 'em.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} grins knowingly at Joachim.;
That grin ye wear speaks volumes, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass]. Aye, that it does.${prompt};
“A right mysterious bunch they were, as many an' unique as the fishes in the sea, arggg,” the old man would oft say...again an' again till me ears fair bled.;
Might be the world's changed beyond recognition, but it's reassurin' t' know some things'll always stay the same.${prompt};
Sorry once again, ${name-player}, fer holdin' ye up. It's become a terrible habit of mine.;
I jus' want ye t' know I appreciate these little conversations we have.${prompt};
There's somethin' I've been meanin' t' give ye.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It's a memento of me home, somethin' I haven't been able t' let go of till now.;
I'm entrustin' it t' ye, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], as a token of me faith in ye.${prompt};
Me faith that ye'll do right by the folk of Abyssea.${prompt};
Is that right... So it'll be a while yet afore lives return t' normal.;
T' be sure, it'd be naive t' believe all the damage what Abyssea sustained could be undone overnight.${prompt};
Deep down, though, I allowed meself t' hope.;
I'd be lyin' through me teeth if I said I weren't disappointed.${prompt};
Regardless, I take great joy in knowin' that mankind is saved.;
An' that me mates an' I, our comin' an' bein' stranded here wasn't in vain.${prompt};
I want t' thank ye again, ${name-player}--both ye an' yers--from the bottom o' me heart.;
A more courageous, valiant crew I've never known!${prompt};
By the bye, I've got here another message fer ye, from the usual suspects.${prompt};
They want t' see ye soon as ye got back, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].;
Said they'll be waitin' at the same time, same place.${prompt};
Ye know the deal, aye?${prompt};
Do you know the deal?;
${selection-lines};
How could I ever forget?;
Tell me again, just in case.${prompt};
The details escaped yer mind, did they? Well, small wonder, considerin' the excitement of recent days.;
The Hall of the Gods, deep within Ro'Maeve, is where ye want t' go, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass].${prompt};
${name-player}, a moment.${prompt};
It jus' crossed me mind, but what will ye do now that Abyssea's saved from her fate of certain destruction?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Go fulfill a promise.${prompt};
A promise? Ye mean the one ye made t' that girl ye jus' mentioned?${prompt};
At any rate...;
${selection-lines};
You can leave Abyssea to me!;
Have the ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} ready!${prompt};
Hahaha! I will, ${choice-player-gender}[mate/lass], don't ye worry yer head off 'bout it.;
I guarantee ye, I'll be here t' assist ye any way I know how...till the day me flesh an' bones turn t' dust!${prompt};
Very well, friend.;

The chest is empty.;
The Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza is in full swing! Just open this chest to claim your prize.${prompt};
You can claim it anytime you want during the campaign, but don't wait too long. You can't claim squat after the campaign ends.${prompt};
Anyway, do you want your Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza gifts or not?${prompt};
Receive the gifts?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
No thanks.${prompt};
Gift 1:;
Eleven different types of atma.;

Gift 4:;
The ability to store 100 more traverser stones!;
*You may check your stock of stones by speaking with Joachim or other applicable Abyssean personages.${prompt};
Your traverser stone stock has increased by 100!${prompt};
Now that you have all the gifts, it's time to put them to use in Abyssea!${prompt};
You're able to claim these amazing Abyssean gifts, so go talk to Joachim in Port Jeuno (H-8) before it's too late.${prompt};
The Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza event has concluded.${prompt};
I've been charged with looking after the equipment of heroes and heroines past.${prompt};

Whaddaya mean you've got enough? Way to ruin my sales pitch, ${choice-player-gender}[buddy/lady].;
Just be quiet and listen, will ya?${prompt};
You can call me Shemo. I'm Shami's brother.;
(And just between you and me, I'm the brains behind this operation.)${prompt};
Here's the deal. Is my big bro holdin' onto any old crests or seals that ya don't need?;
Well, I can offer you one shiny new seal--any seal--of your choice for ${number: 4} of yours.${prompt};
Whaddaya think of that?${prompt};
Hm? Why three, ya ask?;
Hey, a trader's gotta turn a profit somehow, right?${prompt};
So, how you doin' on seals and crests these days?;
If you want to make a trade, Shemo's got ya covered.;
Just say the word.${prompt};
Make a trade?;
${selection-lines};
Let's do it.;
Not today.;
Wait, how does this work?${prompt};
Hmph. And here I thought you were a ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal] who knew a good deal when ya saw one.;
Fine, we didn't need your business anyway.${prompt};

Shami and I, we work together, y'see.${prompt};
Don't worry, I won't be skimmin' nothin' off the top.;

Whoa there, now! Our Gobbiebags can't hold every seal in the realm, ya know.;
You're gonna have to make a trade or purchase before ya give us any more.${prompt};

If you've got any beastmen's seals, Kindred's crests, or what-have-ya, you'll want to trade 'em to me or my brother here.;
Trust me. We'll make it worth your while.)${prompt};
Hey, you tryin' to pull a fast one on me?;
You've only got ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Wait a minute. That couldn't be...but it is!;
Yes, that's ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} if I've ever seen one!${prompt};
But you don't even know what it is, do you?;
Clearly not, the way it's stuffed willy-nilly in your Gobbiebag like a fistful of batagreens!${prompt};
You should thank the Goddess that you ran into Shami today, my friend!;
Because if there's one thing Shami knows, Shami knows value!${prompt};
Here's what Shami can do for you.;
I'll kindly take that curio off your hands and give you something equally impressive, but far more practical for an adventurer like yourself!${prompt};
And if you've got anything similar to that ${item-singular: 0[2]}, I'll trade for that as well!${prompt};
I've traveled far and wide tracking down the most extraordinary treasures from the shiftiest, shadiest traders in the realm so you don't have to!;
Just trade me the goods, and these riches can be yours!${prompt};
You cannot carry any more items.;
Make the trade again after sorting your inventory.${prompt};
Wonderful! There's a suck--;
Er, a satisfied customer born every minute!${prompt};
Now you know where the best deals in the Duchy are!;
So don't hesitate to come back, you hear?${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;

${color-alt: 15}Oboro took your ${item-singular: 0[2]} without even asking!;
Ahhh... Ohhh...;
What a positively breathtaking artifact. Now I have something else to absorb myself in other than the masterful teachings of Borghertz.${prompt};
My apologies, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]. Gazing upon the intricacies of well-crafted blades and staves is a truly mesmerizing experience, and I often lose myself between their individual grains and grooves. At any rate, social custom dictates that I return this to you.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The uncouth Hume begrudgingly hands over your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Yes, it would certainly do you well to know my name. I go by Oboro, and as a blacksmith from the Far East, I contrive exquisite instruments of assault almost from thin air.${prompt};
While I am undoubtedly the most accomplished smith in my homeland, I am not an arrogant Elvaan. I have heard the rumors of Borghertz's greatness and have come to broaden my horizons under his wing.${prompt};
Know you of Borghertz, the legendary blacksmith revered throughout the Far East?${prompt};
Do you know Borghertz?;
${selection-lines};
In fact, I do...or did.;
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.${prompt};
What!? He has passed on and hammers away happily upon the big anvil in the sky!?${prompt};
Of course someone of your inferior stature would not. That is all well and good, however, for we are not all destined for greatness.${prompt};
Oh well, let us not dwell on extraneous and repugnant details. Now that I have seen the almighty armament you carry...${prompt};
I would have you bequeath it to me.${prompt};
If Borghertz is not available to perform this most ambitious of tasks, then I will gladly accept the challenge of eking out every last iota of might from your weapon.${prompt};
I cannot tell a lie. I will stake my illustrious career and own life on this claim.${prompt};
So, what say you?${prompt};
What say you?;
${selection-lines};
Fine, have my weapon.;
You're a jerk and I hate you.${prompt};
Hmph.;
Well, such is your loss. You will simply be unable to defend this city once the apocalypse descends upon it--which will happen sooner than you think.${prompt};
Ah, it pleases me to know that you possess the intuition of a true combatant. No one would refuse the opportunity to increase the potency of the tool by which they make their living.${prompt};
I would like nothing more than to start remolding this exquisite creation immediately, but I must first say that I cannot and will not work with anything less than the best. Consider the weapon you possess and bring me weapons that meet or exceed its power.${prompt};
And let us suppose you actually procure what I ask of you. Will you even be able to grasp the degree to which your life will change, all thanks to my expertise? Heh heh heh, I can hardly wait.${prompt};
Why the long face? Did you wet yourself at the thought of losing your closest companion?;
No worries, I shall be waiting in this very spot when your trousers dry and your resolve hardens.${prompt};
Finally come to your senses and realize that leaving your weapon with me is the best option you have?${prompt};
I was unaware that the world was still privy to superlative works of art such as this. So grandiose is its design that one must question whether or not it was fashioned by mortal hands.${prompt};
Say nothing of the aura it exudes. I feel as if I am conversing with an old friend simply by gazing upon it.;
Yes, I will indeed deign to pour my soul into improving this instrument.${prompt};
In order to do that, however, I require ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Have fun getting intimately acquainted with them as well as the beasts from which you must procure them.${prompt};
Well, now...if I did not so love hearing the sound of my own voice, I would be at a loss for words. To think that I would one day come across one of the Myriad Arms of Balrahn...${prompt};
I knew it was my destiny to lay eyes upon one when I first glanced at that ledger of arcane valuables. It seems there was a purpose in coming to this backwoods province after all.${prompt};
I cannot in good conscience turn down the chance to pour my heart and soul into this magnificent creation.${prompt};
And to assist me in this divine mission, you will bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Now be off.${prompt};
Egads, I thought these were merely legend...;
Perhaps I should give those floating furballs a tad more credit.${prompt};
How do I improve upon perfection?;
Hmmm, this will prove to be quite the challenge, but overcoming it will surely prove my incomparable talents to the world.${prompt};
Now shoo and fetch me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} posthaste if you wish to see my efforts succeed.${prompt};
I told you already, ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.;
“Where can I find them?”;
Do I look like I have lived here the entirety of my existence? Find them yourself!${prompt};
I would thank you for handing over your ${item-plural: 0[2]}, but you have only done what is logical for our mutual benefit.;
More importantly, I can already feel the potential of this great weapon.${prompt};
One day is but all I need to work my magic.;
Feel free to get your hopes up in the meantime, too.${prompt};
Here is what I promised you, and nothing less. No need to comment upon the craftsmanship, for I already know it is flawless.${prompt};
Prepare your body to shudder with excitement when you see the transformation your partner-in-arms has undergone. Now go about your business like a faithful servant and get me what I need.${prompt};
Yes, this is it...this is what you have kept me waiting so long for. All is forgiven, for it is exactly as I pictured it.${prompt};
I will need you to wait a day while I set to smithing.;
No need to turn red with anger. A day is but an instant when compared to your adventuring lifetime.${prompt};
What a beautiful piece that Balrahn armament was...but it was not even half as beautiful as its current form. Take it in your hands and steel your bladder against your ensuing amazement.${prompt};
I can do nothing until you procure me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, so make haste to acquire them. In the meantime, I will visualize the shape on which my chef d'oeuvre shall take.${prompt};
Ah, your ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Very well, you are of no more use to me. Skedaddle and occupy yourself with some paltry distraction while the adults do the real work.${prompt};
It will take approximately one day to perform my wonders upon it, so do not come pulling at my coattails asking, “Is it done yet?” until then.${prompt};
Even I am impressed with the craftsmanship of this piece. I would be jealous of the moogles and their magic...except I know I can create even more stunning ordnance when given the chance. Here it is, in all its new splendid glory.${prompt};
I had no idea adventurers possessed so much free time. No matter how many times you ask, it will be ready when it is ready...unless you would rather I hand you a half-finished piece of scrap.${prompt};
Of course I could never bring myself to hand back a work in progress. You will wait your full day and you will like it, hear me?${prompt};
I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed working with the piece you had the sense to give me, and would not be averse to enhancing any others you may have acquired.${prompt};
<Ahem>${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Prepare the weapon!;
Nothing.${prompt};
What is it you need from me?${prompt};
What do you need from him?;
${selection-lines};
To know what the deal is.;
Nothing.${prompt};
...Hmph.;
Be that as it may, you will come crawling back for my services sooner or later.${prompt};
Oho, was that a figment of my imagination, or did your aura just resonate with mine? Pardon me if it took a moment to realize that someone of such low station as you could possibly hope to pique my interest.${prompt};
...I am sorry if you have been offended by the truth, but you adventurers have given me little reason to reconsider my position. If you cannot handle the sparks that fly from my tongue, perhaps you should invest in a thicker skin before concerning yourself with weapons.${prompt};
I grow weary of elucidating obvious information to a clodpoll such as you, but at least your skills with a weapon look to be sharper than your mind.${prompt};
A lauded blacksmith like myself can decipher in an instant that your piece is of some merit...“some” being the operative word.${prompt};
No need to get defensive. Yeesh, it is amazing how you were able to survive any battles with a head as hot as that.${prompt};
What I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted is that even I at times require your assistance. While I may not be able to trust in your brains, I can put a modicum of faith in your brawn.${prompt};
As for your reward, it shall be an armament more resilient than anything you have wielded previously. Do you not wish to hold in your hands greatness incarnate--fashioned by the best smithy in the land?${prompt};
Do you want said equipment?;
${selection-lines};
Do you even have to ask!?;
Not if you make it.${prompt};
I had the utmost confidence that such talk would get you slobbering in anticipation. The best part is that you will not even have to use that pea-sized brain of yours.${prompt};
Simply procure me a few materials that have yet to find their way to market and I will lend you my boundless prowess to create a tool of extraordinary puissance.${prompt};
You need not even trouble yourself over sums, for they are all divvied up according to weapon.${prompt};
As long as you can muster the determination to choose an item, I will tell you the type and number of materials you must amass for me to craft it.${prompt};
Designate which you will from the list, which I shall show you henceforth, to begin the adventure.${prompt};
Oh, there you are. As it so happens, I <cough> require your assistance <cough>. In return, I--in my infinite magnanimity--am willing to offer you some newly crafted ordnance.${prompt};
Think of it...an armament the likes of which has never been seen before, fashioned by a smithy among smithies. How could you not covet so phenomenal a treasure?${prompt};
Do you want such a weapon?;
${selection-lines};
Without question.;
It's not worth listening to you.${prompt};
The number of materials needed differs depending upon the weapon, a fact which you would do well to keep in mind...though I am to understand the borders of yours are quite small.${prompt};
Which do you desire?;

About the weapons.;
Go back.;
None.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Very well, then.;
For that I require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Furthermore, I need ${number: 7} ${item-given-plurality: 7[2], 4[2]}, ${item-given-plurality: 7[2], 5[2]}, or ${item-given-plurality: 7[2], 6[2]}.${prompt};
You would do well to remember that I am not some hack who labors in the Metalworks. I require exact numbers if I am to forge a decent piece.${prompt};
I am happy to see that you can, at the very least, be a competent beast of burden. Feel free to go into hibernation for a day while I perform tasks that require true sentience.${prompt};
I must say that I have certainly outdone myself this time. Enjoy this paragon of martial excellence.${prompt};
Ahhh... Ohhh...;
What a positively breathtaking artifact. So it is indeed true that “a journey a day keeps one's skills from wasting away.”${prompt};
I still consider you a bit of a cur, but I also believe you could make the most of this offer I have regarding that almighty armament you carry. To cut to the quick...${prompt};
Oh, look! It's my favorite waste of materials. Back for another...${wait-36: 1};
Wait. What is...?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You proffer your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
By Altana!${prompt};
Despite all our one-sided dealings, ${name-player}, I must admit that I have misjudged you. Bring me that which I have remolded for you previously, and I shall see what I can do.${prompt};
Ah, a fine piece of work, indeed. But tell me--are you satisfied with it? Truly, truly satisfied?${prompt};
Well?;
${selection-lines};
I suppose.;
Not entirely.${prompt};
Oho. Your tastes are as non-discerning as ever. But if you're content with eating slop out of a horse trough, then who am I to stop you?${prompt};
Hmm... ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
The perfect catalyst to add a little more oomph to the masterpiece I created for you before.${prompt};
Oh, and lest you think it'll be destroyed in the process, let me set your mind at ease--I only need to borrow a little bit of its power.${prompt};
Of course, I'll need more than just that--and you'll have to come up with the materials yourself.${prompt};
Now, as for that precious implement of destruction, I'll need...${wait-36: 1};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
You know where to find me once you've made the grand leap from sloth into action.${prompt};
Back with the goods, eh? Taking into account the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} you've just given me, I'll need ${number: 2} more.${prompt};
I've got enough ${item-plural: 0[2]}--now all I'll need is for you to bring the weapon in question.${prompt};
That should be all I require. I should have your new armament ready in the next couple days. A master requires time.${prompt};
You've given me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} so far. Another ${number: 3} should do the trick for your ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
If you want to halt the process, that's fine by me--but don't expect me to return any of the materials you've already delivered.${prompt};
Really abandon the process?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You absolutely mean it?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
Definitely.;
Maybe not.${prompt};
What is--this clearly isn't my work!${prompt};
But it is intruiging...permit me a closer inspection.${prompt};
Fascinating! Fashioned with a technique that I have never seen!${prompt};
Heh heh...I could live for ten thousand years and not have seen all the world has to offer.${prompt};
Along with what you brought me, I'll also need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
An artisan of my caliber should find those two things sufficient.${prompt};
The idea of bringing your weapon to even greater heights gets your blood pumping, doesn't it?${prompt};
Is your blood pumping?;
${selection-lines};
So much that I'm dizzy!;
Not really.${prompt};
That's what a man likes to hear!${prompt};
But that same man cannot work without his tools. And in this case, not something you can pick up in a market on the way home.${prompt};
I should be able to work a bit of the ol' magic using that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you have.${prompt};
I'll need ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}--but don't go around mixing them together willy-nilly, else the whole process will go up in smoke.${prompt};
That is to say, you needn't give me all of them at once. Stop by every so often with what you've acquired.${prompt};
Back with what I need? Good.;
I haven't yet used the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. If I do, I won't be able to use any of the others. Ready?${prompt};
Really use the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
You bet!;
I need time to think.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
This piece might be a little bit better than the last time, but I bet I could get it to shine even brighter. Stop by later if you're interested.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Everything has its limits, and this piece is no exception. I've done all I can.${prompt};
Let me return your materials.${prompt};
Ha! It's as I've always said--a more competent smith you'll find nowhere else!${prompt};
Go ahead--give it a swing!${prompt};
Yes? Is there something you need?${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Show me the list.;
Upgrading my equipment even further.;
Equipment from the shrouded world.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Hm...? That ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you're holding... Let me see it.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You showed Oboro the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Yes...yes, indeed... I just might be able to... Oh, forgive me.${prompt};
This equipment of yours... If I told you I could hone it to greater heights of power, what would you say?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Most definitely!;
Maybe another time.${prompt};
Splendid! Then let us get right to it... Or rather, that's what I'd like to say. But I fear it's not possible at this precise moment.${prompt};
Needless to say, it is not my prowess that is lacking, but rather that my current tools aren't sturdy enough to survive the job.${prompt};
However, the power given off by your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... With that, I'd surely be able to work my wonders on your ${choice: 1}[mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon].${prompt};
Don't worry, I won't be taking that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands for good. I merely need to borrow a bit of its power.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Lend it to him.;
Never mind.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Oboro eagerly takes hold of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Now wait just a moment. I'll return shortly.${prompt};
Wonderful! Your ${choice: 0}[mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon] is ready to experience my powers in all their glory... Ah, forgive me. You can have this back now.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Oboro relinquished the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Do you have anything else like that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? I would love to work my wonders on another piece of equipment for you.${prompt};
Now I just need the necessary materials in order to work my magic. As you know, I am a smith without equal. Bring me what I need, and I'll see to the rest.${prompt};
That said, the materials I require this time are somewhat special. Without them, I fear I won't be able to help you.${prompt};
"To be more precise, they're not ""materials"" as such, but rather something near and dear to you. You could even say they're like your heart and soul. Yes, that is what I need.${prompt}";
You're an experienced adventurer, so I'm sure you can figure out what I mean.${prompt};
Anyhow, once you find that of which I speak, pray deliver it to me.${prompt};
Hmm... Yes...in the state that you're in now, I suppose I could...${prompt};
...Ahem. I have a proposal for you. Are you interested?${prompt};
Are you interested?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
I think not.${prompt};
I can take that fancy armament of yours to even greater heights. That said, I can't do it right at this moment.${prompt};
No...before I work my magic on your little friend there, I'll need to enhance my tools using the power of your equipment.${prompt};
In other words, I'm asking you to help me help you.${prompt};
By using your experience to enhance my tools, I can upgrade that equipment of yours. For that, I'll just need some of your job points.${prompt};
Just give me your job points from jobs where you can't earn any more. I'll use them to get my tools up to snuff and forge a piece of equipment that'll knock your socks off.${prompt};
I think 10,000 job points ought to do it. I believe you can use up to 700 job points per week (Earth time)...${prompt};
We have to do this right though. Mess around and my tools won't be up to the job, leaving you with your boring old equipment. And none of us want that, right?${prompt};
Lastly, I'll need to use the right tools for the job. That means you'll need enough job points to cover each type of equipment you want to augment.${prompt};
You used ${number: 0} job ${choice-plurality: 0}[point/points] for your ${choice: 1}[mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon]. You still need ${number: 2} job ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points], and are able to use ${number: 3} more ${choice-plurality: 3}[point/points].${prompt};
Now, I can finally get around to taking care of that ${choice: 1}[mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon] for you.${prompt};
You used ${number: 0} job ${choice-plurality: 0}[point/points] for the ${choice: 1}[mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon]. I'm afraid you don't have any points left to use.${prompt};
You can't use any more job points. I'm afraid you'll need to come back later.${prompt};
Hm? What's that? Did you do that yourself? It looks like it's been altered somehow...${prompt};
If I only knew more about it, I might be able to help... Would you mind telling me what you did?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Tell him about the shrouded world.;
Stay quiet.${prompt};
An hourglass? A dreamlike world shrouded in fog? Hmm... I might be able to do something with this, but not in its current state...${prompt};
Hmm... ${choice: 1}[This is/Once again you've brought me something] most interesting... It's not much, but there would seem to be fragments of memories within the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Make your selection and I shall extract it for you.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Route A.;
Route B.;
Route C.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
On second thought...${prompt};
It may be a strange way of phrasing it, but it feels as if it's “alive” somehow...${prompt};
If you equip it in that world, I daresay it should give things a nice boost.${prompt};
Of course, you can upgrade your equipment in this world, too...provided you have a certain something. Should you find that something, pray bring it to me.${prompt};
This equipment may yet be augmented further. Pray bring it back to me some time.${prompt};
This equipment has reached the limit of its powers. I'm afraid I can do no more with it.${prompt};
That equipment of yours... Let me see it.${prompt};
Hmm... How interesting... Actually, it reminds me of the equipment of my homeland.${prompt};
But forgive me. I wasn't expecting to see such a familiar item here. Sorry, you can have it back now.${prompt};
Let me take another look at your equipment.${prompt};
Truly fascinating... Ahem. Forgive me. The craftsmanship seemed unfamiliar to me, so I merely wanted to take a closer look.${prompt};
This equipment seems to have slumbered for ages in a land far to the west.${prompt};
What will you choose?;

Yo, ${name-player}, I hauled tail as soon as I heard!${prompt};
Oh, my! I hear things have gotten a bit rough lately!${prompt};
You shoulda heard Tenzen prattle on! Dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!${prompt};
Figured the old fart was trying to pull the wool over my eyes.${prompt};
C'mon. Even if the world were really in danger, all it would take is a quick few shakes of my fist and everything'd be right as rain.${prompt};
I mean, seriously.${wait-36: 2};
Right?${prompt};
I admit his ominous words were a bit scary. The world is dying, the future is bleak...${prompt};
Now that I'm no longer able to look deeply into people's hearts, I couldn't tell if he was playing a cruel joke.${prompt};

We already put a lid on that messy business, so there's nothing left to worry about!${prompt};
Lady Prishe...? Are you feeling ill?${prompt};
Why, most certainly.${prompt};
How else would one feel when an old friend comes bearing ill tidings about the end of the world?${prompt};
Have we not already solved this problem? Why would it rear its ugly head anew? It's enough to set my head swimming!${prompt};
Ah, that would explain it. I must confess to having difficulty discerning my right from my left as well these past weeks...${prompt};
This creepy old coot rushes in and starts blabbing about dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!${prompt};
The blood rushed to my head and now it's pounding like I just ran face-first into a wall!${prompt};
Ah. Well, that solves the mystery of his obnoxious prattling.${prompt};
Then this whole “Emptiness” thing's gotta be connected, right?${prompt};
And you mean to say that it's our destiny to send it packing?${prompt};

Lady Prishe, are you not the least bit concerned!?${prompt};
All those close to you, whether in Tavnazia or beyond, are in grave danger!${prompt};
Yeah, yeah. But what good does it do any of us to sit here with our thumbs up our butts moaning about it?${prompt};
Less talk, more action!${prompt};
A most becoming response. But how are we to act when we know so little?${prompt};
Didn't you mention something 'bout a delicate little waif from the future who had all the answers?${prompt};
Unfortunately, although Iroha can see the grand picture, there are many details that escape her.${prompt};
The one most familiar with the situation is he who came after her.${prompt};
This ambassador from the void guy, yeah. I've half a mind to rip that mask from his scrawny little neck and expose him for the sham he is!${prompt};
And this would be your masked ambassador from the void?${prompt};
Would that our paths had crossed, but I know only his name.${prompt};
And that ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player} and Lady Iroha sparred with him.${prompt};

That's the ${name-player} I know and love!${prompt};
Hang on--you didn't actually smack him around, did you!?${prompt};
Can't fool me! My fingers start to twitch whenever someone's trying to finagle their way out of the truth!${prompt};
That's wonderful news!${prompt};
Wait. Was that...a joke?${prompt};
How undeniably cruel! Why would you get any enjoyment out of toying with me?${prompt};
Thinkin' he can just snatch victory like candy from a babe, no doubt!${prompt};
Let him do what he wants, I say! I'll mangle his face so bad he'll never dare to remove that mask!${prompt};
If he's as impressive as you claim, I would surely like to meet him.${prompt};
But goodness, my knees would certainly turn to jelly.${prompt};
This is no time for nonsense. That man can call forth voids at will.${prompt};
Wait...there's something desperately wrong...${prompt};
Hm?;
Aaaaaah!;
Hm?;
Eeep!;
There is no need for concern, Lady Prishe.${prompt};
The same thing happened earlier. The orb filling with light--this is what Iroha was mentioning, is it not?${prompt};
Urk! I thought the damn thing was trying to rip my soul from my body!${prompt};
Lady Prishe, I assure you no such thing would occur.${prompt};
Hmph. Long as I'm still in one piece I couldn't give a flying fig.${prompt};
But let's track back a minute to where we can find this Iroha of yours.${prompt};
I...I felt like my soul was being ripped from my body!${prompt};
Thank the heavens! Hopefully my shivers will calm down...${prompt};
But wait--where can we find Iroha?${prompt};
She had promised to be here...${prompt};
Do you suppose something happened to her?${prompt};
What do you think?;
${selection-lines};
Maybe she got lost?;
She didn't seem well.;
Think she forgot?${prompt};
Only in the most dire of circumstances is a priestess from Reisenjima Sanctorium permitted to leave the tiny island.${prompt};
And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!${prompt};
So you're saying she let it hurl? That can't be good.${prompt};
Whatever shall we do?${prompt};
A priestess's calling is to remain sheltered in her cloister and pray to the gods.${prompt};
And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!${prompt};
She probably caught a whiff of some sausages or something and is gorging herself as we speak.${prompt};
Lady Prishe, a priestess from the Far East is not tempted by such carnal desires.${prompt};
Well, she must have found some stunning number and is flitting from store to store wasting ponzes of gil on cute little baubles.${prompt};
Ahem. Our priestesses take vows of poverty, and I highly doubt that centuries-old tradition will have changed in the future.${prompt};
Then I bet someone beat her up and left her lying in a ditch!${prompt};
Perhaps the delectable scent of sausages enticed her?${prompt};
Well...maybe she found some delightful dress and is spending her hours at the clothiers?${prompt};
What if...what if someone accosted her!?${prompt};
D-do you think that's possible!?;
I must find her before it is too late!!!${prompt};
I should probably head off to find her, too.${prompt};
Maybe she made her way to Lower Jeuno?${prompt};
This whole incident has me quite concerned. Perhaps it is best if I join in the search.${prompt};
I'll see what I can find in Lower Jeuno.${prompt};
Hmm... It seems I can never find the perrrfect person. Although, I know that one day, somebody'll come along... Mwahaha!${prompt};
Oh! What do we have here!? Yes! You're just the perrrson I've been looking for!${prompt};
Mwahaha. Let me guess, you're a craftsman skilled in the art of ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking]. Am I rrright?${prompt};
No, don't answer that, my frrriend. I can tell just by looking at you!${prompt};
I have a favor to ask. Please, hear me out.${prompt};
Firrrst, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mewk Chorosap. I'm a member of the Inventors' Coalition in Adoulin.${prompt};
See, that's where you come in. I need your help with a new item I'm worrrking on. Mwahaha.${prompt};
Recently, I've been interrrested in crystal synthesis. In all of Vana'diel, the Middle Lands is known more than any other area for using crystal synthesis.${prompt};
Therefore, I took a trrrip to see how the process works.${prompt};
I'm so glad I came here! I can actually picture it now! A bright future where my technology and crystal synthesis are fused together in glorrrious harmony!${prompt};
Mwahahaha!${prompt};
Since you are a big part of this future, I want you to have this prrresent.${prompt};
You see, this is a kind of item to support and even enhance your efforts when it comes to synthesizing items.${prompt};
Of course, right now, it's just an orrrdinary shield.${prompt};
When synthesizing crystals, one's mind plays an imporrrtant part in visualizing the finished product.${prompt};
The power of the mind is also requirrred by this shield.${prompt};
So when craftsmen like yourself equip this shield, and try really hard to synthesize items over and over again, your blood, sweat, tears, and your very soul itself will be poured into the shield.${prompt};
I have coined the term “Craftsmanship” to describe the arrrt of imbuing the strength of one's mind into an object.${prompt};
Once your Craftsmanship reaches a cerrrtain level, you will be able to synthesize a crystal.${prompt};
You can then combine that crystal with special ingrrredients from the Inventors' Coalition to use on the shield I gave you.${prompt};
If it all goes according to plan, you'll end up with a brrrand-new shield.${prompt};
By crrrafting the shield over and over again, you can boost its ability to its maximum value.${prompt};
I have left the necessary ingredients with the ${choice: 0}[/Carpenters'/Smithing/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild, so please check with your guildmaster.${prompt};
However, I've asked them to not just give you the ingredients without worrrking for them.${prompt};
It wouldn't be interrresting if just anybody could make such a powerful thing. Mwahaha.${prompt};
I'll give you the shield, so what do you say? Are you interrrested in making it even more powerful? Of course, the road to its completion will be fraught with peril.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Once you have started to craft an escutcheon, your ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/blacksmithing/goldsmithing/weaving/leathcraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] skill will not reduce until the shield is completed or you cancel the process.;
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Leave it to me!;
I think I better pass.${prompt};
Really? Well, I suppose even if I did give it to somebody whose hearrrt wasn't in it, it wouldn't go very well. In that case, I'll take the shield back then.${prompt};
If you ever feel like showing me what you're trrruly made of, I'll be here waiting for you. Mwahaha.${prompt};
Mwahahaha. I knew you had it in you. I suppose I lit a fire within that crrraftsman's heart of yours.${prompt};
Now then. Show that shield to your guildmaster. The path forward will be rrrevealed to you.${prompt};
When you're finished, you'll need to receive a sign on the shield from your guildmaster that it's finished. Then brrring it back to me. I'm counting on you. Mwahaha.${prompt};
Why hello there, my ${choice: 0}[/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] expert. What is the prrroblem?${prompt};
What can I do for you?;
${selection-lines};
Never mind.;
I want to check the recipe.;
I want a catalyst.;
Tell me about these apparatuses.;
I want to try making the shield.;
I give up trying to make the shield.${prompt};
Mwahahaha. In that case, good luck to you, my frrriend.${prompt};
How's that shield coming? Finished yet?${prompt};
Good. Now let me have a look.${prompt};
Mwahaha. It's nice to see you're up for the challenge, my frrriend.${prompt};
In that case, I'll need to give you this.${prompt};
In rrregards to the other ingredients, I mentioned this before, but you'll need to speak with your guildmaster.${prompt};
At least, that's what I would say if you still didn't have that ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Dispose of it firrrst.${prompt};
Oh, what happened to give you a change of hearrrt? Are you sure you want to quit?${prompt};
${color-alt: 124}Note that reattempting will require you to abandon your current shield in progress.;
Really abandon your current shield?${prompt};
Do you really want to quit?;
${selection-lines};
On second thought, I'll stick with it.;
Yes, I've had enough.${prompt};
Mwahaha. That's what I like to hear. Keep up the good worrrk.${prompt};
Well, that is most unforrrtunate.${prompt};
That shield will do you no good, so be surrre to get rid of it.${prompt};
Mwahaha. I've been waiting for this. Let's see what you've brrrought me.${prompt};
It must've been hard when you firrrst started using this shield. It is difficult to get your spirit in tune with the crystal.${prompt};
Hmm...${prompt};
Yes, I imagined as much, but was hoping it'd turn out better.${prompt};
This is nowhere near the level I was expecting to see.${prompt};
I suppose a single upgrrrade is only enough to bring it this far. Although, there is no denying that it has gained some ability.${prompt};
Mwahaha. Can I have a little more time? It looks like I need to rrrethink the design a bit.${prompt};
Here, take this shield. And I forrrbid you from losing it.${prompt};
Once the prrreparations are complete, you'll need to perform the next upgrade. I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.${prompt};
(Hmm... Maybe mythril alone makes the spiritual link too weak? In that case, I'll need a differrrent metal. What could I use instead...)${prompt};
Hm? Mwahaha. I see you are eager to get starrrted. I need just a little more time.${prompt};
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. My prrreparations are complete. Mwahaha.${prompt};
I'm going to get it rrready for the upgrade, so can I borrow the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for a moment?${prompt};
Thank you. Okay, this won't take very long, so just wait a little longer.${prompt};
There. That should do the trrrick.${prompt};
Take this and trrry the synthesis again multiple times.${prompt};
Once your spirit has been sufficiently imbued into the shield, you can try crrrafting the shield again.${prompt};
The ingrrredients have been left with your guild, so speak to your guildmaster for more information.${prompt};
Simply show this shield to your parrrticular guildmaster and they'll know what to do.${prompt};
I'm interrrested to see what this shield can become. Yes, very interested indeed. Mwahaha.${prompt};
Mwahaha... I've been anxiously awaiting your rrreturn. So, how did it turn out?${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
It falls within the rrrange I was expecting, based on the results of our previous attempt.${prompt};
Splendid. I think you'll rrreally see an improvement with the next upgrade!${prompt};
Mwahaha. I'll prrrepare the next ingredient for the Inventors' Coalition.${prompt};
Be sure to make the next upgrade once the preparations are rrready. Mwahaha.${prompt};
(Hmm... If I could use that sheet, it could serve as a kind of antennae... The problem is the weight... Maybe next time, I'll...)${prompt};
Mwahaha. What can I do for you, my frrriend?${prompt};
Hmm... There's something wrrrong with this shield. I don't think it's capable of properly channelling your spirit.${prompt};
Although, it's still perrrfectly repairable, if you so desire.${prompt};
However, know that repairing the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will reset the escutcheon's progress to when you first received the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Do you want to repair the shield?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
No thanks.${prompt};
Okay, I'll make the rrrepairs. Wait just a moment.${prompt};
That should do it.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You must complete the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} to further enhance your shield.;
Sorry to keep you waiting. The prrreparations are finally complete.${prompt};
Hm? Is there something you'd like to ask me, frrriend?${prompt};
There appears to be interference with the synchronicity of the crystal. Yes, it seems that it is that rrrather annoying factor once again.${prompt};
It would appear that parrrticular factor is hounding us once again...${prompt};
However, there's no need to let it get us down. I've learrrned a way to mitigate its effects. Mwahaha.${prompt};
Crafting under cerrrtain conditions enables you to boost Craftsmanship more than usual, yes?${prompt};
When you take advantage of that situation, the factor is trrriggered, making your life more difficult.${prompt};
However, if you don't utilize this parrrticular condition, the effect of the factor grows stronger and stronger, meaning you should try to use it as much as possible.${prompt};
Were you able to comprrrehend all that? At any rate, simply show this shield to your guildmaster like before.${prompt};
Actually, I can't have you bothering your guildmaster all the time, so I'll explain part of the prrrocess here.${prompt};
First, you're going to need the rrrecipe.${prompt};
Required craft: ${choice: 6}[Fishing/Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] ${choice: 1}[ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] ${choice: 2}[ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] ${choice: 3}[ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking];
Required crystal: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 4[2]};
Required items...${prompt};
${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]};
${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 1[2]};
${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 2[2]};
${number: 7} ${item-given-plurality: 7[2], 3[2]}${prompt};
${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]};
${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 1[2]};
${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 2[2]}${prompt};
${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]};
${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 1[2]}${prompt};
${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]}${prompt};
That's all of them. I hope you wrote that down?${prompt};
Next, I'll go over how to obtain the necessary materials. I've hearrrd there are a total of three.${prompt};
Firrrst, you'll need the old standby, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Like usual, you'rrre going to have to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to 100% and show it to your guildmaster.${prompt};
Although, this may have been the most difficult thing to incrrrease the Craftsmanship for. Remember, crafting various kinds of items is the secret to success.${prompt};
Next, we have the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}. These too are exactly like you experrrienced before.${prompt};
Was it a crafting set? Make your deliveries and then you can use the points earned to trrrade for the item.${prompt};
After that, the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} come next. Hmm... I rrrecommend you check with your guildmaster on these two.${prompt};
That's all I have to say on the matter.${prompt};
Mwahaha! It seems the shield is nearly finished. Don't forrrget to have your guildmaster mark the shield after it's been upgraded.${prompt};
Mwahaha. So, how did it turn out? Allow me to take a closer look at your prrrize.${prompt};
Hmm... This is...${prompt};
Mwahahaha!${prompt};
Perrrfect!${prompt};
This is exactly the rrresult I was hoping for!${prompt};
Oh, please forrrgive me. I got a little carried away after seeing things turn out just as I anticipated. Mwahaha.${prompt};
I'm finding it harrrd to contain my excitement. This means the next upgrade will be the one. Mwahahaha!${prompt};
I'll get on the Inventors' Coalition to begin making the next set of preparations rrright away. I hope you're as excited as I am.${prompt};
(Hmm... The ultimate synchronicity... Now, to prepare the craftsman's symbol possessed by the guild...)${prompt};
Oh, my. I even told you to write the recipe down, too. Try to rrremember it this time.${prompt};
Mwahaha. Are you okay? Keep up the good work out there, my frrriend.${prompt};
Ahh, I see you've made it to the final stage at last.${prompt};
Now then, let's get starrrted, shall we? Let me see your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Thank you. I am extremely grrrateful for all of your hard work up to now.${prompt};
Now then, let's rrreview the necessary materials for the procedure.${prompt};
First, there's the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
These two items can be exchanged for crafter points at your guild.${prompt};
You'll need two ${item-plural: 2[2]} and one ${item-singular: 3[2]} to prrroceed.${prompt};
Next up is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}. You already know how it works. Although this time arrround, it can't simply be used as is.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} is the physical manifestation of a crrraftsman's heart and soul. Although it powers the final upgrade, you will need to activate it first.${prompt};
Once you obtain it, bring it to me. I'll tell you what you need to perrrform the activation.${prompt};
By the way, do you rrremember how to obtain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
You'll need the help of your guildmaster after rrraising the shield's Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};
That rrreminds me... I've managed to eliminate the rather unfortunate factor that previously plagued this shield!${prompt};
This will free you from those rather rrridiculous failures that you experienced before.${prompt};
And so our explanation ends here!${prompt};
Listen carefully. Once you obtain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, bring it to me rrright away.${prompt};
Well, good luck to you out there. I'll be anxiously awaiting your rrreturn.${prompt};
Ahh, I see you managed to obtain the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Excellent work, my frrriend.${prompt};
Now, it's time to explain how to perrrform the activation.${prompt};
In order to activate the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you must firrrst imbue it with your craftsman's spirit to previously unimaginable levels.${prompt};
Using the regular methods, you'd need to craft with it several million times, but that isn't very rrrealistic, now is it?${prompt};
That is why I've crrreated a special device to help assist with the crafting process.${prompt};
Using this “synthesis focuser” during your crafting sessions will help boost your spirit and imbue it within your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You just need to simply flip the switch and begin crafting, although some prrreparations are necessary.${prompt};
You'll need to place the ${item-singular: 0[2]} inside the synthesis focuser, along with the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst needed for the crafting process.${prompt};
For the crystal, please note that you cannot use the high-quality crystals or analysis crystals used for the engraving prrrocess.${prompt};
I'm going to place the ${item-singular: 0[2]} within the synthesis focuser for now.${prompt};
Once the materials are set, you can begin the crafting process.${prompt};
If everything goes as planned, it will infuse your ${item-singular: 0[2]} with a large amount of spirit. Once a sufficient amount has been trrransferred, it will activate the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Did you manage to comprrrehend all that? If so, then I shall continue...${prompt};
With this parrrticular kind of crafting, you're also able to form “links” while crafting!${prompt};
I like to call this type of link a “craftchain”. I know... I know... It's nothing fancy. Mwahaha.${prompt};
You alrrready know about the skillchains that you use in battle. This is kind of like that.${prompt};
The skillchain is triggered when you select the appropriate weapon skills with the proper timing, right?${prompt};
A craftchain is triggered when you use the proper crafting sphere and catalyst, also with the proper timing.${prompt};
Once the craftchain is triggered, it will boost your spirit by an even greater amount. You really want to use them if at all possible.${prompt};
Now, allow me to explain about the crafting spheres that I mentioned prrreviously.${prompt};
Crafting spheres are a type of material that are intricately linked with crystals and craftchains.${prompt};
This'll prrrobably go faster if I just show you one.${prompt};
This is what we call ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
And since Liquefaction includes a fire elemental, you will need to use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Be sure to keep one thing in mind. If you use a crystal that doesn't match the element, the synthesis is guaranteed to fail.${prompt};
There are 14 types of crafting sphere in all, the same number as the skillchains, with the exception of the Ultimate Skillchains of courrrse.${prompt};
However, you will need to learrrn the linking procedure for yourself.${prompt};
Now I will explain about the other material in the prrrocess...the catalyst.${prompt};
The catalyst is a material that has a grrreat effect on the success of your craftchain.${prompt};
You already know how skillchains have levels, rrright?${prompt};
Craftchains also have levels, and you will need to use a catalyst that matches the element of the crafting sphere.${prompt};
I have here an example of a catalyst. It comes from the Inventors' Coalition's verrry own MC-I-SR0 series!${prompt};
The linking process has thrrree levels, just like with skillchains. Depending on the crafting sphere you use, the catalyst will be selected automatically.${prompt};
Now I'd like to explain crafting failures in a bit more detail.${prompt};
If your combination of crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst are incorrect, the synthesis is guarrranteed to fail.${prompt};
And if it fails, you will lose the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst you used.${prompt};
Additionally, you will also lose some of the spirit stored within your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That will mean much of your hard work will be for naught, so be especially carrreful when selecting your materials.${prompt};
I rrrealize this explanation is dragging on a bit, but how's it going? Try to hang in there for just a little bit longer.${prompt};
Now I want to explain how to obtain the materials you'll rrrequire.${prompt};
You can get the MC-I-SR0 series catalyst from me, for the rrright price of course...${prompt};
The cost of manufacturing is rather high for this particular catalyst, so I got an earful from the coalition's accountant after I made it in bulk.${prompt};
If I don't turn a profit, it will adversely affect our rrresearch budget... So, sorry about that. I hope you understand.${prompt};
The crafting spheres are a somewhat unique item. You can obtain them by using a special technique that brrreaks down certain items into their individual components.${prompt};
You'll need to learn the technique before you can prrroceed. This should be everything you need to master it.${prompt};
Mwahaha. You can have this one frrree of charge.${prompt};
Now, about the item to be used as a base for the technique...${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 4[2]} and the ${item-singular: 5[2]}...${prompt};
You should be able to use the ${item-singular: 4[2]} with the ${item-singular: 6[2]}, and the ${item-singular: 5[2]} with the ${item-singular: 7[2]} for the prrrocedure.${prompt};
I believe there are more items out there that can be used. The exact number is unknown, but just consider finding them yet another part of the challenge.${prompt};
You can obtain information from other adventurers, or just keep experrrimenting until you find the answers for yourself.${prompt};
However, just be careful that you don't lose any valuable items in the process, even if it is in the name of prrrogress.${prompt};
I have a feeling that the items used to create the spheres contain some common factors. Of course, I have no evidence to back it up...${prompt};
That concludes my explanation. I imagine crrreating the spheres will keep you busy for some time to come. Good luck.${prompt};
Ahh... So this is the one I've heard so much aboutaru...${prompt};
Oh, how long have you been here?${prompt};
I justaru arrived.${prompt};
Mwahaha. Yes, I suppose so.${prompt};
Although, I was not expecting you to be the one to brrring me the synthesis focuser.${prompt};
I have my reasons-weasons. It needed a few adjustments before delivery. I know you aren't very good at that sort of thing.${prompt};
Yes, I suppose you're rrright about that. I am much better at seeing the bigger picture.${prompt};
By the way, were you able to properly explain the instructions to your guestaru?${prompt};
Of course I was.${prompt};
Really? You often tend to leave out rather important details-wetails, so I'm sure you understand my concern.${prompt};
E-enough about that alrrready. If you just got here, does that mean you were in Mhaura?${prompt};
Mhaura... I hear it's quite a bustling place, so I have some interestaru in it, but as long as she's there, I think I'll pass.${prompt};
Besides, I had some minor business to attend to. I paid a visitaru to each of the three countries in the Middle Lands.${prompt};
Of course, I made a pointaru to bring back some souvenirs for everybody in the coalition!${prompt};
Look! I purchased-wurchased ${article} ${item-article: 10[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 11[2]}, along with ${article} ${item-article: 12[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 13[2]}.${prompt};
There's ${article} ${item-article: 14[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 15[2]}... What's this thing again? I forgotaru...${prompt};
Oh yes... This is a little-wittle trinket I picked up along the way. It's for you, Mewk.${prompt};
...${prompt};
There's also ${article} ${item-article: 16[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 17[2]}...${prompt};
And then... Oh!${prompt};
I had better get going or else I won't make it in time to prepare for the nextaru investigation!${prompt};
Sorry that I'm so busy rightaru now.${prompt};
Well then, I'll waitaru until I hear from you again!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 15[2]}... I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do with this prrresent...${prompt};
Hm? There's something wrrritten on the back.${prompt};
What's this!? You've completed the activation!${prompt};
Yes, everything looks perrrfect. The activation is complete. You did it!${prompt};
Mwahaha... Would you like to go over the rrrecipe?${prompt};
I'd like to check the materials before you begin the synthesis, so would you mind showing them to me firrrst?${prompt};
Mwahaha. Now then, let's review the rrrecipe, shall we?${prompt};
Mwahaha. Impressive. Are you ready to perrrform the synthesis now?${prompt};
...;
...;
Hm? What's the matter? Is something wrrrong?${prompt};
What's that? You're trrrying to tell me the synthesis won't start!?${prompt};
I don't get it... What could've gone wrrrong...${prompt};
I wonder if the rrrecipe was mistaken... I don't see how though...${prompt};
Perrrhaps you did not sufficiently activate the object? No, that can't be it!${prompt};
Wait! That rrreminds me...${prompt};
I'm sorry. There's one more thing you rrrequire. It should be with your guildmaster.${prompt};
Do you think you could bring it here for me?${prompt};
(Thanks, Mikolulu. I completely forrrgot about that note.)${prompt};
(That note... If I had thrown it carrrelessly away without noticing, I wonder what I would have done...)${prompt};
I'm sorry. My rrrequest was rather pointless. The thing I asked of you is already here.${prompt};
Here you go. Mwahaha. It's a rrrather exceptional emblem.${prompt};
Allow me to go over the rrrecipe once more.${prompt};
Do you have all of the materials? If so, perrrform the synthesis and show me the completed shield.${prompt};
So, this is what all of the commotion is about...${prompt};
This is what I have spent all this time purrrsuing...${prompt};
It's...${prompt};
It's completed at last!${prompt};
Mwahaha. I'm sorry to have frrrightened you. However, I was simply unable to contain my excitement. Mwahahaha!${prompt};
Well, looks like I'll be having to share that with the guildmaster!${prompt};
Yes... Go and show that shield to your guildmaster.${prompt};
Mwahaha. Welcome back. I imagine your guildmaster was rrrather pleased, no?${prompt};
That rrreminds me... I don't think I ever thanked you properly.${prompt};
With this project, I started out looking for a way to rrrevolutionize the manufacturing process, but I never would've succeeded without your assistance.${prompt};
Thank you for helping me all this time. And congrrratulations on finally completing the escutcheon.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
There are some conditions for losing your “spirit.”${prompt};
The Synthesis Focuser II will become unstable if certain things are done repeatedly.${prompt};
Those “certain things” are continuing to use the same crystal and continuing to do the same chain.${prompt};
If it remains unstable for too long, the Synthesis Focuser II may explode if or when the synthesis fails, meaning that you are more likely to lose some of your spirit.${prompt};
Stability is restored over time or by increasing the level of your chain.${prompt};
An explosion will also restore stability to the focuser, although I highly recommend you do not take this route.${prompt};
The Stability gauge displays the focuser's current stability.${prompt};
Mwahaha! Very well. Which do you prrrefer?${prompt};

Hey, you're the one that was with Maat...${prompt};

The Destiny Destroyers.;
Odin's servant.;
A demon.${prompt};
Whoa! You've gotta tell us all about it!${prompt};
Whoa! You've gotta tell us all about it!${prompt};
Oh, really!? W-would you mind telling us more!?${prompt};
Haha! So those Goblins are...${prompt};
...trying to find out more about the “World Eater Egg”.${prompt};
We'd be happy to tell ya what we know.${prompt};
Hehehe...;
I can share what I learned from one of my orb suppliers...${prompt};
First of all, the situation in Valhalla is exactly what you and the Goblins think it is.${prompt};
The “World Eater Egg” that was hidden somewhere in Valhalla was broken open.;
Or at least that's what I heard.${prompt};
I thought Odin would do something about it, but things didn't quite go as expected.${prompt};
If you want to know more, you should speak with the new demon known as Duke Alloces.${prompt};
I believe he shows up from time to time at Elijah's in Upper Jeuno.${prompt};
Although he hasn't been there lately.;
Maybe he got tired of Elijah's sarcastic personality--he wouldn't be the first.${prompt};
Also, I imagine you're curious about how Maat managed to split open the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt};
That “World Eater Egg” was sealed away in Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.${prompt};
The one who sealed it away...I believe he goes by the name of Delkfutt.${prompt};
According to him, the shell already had a crack in it.${prompt};
Apparently, someone in San d'Oria put a crack in the egg roughly twenty years ago.${prompt};
Delkfutt was mumbling about how people always stick their noses where they don't belong.${prompt};
"Well, I suppose they're better than the Gigas; they hid the fact that the egg had been stolen.${prompt}";
That's true.;
They probably should've reported it to Delkfutt. You don't want to make a demon angry.${prompt};
Although, we were lucky this time.;
That egg didn't end up doing too much harm.${prompt};
Yeah, about that, I heard somethin' that was a little worrisome.;
Maybe it was because it was Maat...${prompt};
Never mind. You should hurry home and eat so you can get some rest.${prompt};
If you want to know what happened twenty years ago, you'd need to go back in time.${prompt};
If you want more details about what happened twenty years ago, you'd need to go back in time.${prompt};
The knights today may not know anything, but the knights that lived at the time might.${prompt};
Welcome to the ammunition retrieval service.${prompt};
I'm pleased to announce that we've come up with a way for you to retrieve specific ammunition storage items that you may have previously lost--but one time only!${prompt};
If you want to retrieve one of said items, all you need to do is trade me the corresponding weapon.${prompt};
Please keep in mind that this is a one-time-only service per weapon. There will be no second retrieval process available.${prompt};
Please note that this system is specific to the ammunition storage items, and you will not be able to retrieve a discarded weapon itself.${prompt};
Any questions?;

If you wish to retrieve your ${item-singular: 8[2]}, trade me your ${item-singular: 9[2]}.${prompt};
Before I forget, I would like to remind you that you have the Recycle Bin feature.${prompt};
Do you know this feature?;
${selection-lines};
The one in the Items menu?;
The one on my desktop?;
No clue.${prompt};
That's right. Make sure to check there if you accidentally discard something you didn't mean to.${prompt};
I suppose an explanation is in order.${prompt};
If you accidentally discard something you didn't mean to, stay calm and open up the Items submenu from the main menu.${prompt};
At the top right is an entry for the Recycle Bin. You can retrieve your accidentally discarded item from there.${prompt};
Up to ten items you have discarded while in your current area are stored in the bin.${prompt};
If you throw away 11 or more items, the oldest ones are deleted first. The bin is also emptied when you log out or change areas.${prompt};
If you make a mistake, don't panic. Check the bin first!${prompt};
Hopefully this will help you avoid any accidents in the future!${prompt};
You want to retrieve the item associated with this weapon? Let me take a look.${prompt};
Hmm. The item associated with this weapon is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
But you've already retrieved the item once before, so I cannot help you again.${prompt};
Hang on...I think you've got that item located in a storage system somewhere. Take a good look.${prompt};
I'm sorry. My services don't apply to that item.${prompt};
This will be your one and only retrieval of your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Are you sure?${prompt};
