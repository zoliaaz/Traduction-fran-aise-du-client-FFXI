What brings you here?;
This is the Halvung staging point. From here we keep close surveillance on lands that are of strategic importance to the Imperial Army.${prompt};
This is not the sort of place for common folk like you.${prompt};
What brings you here?;
This is the Halvung staging point. From here we keep close surveillance on lands that are of strategic--${prompt};
Eh?;
And whose messenger would you be?${prompt};
Show him your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
I am no one's messenger.${prompt};
You show the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Waudeen's staunch expression begins to soften!;
You brought ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} for me?;
Well, why didn't you say so sooner?${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was created from the oil of a berry that can only be found in the nation of Zhwa, to the far south. It takes days to extract the oil, and the fragrance it gives off is simply indescribable.${prompt};
Here, we are so used to the stench of fighting and pain...;
This oil will be indispensable if I ever should have the fortune to meet with the Empress again.${prompt};
Oh, I must thank you for bringing this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me!${prompt};
Will a bit of information do?${prompt};
Allow me to explain about the glowing blue device behind you.${prompt};
That is a “runic portal.”;
It has the power to carry you to a distant location.${prompt};
I am not precisely sure how it works, but it is one of the many curious magical creations of the alchemists in the royal court.${prompt};
All speculation aside, however, the device is quite convenient. You should give it a try.${prompt};
You are certain to be amazed when you arrive in Al Zahbi in the blink of an eye!${prompt};
In addition, you will be able to use the device from Al Zahbi after traveling once from here.${prompt};
I highly advise making use of it when you have urgent business here at the Halvung staging point.${prompt};
Is that so? My senses must be dulling with age.;
In any case, you are trespassing on Imperial territory. Leave immediately.${prompt};
If you ever should have urgent business with me, remember that you can return instantly using the runic portal.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s mercenary badge flashes.;
Is that a mercenary badge from Salaheem's Sentinels you have there? So you have become a mercenary, am I correct?${prompt};
I have heard that Salaheem's Sentinels do not treat their employees very kindly. I will not give any orders, but I suggest that you not let your life go to waste.${prompt};
You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};

What!?;
You loved that ${item-singular: 0[2]}!;
Where did you lose it?${prompt};
(The crevasse...so deep...;

In the crevasse, huh...?;
That thing is really deep.;
I don't think you'll be seeing it again.${prompt};

What do you want?;
Hm? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Hey, Zurt!;
Look at this! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
(A pickaxe...?;
This is a little-person tool...)${prompt};
(<Sigh>...;
You are very kind. But I am a Troll.;
I cannot use little-person tools.)${prompt};
Oh, that's right. This ${item-singular: 0[2]} would be way too small for you. That's a real shame.${prompt};
(I break boulders.;
This will snap like a twig.;
Trolls need big-person tools.)${prompt};
So you wanna break boulders, huh?;
You'll be needing something a little more sturdy than ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, then...;
Hmmm...${prompt};
(<Sigh>...;
I'll never see my pick again...)${prompt};
You again?;
Zurt's not up for company right now.;
Why don't you just leave the poor Troll alone...${prompt};
(Wait. What is that?;
Let me see.)${prompt};
(Hmmm.;
Still very little, but...;
It looks strong. Strong enough for a Troll.;
Maybe strong enough to break Zhayolm rock...)${prompt};
Really?;
You think you can use that ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
(Maybe...)${prompt};
Hey, you.;
You gonna give that thing to my buddy Zurt here?${prompt};
Give Zurtermor the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Anything to cheer him up...sheesh.;
No! It's mine!${prompt};
What kinda jerk are you?;
You get Zurt all excited, then you throw his heart into the crevasse with his pick?${prompt};
(You are kind, little-person.;
I am...moved...)${prompt};
Yeah, what a nice ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady].${prompt};
(My friends...all hate little-persons.;
Hate the Empire. Fight and war with them.;
But you. You are different.)${prompt};
I don't know too many of your type of people, but you seem to be one of the good ones.${prompt};
(Here. A map for the little-person.)${prompt};
You're gonna give the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to this ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]? Wow, you really made Zurt happy...${prompt};
(You have already.;
Then you not need it.;
Very dangerous without map.)${prompt};
(My friends. Hate little-persons. Hate the Empire.;
Trolls were driven away. No room for big-persons.)${prompt};
(Use the map. You won't be lost in Zhayolm.;
Watch out for my friends. They don't know you are a kind little-person.)${prompt};
Yeah, that map oughta keep you from getting too lost in Zhayolm.${prompt};
Just watch out for those friends of Zurt's. They'll smash you just as soon as look at you.${prompt};
(I can dig again. Use this ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
I will find ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...)${prompt};
Hey! Take it easy!;
Don't go dropping stuff down that crevasse again!;

I was beginning to think...<pant, pant>...you'd never show up.;
I...<wheeze>...taught myself three new songs just in the time I spent waiting for you!${prompt};
Hm? What's this now?${prompt};
Shhh! Someone's headed this way!;
Take cover!${prompt};
Halt, I say! Who goes there!?${prompt};
Drat! We've lost him...${prompt};
Who could that have been?;
That distinctive crimson garb...could it have been the Flameserpent General?${prompt};
Hullo, what have we here?${prompt};
Is this...a flower petal?;
What a curious present from our mysterious visitor.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Fari-Wari picked up ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
And the plot thickens!;
No dilly-dallying, my loyal attendant. The chase is on!${prompt};
Have we lost the trail?;
I could have sworn he came this way...${prompt};
Perhaps mine eyes deceived me, and 'twas not General Gadalar after all?;
After all, carrying a bouquet of flowers would be rather uncharacteristic of--${prompt};
Unless...could it truly be?;
Do the flames of passion burn in the Flameserpent General's heart?;
A twilight tryst? A romantic rendezvous? To dream, perchance to love?${prompt};
What the--?${prompt};
Well, well.;
Look what the coeurl dragged in.${prompt};
G-general Gadalar! Milord, you've got it all wrong!;
We're here from the Vana'diel Tribune, you see, ah--;
Yes! We're researching an article on “Favorite Vacation Spots of the Serpent Generals,” and we just--${prompt};
Still your tongue, whelp!${prompt};
You've got some nerve, I'll grant you that.;
Thinking you can meddle with the Flameserpent General and escape unsinged...;
Milord, have mercy!;
I assure you, Fari-Wari the Prudent wanted no part of this!;
It was my dolt of an attendant here, I swear! ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]--${prompt};
No, not again! I beg of you!;
Anything but--${prompt};
Yeeeeee-owwwwwwwww!!!;
Hmph.${prompt};
Ouchy-wouchy, that stings!;
Are you alive there, ${name-player}?${prompt};
${color-alt: 141}Fari-Wari used ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
The outrage! The unmitigated gall of that man!${prompt};
Just look at these scorch marks on my choral slippers!;
I swear, he'll pay for--hm?${prompt};
Good heavens! What's happened here?;
Quickly, ${name-player}, that man needs our help!${prompt};
Are these ashes?;
It's as if the poor soul was roasted by dragonfire...${prompt};
There, there, my good man! Fari-Wari has come to your aid!;
Just sit up and take a deep--ye gads!;
H-he's...he's not breathing!${prompt};
Halt! Not another step!;
Well, well...what have we here?;
We had word of two dubious prowlers headed for Zazalda Island...and look what we've found.${prompt};
What in blazes happened here!?;
Check that man for vital signs! Now!${prompt};
...${prompt};
<Ahem>... Well, you fellows seem to have the situation under control, so we'll just be on our way. Come along, ${name-player}!;
Hold it right there!;
You'll be accompanying us back to the capital...willingly or otherwise.${prompt};
How many times do I have to tell you!? We're innocent!${prompt};
We did nothing! We saw nothing!;
When we awoke from our Firaga-induced slumber, the man was already dead!${prompt};
Fari-Wari, was it not?;
Rest assured that we are by no means assuming that your claims are mendacious.${prompt};
That man was a soldier of our most elite border patrol.;
He would not easily fall to an undersized bard and his run-of-the-mill mercenary.${prompt};
Exactly!;
My gentle attendant and I would not--nay, could not--harm even a fly!;
So if you don't mind, we'll be taking our leav--${prompt};
Be that as it may, you were found at the scene of a most heinous crime.;
Surely you understand that it would be remiss for us to release you without exercising...due caution.${prompt};
There is the distinct possibility, for example, that you were hatching some devious plot against Her Imperial Majesty...${prompt};
Us?;
Surely you jest!${prompt};
Hmmm...very well, then. If you are so eager to prove your innocence, then tell me.;
What were you doing at Mount Zhayolm?${prompt};
If there is a legitimate reason that the two of you were lying incapacitated at the scene of a murder, then let us hear it.;
A simple question, is it not?;
Well? Out with it!${prompt};
(A fine mess we've gotten ourselves into, ${name-player}.;
What to do? Have we no choice but to betray General Gadalar's trust?)${prompt};
Spill the beans on Gadalar?;
${selection-lines};
Never.;
We have no choice.${prompt};
(Are you certain, ${name-player}?;
Surely you remember Shayadar's words? General Najelith and General Mihli would never forgive us!)${prompt};
(But if you absolutely insist, then--no, I can't do it! I won't!;
I'll not be a part of this, you two-timing turncoat!)${prompt};
(<Sniff>... Indeed, ${name-player}. I knew my attendant was a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of honor!;
Worry not, for my lips too are sealed!)${prompt};
(This virtuous bard would sooner cut out his own tongue than betray the trust of a friend!;
No, Fari-Wari the Eloquent will not go down as a stool pigeon!)${prompt};
What is this furtive muttering?;
Your hesitancy to answer betrays your misdeeds!${prompt};
No! Never!;
We've done nothing! We saw nothing!${prompt};
<Ahem>... Pray allow me to explain, my lordship.;
My attendant and I live simple lives, far from the weighty affairs of mighty warriors such as yourself.${prompt};
It just so happens that we traveled to Mount Zhayolm in search of an isolated mountain hut suitable for a meditation retreat. 'Twas all ${name-player}'s idea.${prompt};
A meditation retreat?;
Mount Zhayolm is an active volcano...and a haven for the most vicious Trolls!${prompt};
Obviously! I told my fool attendant here the very same.;
Yet ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] a stubborn one, you see...${prompt};
But I digress.;
One of the brutes snuck up behind us, clonked our heads with a slab of rock, and that was the end of it!;
That'll teach you to plan these expeditions more carefully, ${name-player}!${prompt};
<Ahem>... Master Fari-Wari.;
Allow me to offer some friendly advice.;
If you and your companion value your lives, you will tell us the truth.${prompt};
<Gulp>!${prompt};
(You've really dug us into a hole now, ${name-player}!;
Whatever shall we do?)${prompt};
(But if you absolutely insist, then--no, I can't do it! I won't!;
I'll not be a part of this, you two-timing turncoat!)${prompt};
I-I swear!;
I've spoken nothing but the truth, so help me Goddess!${prompt};
I see.;
Then so be it.${prompt};
Let the half-pint troubadour and his mangy companion go free!;
We'll begin the investigation anew. That's an order!${prompt};
S-sir!?;
I mean...sir, yes sir!${prompt};
Curses...I figured a little scare at swordpoint would be enough to get those two to break.${prompt};
Then if you have no objection, sir, I shall proceed as planned...${prompt};
As you wish. If you feel compelled to involve yourself, then let it be so.;
Just ensure that your overzealousness is not your downfall.${prompt};
Of course, sir.${prompt};
Whew... That was a bit too close for comfort!${prompt};
Nothing like being threatened at swordpoint to get the blood flowing.;
It could easily have been worse, though.;
Be grateful that you had the glib tongue of Fari-Wari the Eloquent on your side!${prompt};
In any event, we must inform Shayadar of this most troubling development.${prompt};
Though we may not have conclusive evidence, no doubt he'll be keen to see this ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
With any luck, it will give us a lead upon which to continue the search!${prompt};
Now, where did I put it...?;
Was it this pocket? No, this one...?${prompt};
How careless of me! I must have dropped it along the way!;
Wherever could it--${prompt};
Of course! It must have fallen out when we were captured by the Immortals!;
They roughed us up quite vigorously, after all.${prompt};
Well, we can't return to Shayadar empty-handed now, can we?;
It looks like you'll just have to run back and get it.;
Me? I can't join you this time, I'm afraid.${prompt};
After all, someone has to set up an appointment with Shayadar, no?;
Besides, you're the one with the sharp eyes of a hawk and swift legs of a sabotender. Hurry back now, okay?${prompt};
Who goes there!?${prompt};
What business have you here, stranger?${prompt};
Wait, that scent.;
Could it be...?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt};
So it was you the other day...${prompt};
Not the wisest one, are you?;
To knowingly walk into a trap, just to save some general of a foreign army. A man you barely even know.${prompt};
Or perhaps...${prompt};
Perhaps you and he are not so different, after all.${prompt};
Very well.;
As a reward for your bravery, I shall tell you my tale.${prompt};
I am Shayeeha, formerly of the Inexorables--a regiment of warriors so fierce and so relentless that the very mention of our name was enough to strike terror into the hearts of every beastman alive.${prompt};
A band once led by a man named Gadalar!${prompt};
I remember that fateful day as if it were yesterday.;
The air was dank and stifling, not unlike today.${prompt};
Under the flawless direction of Commander Gadalar, we had penetrated deep into the enemy ranks in the course of mere days.${prompt};
I commanded my own squadron as we cut swaths through the opposition, slaying countless beastmen with nary a casualty of which to speak.;
Morale was at an all-time high. Everything was going according to plan...${prompt};
And yet, I could not shake the ill presage I felt that night.;
The air itself weighed heavily upon my soul.${prompt};
'Twas not long before the omen became reality, in the form of a sharp twang cutting through the silence...and an arrow lodged deep in my thigh.${prompt};
It began in an instant...and would end just as quickly.${prompt};
My squad, which had been plotting an ambush, quickly became the prey.;
We were barely a hundred strong. The enemy numbered several times that as they fell upon us in droves.${prompt};
I would later find out why.${prompt};
It was a hostage--a young beastboy that I had set free the day before in a moment of misplaced mercy--that had alerted the enemy to our plans.${prompt};
Unable to advance or retreat, I could only stand agape as my loyal men were slaughtered like pigs...${prompt};
Damn! There's hordes of them!${prompt};
Captain Shayeeha...you can't fight with those wounds!;
We'll draw their fire. Pray make your escape!${prompt};
Unnngh...'tis no use.;
My leg...I can hardly feel it.${prompt};
Bah! Do you take your captain for a craven?;
Two legs or one, I can hold off this ragged flock of crows on my own!;
Save your own lives!${prompt};
Then at least allow us the honor of standing with you!;
If this is truly the end of the Inexorables, let us give these beastmen a battle they'll not soon forget!${prompt};
Fools! This is an order!;
Run! Run until your spindly legs snap off!${prompt};
S-sir...${prompt};
Or would you dishonor the memory of the Inexorables by disobeying your captain's final order?;
Run, I say!${prompt};
Sir...yes, sir.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Damn!${prompt};
<Hack>...<cough>...;
My Empress...if you truly are descended from the heavens...${prompt};
Please...I beg of you...see my comrades home.${prompt};
Commander Gadalar!?${prompt};
What brings you back here, into the heart of the fray?${prompt};
And I thought you were of better stock...${prompt};
W-what!?${prompt};
Look at your pathetic face!;
Have you forgotten what I taught you!?;
A leader of men shows no fear, no matter how great the danger!${prompt};
Enough! Sniveling cowards have no place in my army!;
You're relieved of duty! Now get out of my sight!${prompt};
Wh-what!?;
Here...on the field of battle?;
On whose authority--${prompt};
And who gave you the authority to die like a dog on my watch!?${prompt};
Shayeeha, listen to me.;
Surrender yourself to the enemy.;
Present me as your captive and they will grant you asylum.${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
What madness is this!?;
This is hardly the time for drollery--${prompt};
Hm? Have you forgotten?;
I always mean what I say.${prompt};
I am, after all, a warrior of some repute in these parts.;
A gift of the mighty Gadalar in shackles should be incentive enough for the crows to offer you a place in their army.${prompt};
Unthinkable!;
You ask me to sacrifice my commander to save my own worthless life!?${prompt};
Enough with your whimpering!${prompt};
Listen!;
This is the best chance--the only chance--for us both to survive!;
Or are you that eager to cast your life away?${prompt};
...As you wish, Commander.${prompt};
We shall try this charade.;
Just don't come crying to me for mercy when the crows come to peck your eyes out. Hah!${prompt};
Hah! Me, beg mercy from you!? Don't make me laugh!;
You take care not to wet yourself from fear.${prompt};
Me? Surely you jest.;
Besides, they say that unlike the Empire, the Far Eastern armies reward skill above lineage.;
The next time you see me, I may even be a general!${prompt};
Ha! High aspirations coming from a craven coward!;
The mighty Crow Warlord Shayeeha, eh!?${prompt};
Heh, not a bad ring to it.;
Do that, and I'll even offer a gift in your honor. How does ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} sound?${prompt};
The mighty Gadalar would deign to honor his former deputy with a flower?;
That would be a rare treat, indeed!${prompt};
(Damn! No more time for idle banter... They're closing ranks!)${prompt};
Traitorous scum! You would raise your blade against me!?;
Yeeeaaarrrggghhhhhh!!!${prompt};
!${prompt};
Hear me, honorable warriors of the East!;
I am Shayeeha Aphaloud, Captain of the Inexorables' Crimson Scorpion Brigade!${prompt};
I live only to see peace and unified rule brought to this war-torn realm!${prompt};
Grant me a place in your legion and I shall swear my life and honor to the banner of the East!${prompt};
Kyyyaaahahah!;
Listen to the blather of this barbarian dog!;
Do you think us fool enough to fall for your ruse, vile wretch?${prompt};
I swear upon my life!;
As proof of my honor, behold! I have captured the raging demon feared throughout your lands!;
I give you our army's most feared warrior...Commander Gadalar!${prompt};
Damn you! Double-crossing scoundrel!;
Vermin!!! What are you looking at!?;
I'll torch your mangy wings off!${prompt};
What...!? Could it be?;
Does the barbarian dog speak true...?${prompt};
...And that was the last I saw of General Gadalar.${prompt};
The reports were true--the Eastern army was generous to those who displayed loyalty and skill.;
My rise through the ranks was swift. In six months' time, I even held a minor seat on the war council.;
Our gambit had succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.${prompt};
Still, even after earning their trust, there was one piece of information none of my commanders would share.;
And so Gadalar's fate remained a secret to me...${prompt};
...Until this past day.;
I was entrusted with leading a sentry party on an intelligence mission here to the Capital.;
It was then that I saw him.${prompt};
Tales of the so-called Serpent Generals had reached us in the Far East, but never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that one of them was--${prompt};
Speak of the devil.${prompt};
And so it appears our friendly palaver must draw to a close.;
Being the sharp ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lady] that you are, no doubt you've already figured out my true intentions?${prompt};
Our “reconnaissance” of Al Zahbi is but a ruse.;
No, my true mission is far greater--to bring General Gadalar to fight along my side!${prompt};
……どうやら来たようだな。;
お前の相手はここで終わりだ。${prompt};
If you value your life...you'll stay out of our way.${prompt};
I thought there was something odd about that Yagudo scout party.${prompt};
I'd never known the crows to use the four-man penetration team.;
No, on the contrary...that was my preferred tactic.${prompt};
So my suspicions were true.;
It was you, Shayeeha.${prompt};
Glad to see you're still alive!;
Bwahahaha!${prompt};
無事なら良い。;
かつての同僚の生死を確認しただけだ。;
もう戻る。${prompt};
Likewise, Commander--no, General Gadalar!${prompt};
Call me whatever you like.;
They'll be serving me my discharge papers before long, no doubt.${prompt};
Just ask that adventurer over there.${prompt};
Just ask that mercenary over there.${prompt};
So the rumors are true.;
Commander Gadalar, listen to me!${prompt};
Bah, I think not!;
Or have you forgotten, Shayeeha? We fight under different banners now!;
If you mean to trade war stories, save it for when we've both hung up our blades.${prompt};
Commander Gadalar, how can you stomach this!?;
After all of your brilliant victories...your unwavering duty even in the face of captivity and torture...${prompt};
These armchair generals--who lack the spine to spend even a day on the front lines--have the gall to judge you!?;
You stand at the mercy of cowards!${prompt};
What honor could there possibly be in serving such a honorless nation?;
A general of your talents deserves better.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Our warlord knows firsthand of your prowess.;
Of the rending scythe and the flames that burn hotter than Ifrit.;
He would welcome you...as his vassal and bannerman.${prompt};
General Gadalar, I beseech you!;
Come with me!${prompt};
Take your rightful place in our army and we shall head to the battlefield as comrades once more!${prompt};
A tempting offer...;
I think I'll pass.${prompt};
But why...!?${prompt};
Hmmm?;
Maybe you should ask your friend over there...${prompt};
I'm disappointed in you, Shayeeha.;
I thought you would prove more...useful.${prompt};
Damn!${prompt};
Well, if it isn't General Malzaab. To what do I owe the pleasure?;
Decided to ditch the stuffy courtroom and hold the court-martial here instead?${prompt};
More or less, General Gadalar.;
More or less...${prompt};
For a group of crow spies to make it inside the palace walls, I knew that the traitor had to be someone high in the ranks.${prompt};
Hah!;
Now I guess we know just how high.${prompt};
Shayeeha, what are you waiting for!?;
Have you forgotten your orders?;
If he refused the offer, you were to kill him...immediately!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hah! So you take orders from this dishonorable cad?${prompt};
Yes, though I have no intention of killing you.;
So I will bring you with me as promised. Even if it must be by force...${prompt};
Hah! I see the years haven't softened the rocks in your head!${prompt};
You over there!;
What you're about to witness is a duel of honor between two warriors. Don't even think about getting in the way!${prompt};
En garde!${prompt};
...Damn!${prompt};
Heh, your skills have improved!${prompt};
Urghh...guhhh...${prompt};
As I expected, though, you're still no match for me.${prompt};
Tuck in your tailfeathers--it's back to the crow's nest with you.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I knew from the start...that you'd never come with me.${prompt};
At first, my plot was to turn your fellow Serpent Generals against you.;
My first target was the Skyserpent General...${prompt};
What's this you say?;
The Flameserpent General in league with the enemy? Inconceivable!${prompt};
'Tis true he might be a bit rough around the edges.;
But I have yet to meet a general more loyal to his men than Gadalar!${prompt};
He would not--could not--betray his men, not even were he offered a kingdom for the heinous deed!;
As his friend and comrade, this much I know.${prompt};
The response from each Serpent General was the same.;
“General Gadalar, a traitor!? Preposterous!”;
Even the mercenaries in town attested to your honor.${prompt};
And then, this ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]...;
Little more than a stranger, yet willing to risk ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] life rather than betray your trust!${prompt};
Urrrghhh!${prompt};
Shayeeha!${prompt};
I...I envy ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Commander Gadalar.${prompt};
When I repatriated to the East, I gained my life anew.;
I gained rank, and recognition. And yet...that day...${prompt};
I lost something...something far, far more important.${prompt};
Wh-what!? Curses!${prompt};
Enough! I tire of this charade!;
The court has rendered its verdict. Both of you are sentenced...to death!${prompt};
Bah! Run like the craven cur that you are!${prompt};
General Gadalar!${prompt};
Raubahn.${prompt};
We've uncovered strong evidence as to the identity of the traitor, and the Immortals have assumed control of the investigation.;
You can hand the woman over to us now.${prompt};
Heh. Sorry, Raubahn, but I have business with this one.${prompt};
Away with you!${prompt};
...What!?${prompt};
Commander Gadalar, the day will come for us to cross scythes again.;
Until then...${prompt};
Try not to get yourself killed! Hah!${prompt};
Damn!;
She's down below! After her!${prompt};
And you, Shayeeha...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...?${prompt};
I've had little use for this flower these days.;
Only as an offering at the graves of my fallen comrades...${prompt};
But not the two of us. We were never the type for teary farewells...;
Were we, Shayeeha!?${prompt};
Here, take them!;
To the success of a true warrior!;
You there.;
If you're expecting a flowery thank-you of your own, you can forget it.${prompt};
But I won't soon forget your efforts.${prompt};
Shayadar. You've come for me, eh?;
Worry not...my work here is done.;
I'll submit myself to the court.${prompt};
Wouldn't want poor Rughadjeen and Najelith to be sentenced to death in my place now, would we?;
Bwahahaha! Let's go!${prompt};
Yes, sir!;
(For your service to the Empire, and to General Gadalar, you have my deepest gratitude.;
Come visit me at the teahouse, that I might repay this debt in earnest.)${prompt};

${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you say? Bwahahaha!;
Someone's got a nose for retro junk, I see. Mayhap your uncle was a Moblin, no?${prompt};
Anyway, you can forget it.;
Those things aren't easy to make, and even if they were, why should Megomak do any favors for the likes of you?;
Now get out of here before I use you as troll feed!${prompt};
Show Megomak your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
We seem to have a misunderstanding.;
I said “get lost,” not “show me your junk collec--”${prompt};
...Wait just a Mobby minute!${prompt};
Do you have any idea what this is!?${prompt};
<Ahem>... Consider it your lucky day!;
Megomak the Magnificent, genius of geniuses, will deign to honor your request.${prompt};
...After you show due appreciation for my boundless generosity by employing your meager talents to fetch what I require, that is.${prompt};
${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}.;
That should do the trick.${prompt};
Hook me up with the goods, and I'll know that you're worthy of my talents.;
Get killed in the process, and that's one less adventurer distracting me from more...profitable endeavors.;
Either way, Megomak wins. Bwahahaha!${prompt};
You can tell whoever sent you that I'll be keepin' your little gift.;
Consider it a down payment.${prompt};
In return, you can have this shopping list.;
Here, catch!${prompt};
Now that was a sorry display. Doesn't bode well for your chances, I'd say.;
So long! I won't be expecting you back.${prompt};
The door's coarse, discolored surface gives off a pungent chemical odor...${prompt};
Well, look who's back. And in one piece, too!;
Color ol' Megomak surprised.${prompt};
Bah. A genius such as I has far more pressing pursuits, but a promise is a promise.${prompt};
Voila! Go on, admire the craftsmanship!;
No one makes ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} like Megomak, that's for certain.${prompt};
I don't know what you're going to use it for, and I don't wanna know.;
But remember this: as potent a charge as this baby can carry, it exhausts its energy just as quick.${prompt};
That means you can only use it once, so you'd better make it count.${prompt};
And it's all yours. Transaction complete!;
No replacements, no refunds.${prompt};
In other words, don't even think of running back to me if it blows up in your face.;
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some real work to do.${prompt};
(Don't fret, my dearest Khimmy... Daddy's on his way!);
Well, well, if it isn't the maundering mercenary.;
Let me guess...you find yourself needing the sort of goods that only I can provide.${prompt};
How did I know it? Once my customers discover Megomak quality, they're hooked for life.;
I have to call in the Trolls to keep them away! Bwahahaha!${prompt};
But not you. No, you're one of my...<ahem>...valued customers.${prompt};
So revel and rejoice!;
Megomak the Magnificent will fashion you ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} the likes of which you haven't seen...er, since the last time we did this.${prompt};
After you bring me the necessary materials, of course.;
You didn't lose my shopping list, did you?${prompt};
Hmmmmmmmmm? You have a problem with that?${prompt};
Why, you should consider yourself fortunate that one of my genius would even associate with a simple-minded sellsword such as yourself.${prompt};
Now be off with you. I have more pressing matters to attend to!${prompt};
(Just sit pretty, my pet! Daddy's on his way, and he's got fresh apkallu eggs for you today!)${prompt};
Oh drat, you're back.;
I was hoping you'd fall in a crater or something so I could have some peace and quiet for once.${prompt};
Ah, but it is the plight of the genius to suffer!;
Anyway, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Take it and get lost.${prompt};
And remember: no replacements, no refunds.${prompt};
Ask for instructions?;
${selection-lines};
None needed.;
Just in case...${prompt};
<Sigh>... You don't have much of a brain in that big head of yours, do you?${prompt};
Well, listen up: as potent a charge as this baby can carry, it exhausts its energy just as quick.${prompt};
That means you can only use it once, so you'd better make it count.${prompt};
Now, if you'll excuse me...${prompt};

How to participate.;

Stratum abyssite.;
Alignment.;
Atmacite.;
Periapt.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};

What do you want?${prompt};
I'll ask you again... What do you want with Megomak?${prompt};
Oh, you know about Falak?;
From what I hear, that's all anybody's talking about right now.${prompt};
Well, you did come bearing gifts, and I suppose I can give you the short version, but you're looking for details, right?${prompt};
In that case, there just so happens to be someone who knows much more about the subject than good old Megomak does.;
Maybe you should pay 'em a visit?${prompt};
My friend was born to a brave and heroic family, but found it tough always being the youngest.;
Really hasn't had much luck in life, that's for sure.${prompt};
Hm? You want to meet my friend who knows about Falak?${prompt};
Sorry, I sent 'em on important business at the Hazhalm Testing Grounds that needed taking care of.${prompt};
Actually, do you know the cave just beyond the Caedarva Mire?;
There's a secret Aht Urhgan facility deep inside it!${prompt};
There, they used forbidden alchemy techniques to fuse different species of creatures into strange new monstrosities.${prompt};
Their artificial creations are known as chimeras.${prompt};
Lamia, puk, mandragora...;
That facility has given life to countless creatures.${prompt};
It was a grand sanctuary of learning that attempted to approach the greatness of the gods themselves...${prompt};
I'm actually something of an alchemist myself, you know.${prompt};
I once used a stolen egg to create a chimera known as Khimaira 13, but it didn't turn out so well...${prompt};
I spent many agonizing days burned and tattered, but it did help me regain my sense of motivation.${prompt};
According to my friend, my beloved chimeras are needed for the dreaded battle yet to come.${prompt};
Hm? You want to know who this friend of Megomak's is?${prompt};
I already told you--on an errand for me at the Hazhalm Testing Grounds.;
That's definitely who you should talk to about Falak.${prompt};
Actually, my friend's been gone for a while now...${prompt};
I was hoping to steal another egg...${prompt};
Maybe the Empire discovered my little plan!;
I shudder to think what they might do to my friend!${prompt};
Hey, I need you to go check out the entrance to the Hazhalm Testing Grounds and see what's going on.;
I'm counting on you.${prompt};
Megomak wants you to investigate the entrance to the Hazhalm Testing Grounds.${prompt};
Ah, you're back. Did you investigate the Hazhalm Testing Grounds like I asked?${prompt};
What's this? This is the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I asked for!${prompt};
I'm not sure I understand the details, but it's good that I didn't go personally.${prompt};
I don't think Megomak could handle being chased around by some haughty automaton.${prompt};
At any rate, where are the Destiny Destroyers now?${prompt};
I told them how to reach the elder, so perhaps they went straight there.${prompt};
Ah, and here I was ready to treat them to ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} too...${prompt};
Hm? What are you still doing here?${prompt};
Oh, that's right! You wanted to learn more about Falak!${prompt};
You see, it all began several thousand years ago.${prompt};
Falak attempted to lay waste to Aht Urhgan, but was eventually stopped and separated into nine pieces.${prompt};
However, what you refer to as the Olduum civilization gave rise to some ingenious alchemists who knew nothing of fear.${prompt};
They lifted the seal on the “Urn of Sealing” and took those nine pieces and used them to create entirely new beings, consisting of three pieces each.${prompt};
That is how the three chimeras known as Tinnin, Sarameya, and Tyger were created, and research into chimeras began.${prompt};
You people don't get it...${prompt};
If Tinnin, Sarameya, and Tyger are combined, it'll lead to Falak's resurrection!${prompt};
Ah, there you are! I received the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} from this person here!${prompt};
You... Have we met before?${prompt};
How will you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, we have.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
Bah, who cares? Hurry up and finish the story, will you?;
In a way, it's about you, right?${prompt};
Fine. The hero of this story happens to be one of my ancestors.${prompt};
My ancestor was a renowned hero who came across a human who he could communicate with, a man named Ramuul.;
Even though he was human, he knew the danger posed by Falak.;
With the stone tablets, he sealed it away through three “islands”!${prompt};
To do so, he used a powerful relic known as the Olduum staff.;
Only it is capable of breaking the rock!${prompt};
The tablet has become quite the hot spot. The place is crawling with the undead.${prompt};
Hey, Megomak. Do you think this crew is up to the task of protecting the staff?${prompt};
I've been assured as much. You needn't worry.${prompt};
Hey! Guard that thing like your life depends on it, because it does!;
You can't let it fall into the hands of the undead!${prompt};
You're on your way to visit the elder, right?;
You can find out more there.${prompt};
Okay! Let's get going!;
Thanks for the help!${prompt};
Take care!;
Well, did you get all that?;
Basically, Falak is dangerous, and if the Immortals get their clammy hands on the Olduum staff, that monster will be brought back to life.${prompt};
Although, now that you know, I don't expect it to change anything for the better.;
Just stay out of our way, okay?${prompt};
See you around. I've got experiments to perform on behalf of my beloved chimeras.${prompt};
Return to Ghatsad and report what you have learned from Megomak and the others.${prompt};
