It all began with a stone, or so the legend says.${prompt};
In ages past, a sentient jewel, enormous and beautiful, banished the darkness.;
Its many-colored light filled the world with life and brought forth mighty gods.;
Bathed in that light, the world entered an age of bliss until, after a time, the gods fell into slumber.;
That world was called Vana'diel.;
Our world, Vana'diel...${prompt};
Ah, you must be...${prompt};
You are ${name-player}, correct?;
My name is Ulmia.${prompt};
Hm?;
You wish to know the name of the song?${prompt};
It is called the “Lay of the Immortals.” It has been passed down through the Tavnazian Cathedral since ancient times.${prompt};
The history of our people may often be lost to the flames of war and catastrophe. However, this song of guidance shall never be forgotten...${prompt};
Are you the one who was singing just now?${prompt};
Nag'molada...was it not?${prompt};
Even after the longest of trials, there are some things that will never be lost. How very nostalgic.${prompt};
In a place quite similar to this one, a song was born in an age when such things did not exist.;
Amazing to hear the birth of song, the first song...${prompt};
The birth of song...?${prompt};
Is it possible that you know of this lay?${prompt};
Yes, I know it well.;
It is known as the “Memoria de la S^tona.”;
There is another verse.;
However, this age will not last. The great bane will devour the fair land of Vana'diel.;
The ancient seal will be broken, awakening nightmares of ages past.;
A tragic age of darkness will reign.;
And yet, the gods will not wake from their slumber...;
That world was called Vana'diel.${prompt};
...${prompt};
This is no fabrication.;
The memory of the crystal is the memory of Vana'diel.;
No one, mortal or immortal, can warp the truth of these words.${prompt};

You must tell me one thing.;
Is that how the song ends...?${prompt};
No, the song continues.${prompt};
But the next verse is beyond the limits of your mortal voice.;
Only the gods are allowed to sing forth its melody.${prompt};
The gods...;
Whatever could he mean...?${prompt};
Hm?;
Prishe has summoned me?;
Very well, let us return to town.${prompt};
!?;
Whoa!;
What the hell happened here!?${prompt};
Is this...;
Cape Riverne...!?${prompt};
And what the hell is this thing!?${prompt};
Ahhh!;
Prishe!?;
${name-player}?;
You were looking for me?${prompt};
"Forgive me; I knew not what to do.${prompt}";
In times such as this, I come here to sing.${prompt};
Listen...;
This wind can carry your thoughts and dreams.${prompt};
It will rise up into the boundless sky and soar over the ocean, echoing across the entire world...${prompt};
Gentle Altana will hear your supplication and bestow her blessings upon you.${prompt};
When I was but a young girl, I came here to whisper a prayer to the Goddess.;
And truly was it answered.${prompt};
What's the matter with you?${prompt};
What are you so worked up about?${prompt};
You're so full of angst, I could hear your thoughts from malms away!${prompt};
!?${prompt};
You don't have to say a thing.${prompt};
Let's see now...${prompt};
Huh?;
You didn't make it into the choir?${prompt};
You were too nervous to sing in front of everyone?;
Unbelievable.${prompt};
I guess I can understand why you'd wanna join the cathedral choir.;
You get to wear those pretty clothes, and every meal is a feast!${prompt};
But it's not the end of the world, you know!${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
Listen to me.;
You might be too young to realize it, but this world is one damn big place!${prompt};
Lemme put it this way.${prompt};
The world that stretches away to the right...${prompt};
And the world that stretches away to the left...${prompt};
Combined with the world above and the world below...${prompt};
That's a whole lotta world around you!${prompt};
Do you get it?;
This marquisate you live in is just one part of the Tavnazian Archipelago, which is just one part of the world of Vana'diel...${prompt};
The world of Ulmia is just one tiny little corner of all that!${prompt};
But I guess your dream of singing in the choir is over.${prompt};
And so is your parents' dream that you enter that world...${prompt};
But the world where you sing can still exist in Vana'diel!${prompt};
Do you see!?;
C'mon, let's hear you sing!;
Let's make that world right here!${prompt};
Prishe, you've snuck out of the cathedral again...${prompt};
Cardinal Mildaurion!${prompt};
See you around, Ulmia!${prompt};
Thanks to Prishe, my wish was granted and I was able to join the choir.${prompt};
That was when I learned she was the “abhorrent one” who had long been connected with the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt};
I also discovered that the power she was born from should be reviled--not Prishe herself.${prompt};
However...;
That was not the only time that Prishe was to help me.${prompt};
When we were swept up in the storm of war...;
Were it not for her power, I doubt we would have survived the terrible fate that befell our city.${prompt};
What she accomplished was nothing short of a miracle.${prompt};
As you are no doubt aware, while we were on the mainland, a plea for aid to Jeuno was made with Nag'molada's assistance.${prompt};
The eyes of the people of Tavnazia were shining so very brightly. Just as they did that time...when Prishe was still called the abhorrent one...${prompt};
Dawn Goddess, bless me with your wisdom.;
We need your guidance in choosing the right path of action.${prompt};
What must I do?;
Is Prishe truly deserving of such revilement?${prompt};
I wish to save her, but in doing so do I damn myself?;
Surely such an act can be forgiven?${prompt};
Oh my!?;
Bahamut, one of the terrestrial avatars...;
Could Bahamut be the one to answer my questions...?${prompt};
${name-player},;
I will go to meet with him.${prompt};
Would you accompany me on my journey? We go to Monarch Linn, the home of Bahamut.${prompt};
${name-player}!;
You're here!${prompt};
I hope I did not keep you waiting.;
It took some time to convince Justinius...${prompt};
Of course it did.;
Even if Prishe were here, there's no way I'd be letting a young lady climb into that den of beasts all alone.${prompt};
She is not alone.${prompt};
You're that man from the East...${prompt};
With an experienced adventurer like ${name-player}, and the Phoenix Blade at my side, there is nothing for her to fear.${prompt};
It would seem that Bahamut is indeed close by.${prompt};
Now let us begin our climb!${prompt};
Can't let you do that!${prompt};
Who goes there!?${prompt};
Hehehe.${prompt};
Your every move...${prompt};
...is so predictable!${prompt};
You three...${prompt};
Meeting with Bahamut is forbidden!${prompt};
Mister Nag'molada said so!${prompt};
Trespassers are to be punished!${prompt};
What wickedness is this!?;
Time to get warped, lawbreaker!;
She...she cast the wrong warp!?${prompt};
She cast the wrong warp!!!${prompt};
Leave these idiots to me. I'll catch up.${prompt};
It's about time someone taught these pranksters a lesson.${prompt};
Our thanks, Justinius!${prompt};
Do not be too harsh on them.${prompt};
You're not getting away!${prompt};
Feel my mighty spells!${prompt};
So, ${name-player}, you have come as well.${prompt};
As Prishe described, this is the entrance to the first basement of the Sacrarium.${prompt};
The way is barred, but I believe Prishe holds the key to this dilemma.${prompt};
We must return and borrow her amulet...${prompt};
Hiya! Sorry to keep you two waiting!;
Lady Prishe!?${prompt};
I can get us past that door!;
It's time for us to pay a visit to Divine Promathia!${prompt};
I did not expect Prishe herself to accompany us.;
I'm amazed she was allowed to leave her confines.${prompt};
C'mon! If you don't get a move on, I'll leave you behind!${prompt};
Why do I get the feeling something terrible awaits us...?${prompt};
But I cannot let that deter me from my course.;
We must forge onward!${prompt};
${name-player}...;
You did well to find this place.;
I assume you were led here by the memories of the mothercrystal?${prompt};
Even if the Crystal Line is cut, as long as people exist, and as long as there is life on Vana'diel, the memories of the mothercrystal will endure.${prompt};
There is nothing anyone can do to change that.${prompt};
We are all born from the light of the crystal, and we return to that luminescence when we die...${prompt};
(People are also born from the darkness, and return to the darkness...)${prompt};
...?${prompt};
(The opposites of light and dark... Both are held within you...)${prompt};
(You are born from the light that illuminates all, and then slowly devoured by the Emptiness that desires only oblivion...)${prompt};
(This is the cycle begun by the Goddess of the Dawn.;
The cycle created for the sake of the Twilight God, Promathia...)${prompt};
${name-player}...;
How can you speak to my soul...?${prompt};
Selh'teus...;
What have you done to ${name-player}...?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Now is not the time to answer such questions, is it?${prompt};
After the passing of ten thousand years, it is time for us to discover why our paths have crossed again.${prompt};
Selh'teus.;
The pact you left with the terrestrial avatars has been honored by the children of Vana'diel...${prompt};
The coming of the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been prevented.${prompt};
However, Bahamut does not hold the pact to be complete.${prompt};
Is it true that unless the Keeper of the Apocalypse is freed from the cycle of the mothercrystal, the pact cannot be considered fulfilled?${prompt};
...${prompt};
You need not use common speech.${prompt};
The amulet--the testament of affinity--connects my soul to yours.${prompt};
Let us finally walk the same path that has brought us here over the span of ten thousand years.;
For Vana'diel, and for the future.${prompt};
He has eluded me yet again...${prompt};
Was that your plan, Esha'ntarl?${prompt};
To use the testament of affinity to link your souls?;
You meant to have your soul taken over, just as Prishe did.${prompt};
No.;
Your plan was to make it appear as if your soul had been possessed. A way to protect yourself, perhaps?${prompt};
An excuse for letting Selh'teus escape.${prompt};
...${prompt};
No feeble attempts at denial?;
Just what I'd expect from a Zilart.${prompt};
But I have learned the truth from the mothercrystal.;
You were born a Kuluu, as was I.${prompt};
The Chamber of Eventide created by Dawnmaiden Yve'noile to heal the Kuluu people...to restore the whispers to their souls...${prompt};
I should have realized when Bahamut mentioned that name.${prompt};
Am I correct in assuming that the Zilart interfered in the investigation of Al'Taieu to hide the fact of its completion?${prompt};
Was my Kuluu talent in negotiation so very valuable to you?${prompt};
...;
The celestial city of Al'Taieu was destroyed along with the Chamber of Eventide, ten thousand years ago.${prompt};
No matter how much I explain, you will not believe me--but the Zilart still hold to this truth.${prompt};
When Al'Taieu was enfolded in the energy of the crystal, the power of the terrestrial avatars was absorbed by the city.${prompt};
That event caused an anomaly in space and time, bringing them from the ancient past to the present day...;
Or so the theory goes.${prompt};
As a Kuluu, I do not presume to speak for the beliefs of the Zilart...${prompt};
But I have received some fascinating insights from Diabolos.${prompt};
He claims that the celestial capital exists even now, beyond the fifth crystal.${prompt};
And that the Zilart people living in the city are alive and well.${prompt};
It cannot be...!${prompt};
This information must be verified.;
I will travel beyond the distortion in space and time and see this place for myself.${prompt};
And then I will use the Chamber of Eventide to gain immortality, as you have.;
The whisper of the soul will be mine again.${prompt};
Nag'molada...${prompt};
Your longing to become one of the Zilart led to your betrayal of the Kuluu...${prompt};
But you must not go to the capital.;
Selh'teus has warned me.${prompt};
Al'Taieu is no longer the homeland that we once knew.;
It has become a tainted place. A forbidden place.${prompt};
Forbidden?${prompt};
Use this to see into the soul of Selh'teus.;
He will explain everything to you.${prompt};
So I can let that traitor take control of my mind?${prompt};
For the moment, I will be satisfied with watching you die.;
We'll just say that you were killed by Selh'teus, shall we?${prompt};
...!;
Wait! If you spare me, I will give you anything you want!${prompt};
You'll give me anything...!?;
Ahahaha, you certainly were born of Kuluu stock!;
Show me how far you have fallen!${prompt};
...;
I am not the one who has fallen.${prompt};
And sold!;
To the young Tarutaru lady!;
Home delivery guaranteed!;
I truly appreciate your help.;
A most reliable trio, indeed.${prompt};
I doubt Nag'molada will be able to stay in Jeuno after this.;
You have shown commendable judgment in this matter.${prompt};
'Tweren't nothing!${prompt};
However, Selh'teus has gone...${prompt};
The celestial capital that Selh'teus showed me...;
Could it be...${prompt};
I think I understand...${prompt};
The battle with the wyrms is about to begin.;
A meaningless war will soon be set in motion.${prompt};
(There is no other choice but to fight...;
Great Goddess Altana... Bless us with the victory we need...)${prompt};
So the Emptiness has now devoured Hakutei River...${prompt};
With the waters gone, bandit tribes have little trouble staging raids across the border.;
Our empire's defenses are crumbling.${prompt};
Lord Tenzen, your blade knows no equal.;
I beg of you to return and lead our soldiers into battle.${prompt};
But my guiding flame has been extinguished...${prompt};
We are aware of your situation.;
However, the emperor will grant you his forgiveness.${prompt};
You need only conquer the barbarians that mass against us, and reignite the Phoenix Blade upon their flesh.${prompt};
And if that is not enough?${prompt};
Then it will be time to undertake our most desperate plan.;
Based on your information, we will invade the city of Jeuno.${prompt};
Liberating the mothercrystals is the only way to stem the tide of Emptiness.${prompt};
You speak truly.;
And yet I cannot return to our country.;
Not until I carry out the final duty entrusted to me by the noble Phoenix.${prompt};
Final duty...?${prompt};
When the Phoenix Blade released its energy to shield us from Bahamut, I could hear every single voice.${prompt};
The voices of all the children who, in my weakness, I failed to save.${prompt};
If I betray them here, it will be an unforgivable insult to their faith in me.;
I must strive until the end, with the very last spark of this life I have pledged.${prompt};
I will secure the safety of the mothercrystals upon which rests the fate of Vana'diel...${prompt};
Understood, Lord Tenzen.;
Your words will be relayed.${prompt};
...;
${name-player}, I did not see you.;
Are you alone?${prompt};
I, too, have found myself alone.${prompt};
These sudden separations are truly a lonely experience, don't you agree?${prompt};
Phoenix has ordered me to lead you to the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt};
And we must hurry.${prompt};
There is little remaining of the time her sacrifice has bought us.${prompt};
Let us board the airship for Jeuno.${prompt};
Beep...beep...beep...beep...${prompt};
Beeeep. Click, whirrr...${prompt};
Buzz... Beep beep!${prompt};
You sense the foul stench of death...${prompt};
There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt};
Thieving burglar!;
Burgling robber!;
Robbing thief!${prompt};
This is our precious hideout!${prompt};
Where we keep our precious treasure!${prompt};
I bet you stole our precious ${item-singular: 1[2]}, too!${prompt};
Give it back!;
Give it back!;
Give it back!;
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}?;
What brings you to this place?${prompt};
Master Cid wishes to analyze that box to aid in the repair of the airship engine?${prompt};
My small masters, it seems this vessel is essential for the success of our mission.;
I beseech you to surrender the box to ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}.${prompt};
We must take to the heavens without delay if we are to save the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt};
Lord Tenzen...${prompt};
We are moved by your speech...${prompt};
And find no choice but to act as you beseech.${prompt};
I am most glad to hear that, but please, you need not call me “Lord”...${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}, I leave the vessel in your capable hands.;
See that it finds its way to Master Cid.${prompt};
I regret that I cannot accompany you, but I must return with these three.${prompt};
You just keep in mind that eventually...${prompt};
We'll get you...${prompt};
And your little moogle, too!${prompt};
A creature has appeared out of nowhere!${prompt};
There is nothing else of interest here.${prompt};
Logging is possible here if you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Probability of loss = ${number: 3}/10000.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 7[2]} breaks!;
You successfully cut off ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!;
You cut off ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but your ${item-singular: 7[2]} breaks in the process.;
You are unable to log anything.;
You cannot carry any more items. Your inventory is full.;
Ah, I see your preparations are complete.${prompt};
Y-yes...;
L-let us b-begin...quickly!${prompt};
Relax, my troubled Enaremand. All shall be realized in due time. One cannot rush the flow of the eternal lifestream.${prompt};
...;
The spirits will answer our call when they are ready.;
...Despite whether we are or not...${prompt};
Are you ready, my friends?${prompt};
${name-player}.;
Please place the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} here.${prompt};
Now.;
Let us see what angel floats down from the clouds of Paradise...${prompt};
Or what beast treads forth from the ichor of the Styx...${prompt};
P-please... By the light of Altana...!${prompt};
A-Alsha!${prompt};
As I expected...;
${name-player}! You know what you must do! But be swift!${prompt};
You place the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} gently on the ground.${prompt};
M-m-m-my...m-m-m-my beloved Alsha...${prompt};
Wh-what have you done! Y-you m-m-m-monster!${prompt};
Enaremand...;
Do you still not realize?${prompt};
It is not ${name-player} who is the m-m-m-monster.${prompt};
B-but Alsha... Sh-she w-was... Sh-she was...${prompt};
She was nothing more than a puppet--a crude golem pieced together from sticks and clay. She was not your Alsha.${prompt};
Y-you don't understand! Y-you don't know the hell I've experienced these past t-twenty years. The hell I'm in now!${prompt};
But what did you expect by knocking on the gates of the underworld?${prompt};
I warned you, my friend...${prompt};
I...;
There is n-nothing left for m-m-m-me in this world... Curse you, Altana!;
Come, darkness. Take m-m-m-me to your kingdom!${prompt};
The infernal mists have lifted...${prompt};
...${prompt};
......!${prompt};
Alsha!${prompt};
I...;
You...${prompt};
S-so beautiful...;
Nothing like m-my m-mannequin...${prompt};
Oh...;
I'm so sorry, Alsha.;
What was I thinking?${prompt};
I knew all along that I could never replace you...recreate you. But I was so lost...${prompt};
Perhaps if I had just looked harder...I would have found you...${prompt};
Right here, in my heart...${prompt};
${name-player}...;
I apologize for all I have put you through, and thank you for your assistance.${prompt};
Please accept this as a token of my gratitude, though I realize there is no real way I can repay you...${prompt};
To stand by that troubled man's side throughout his ordeals... You are quite a better ${choice-player-gender}[man/person] than I, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Hm? Oh, I did nothing but what was required of me.${prompt};
Things would have been no different if it were you who asked to bring back someone you had lost.${prompt};
What? You believe I called forth that demon on purpose?${prompt};
Do I look like the person who would commit such an abominable act?${prompt};
Ha ha...;
Perhaps I do...;
And perhaps I knew all along that while there are countless ways to reanimate the body, there are none to reanimate the soul.${prompt};
However, considering the state that our friend Enaremand was in, the only way to make him realize this was...${prompt};
Well, you understand what I mean.;
And now, maybe for the first time in twenty years, poor Enaremand can break free from the bonds of times faded, and begin living in the light of today.${prompt};
The past has no place in the present but in the form of memories...${prompt};
And we must let those memories support us as our dreams guide us into the future.${prompt};
......${prompt};
${name-player}, I am delighted that this crossing of our paths was fated.${prompt};
Though I sense that this will not be the last time...${prompt};
The ground here is littered with the pieces of a shattered shield...${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is suddenly snatched away!${prompt};
Nothing happens...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}A drop of oil trickles down the cheek of the mannequin.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Large drops of oil begin pouring from the eyes on the mannequin.${prompt};
There is nothing here yet.;
Check again in the morning.${prompt};
The trap already contains ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
There appears to be some kind of trap here.;
Bits of fish are lying around the area.${prompt};
You did not catch anything.${prompt};
You put ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in the trap.${prompt};
${name-player}, I have been looking for you.;
Come. We have confidential matters to discuss.${prompt};
I must speak with you regarding the Wyrmking Bahamut.${prompt};
You may recall him returning to the heavens, but I have received confirmation that he has once again descended upon Cape Riverne.${prompt};
Judging from the activity of the wyrms remaining in the various regions of Vana'diel, I suspected that they had yet to regain their faith in mankind.${prompt};
Most importantly, Tavnazia is in danger.;
Prishe and Ulmia have already been informed. I assume that you will also lend them your aid.${prompt};
Help out?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
Then you should head to Cape Riverne. Prishe and Ulmia have probably already departed.${prompt};
I see you have other matters to attend to. I know that you would not turn your back on Prishe and Ulmia, though.${prompt};
I am sure we have a little time. Return here when you are ready.${prompt};
I don't understand. Bahamut is nowhere to be found in Monarch Linn! We've searched all over the south side...${prompt};
We must be looking on the wrong side. Let's try again, Prishe.${prompt};
${name-player}?;
I'm so glad you're here! Nothing could reassure me more than your presence.${prompt};
A member of the Tavnazian Patrol witnessed Bahamut returning to Cape Riverne with an army of wyrms.${prompt};
We've looked all over the south side, but Bahamut is nowhere to be found. We're about to begin searching the north side, now.${prompt};
It will take a while to search every island, so I think we should split up.${prompt};
Let's go, Prishe.${prompt};
Oh ${name-player}, I am simply delighted to see you again!${prompt};
Surprised?;
I'm a regular girl now, you know! Tehehe!${prompt};
So, it's you. I knew we would meet again, but I must say, this is sooner than I expected.${prompt};
You have done well, but you are naive to think that your troubles would end so easily.${prompt};
What are you planning!?${prompt};
Your friend here held in her body a crystallized form of the Emptiness. You returned it to the mothercrystals, did you not?${prompt};
...!;
I sense the will that embodied the Emptiness. It has yet to awaken into this world, but it is tremendously powerful.${prompt};
The mothercrystals are already beginning to feel its effects, enveloped in the Emptiness as they are. It is stirring...${prompt};
My magicite...${prompt};
Mankind will be annihilated. You have simply delayed the process.${prompt};
Do you dare to defy fate once again and fight to preserve your lives?${prompt};
Defy fate and fight?;
${selection-lines};
Fight and live!;
Fate is inevitable.${prompt};
Children of Vana'diel! ${choice: 0}[Stand in defiance/Accept your fate] and perish! Redeem the world as a part of the mothercrystals!;
You have delayed mankind's extinction yet again...${prompt};
An age is a mere flicker to a wyrm. However, enough flickers united form a star.${prompt};
Children of Vana'diel.;
Unite and form a future in which mankind can survive.;
Let's go home for now, Prishe.${prompt};
Okay...${prompt};
${name-player}, please tell Cardinal Mildaurion about this the next time you are in Jeuno.${prompt};
The “Star of Tavnazia”... The stone Prishe released when Promathia was defeated...${prompt};
The children of Vana'diel harbor the Emptiness inside their bodies, even if just a small amount. I envisioned it causing problems before too many thousands of years passed.${prompt};
However, I never dreamed that we would face such a threat so soon.${prompt};
We have no choice now but to stop Bahamut.${prompt};
I have a feeling that he was waiting for you, desiring a confrontation.${prompt};
Bahamut pays respect to the strong, regardless of stature. It is for that reason he is called the Wyrmking.${prompt};
You must gather an army of adventurers and challenge him yet again.;
Show our adversary the strength of mankind!${prompt};
As for me, I will conduct a thorough investigation of the emanations coming from the mothercrystals. Perhaps I will find something of interest.${prompt};
If you can unlock all the secrets of Vana'diel, we may meet again. I hope with every fabric of my being that that time will come.${prompt};
${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};

Voidwatch Ops.;
How to participate.;
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.;
Stratum abyssite.;

Atmacite.;
Periapt.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};

Do my eyes deceive me? Is that...${name-player}?${prompt};
You are looking quite well.;
That is to say, your presence brings me such delight.;
I am quite pleased to...see...${prompt};
<Gulp>...${prompt};
You cannot possibly be here for...?${prompt};
How will you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I want your aid in Trust.;
I just came to say hello.${prompt};
Oh, thank goodness!${prompt};
...Huh? No, I mean that it is wonderful to see your face again!${prompt};
Please, enjoy your time here in Tavnazia. Prishe and I will always welcome you with open arms.${prompt};
M-me?;
Oh, no, I am afraid I would have nothing to offer.${prompt};
I am still more accustomed to arias than adventures...${prompt};
And, er, my throat! It's positively ghastly!;
<Cough> <cough>...${prompt};
What will you tell her?;
${selection-lines};
But I really need your help...;
Well, I hope you feel better...${prompt};
...I must admit that I was not being wholly truthful.${prompt};
It is not my throat which has failed me, but my courage.${prompt};
I am afraid. Afraid of what will happen when another me comes into existence.${prompt};
Many years past, a short while after I joined the choir, I lost my voice.${prompt};
Then, one day I overheard two people talking in hushed voices.${prompt};
“There are so many people who can take Ulmia's place.”${prompt};
I had forgotten how those memories stabbed at my heart...until I laid eyes on my alter ego.${prompt};
${name-player}, I am truly frightened.${prompt};
What is your response?;
${selection-lines};
What happened next?;
Think back on Al'Taieu!;
Remember that a new world has begun!${prompt};
Next...?${prompt};
Ah, you mean with my voice. I was able to sing once more thanks to Prishe.${prompt};
She said, “All you need to do is find a boyfriend!”${prompt};
She was regaling some poor boy with false tales of my affection before I screamed out for her to stop.${prompt};
Everything returned to normal, as if I had never been afflicted in the first place.${prompt};
At the time, I figured she was trying to play a joke on me, but as I grew older I realized her true intent.${prompt};
Perhaps there are many others who could become singers...${prompt};
...but I like to think no one could take my place in the hearts of those dear to me.${prompt};
If you feel deep in your heart that no one could take my place, then I will try my best.${prompt};
You are right, of course. Back then I had nothing to fear.${prompt};
I felt I could take on the world if it meant saving you and Prishe.${prompt};
The road was long, with twists and turns over deep crevasses, but you were there to lead Prishe and me to our destinies.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, you've awoken some very wonderful memories.${prompt};
I remember now what it meant to be brave.${prompt};
How curious...;
Prishe said the exact same words to me when I was barely knee-high to a Moblin.${prompt};
I am sure you can derive as much bravery from them as I do.${prompt};
It means so much that you came all this way just to see me.${prompt};
Your compassion has moved me, ${name-player}. I shall attempt the ritual with you.${prompt};
When I sang the Lay of the Immortals before the fifth crystal, it stirred up emotions within me.${prompt};
It dawned on me that it was not the oppressive weight of darkness that brought us together, but the holy light of the crystals.${prompt};
So now...${prompt};
O Goddess, I beseech thee to lend thine aid.${prompt};
Make manifest the bonds that unite ${name-player} and me!${prompt};
Releasing a soul from its shackles requires the steadfastness of heart to seek out the truth.${prompt};
I would like to embark on another journey so that I might find myself.${prompt};
And I desire to have you beside me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
What does it mean to find oneself?${prompt};
${name-player}, it seems that every time we meet you give me yet more food for thought. Thank you.${prompt};
Perhaps the day will come when I am able to sing about you.;
Until then, please, take my alter ego with you.${prompt};
...Take us with you.${prompt};

I have made a bit of recovery and feel ready to move mountains.${prompt};
...I must let you know that I chanced upon Siren once more.${prompt};
She told me something that perhaps you already know:;
“Your presence here brings naught but chaos to this world.”${prompt};
She also curiously explained that this was the case for herself as well.${prompt};
But her situation is a trifle different, for her incarnation already exists in this time.${prompt};
If the two were to join, a small semblance of order would return, perhaps causing one of the rifts to close.${prompt};
...And compared to that, my existence is an affront to all nature.${prompt};
Ooof...;
I did not mean to trouble you so.${prompt};
Master, your orb has been blessed with even more power than before, has it not?${prompt};
What a comforting glow...${prompt};
I have heard of such a phenomenon, but to witness it up close...;
I am deeply moved by all you have accomplished to get this far.${prompt};
Many and more have supported you in your adventures throughout Vana'diel.${prompt};
This time, I can sense the presence of another who featured prominently in tales of your adventures: Lilisette.${prompt};
And you have been assaulted by the ambassador once more!${prompt};
You bested him?${prompt};
Master, your strength is boundless!${prompt};
But...he got away, and we are no closer to the truth than we were before?${prompt};
And there were others following in his stead!?${prompt};
Please, share with me the story from the very beginning, and spare no detail.${prompt};
He was wielding Excalibur? But...how?${prompt};
But only one of those exists in this world! How could he possibly...;
Unless...${prompt};
Why would he single you out for assault?${prompt};
Master, I require further training at once! Will you show me all I need to know?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I need a minute to think.;
You've caught me off guard.${prompt};
Of course. I understand your hesitation.${prompt};
I shall wait for you to come to a decision.${prompt};
Master, have you settled on which type of training I am to undergo?${prompt};
What type of training?;
${selection-lines};
Strength training.;
Endurance training.;
Style training.;
I need a moment to think.${prompt};
I confess that I am lacking definition in my arms and legs.${prompt};
I quite understand why you desire me to put on some healthy weight, and shall respect your decision.${prompt};
And you would like to bring me a small gift to boost my spirits? Your generous soul sparkles throughout the ages.${prompt};
Whilst undergoing training, my mother often opined about the benefits of ${item-plural: 1[2]} and their effect on muscle growth.${prompt};
${number: 0} ${item-given-plurality: 0[2], 1[2]} would be more than sufficient to see me reach my goal.${prompt};
Ah, my fragile constitution has long dogged me.${prompt};
I quite understand why you desire me to build up my resistance, and shall respect your decision.${prompt};
And you would like to bring me a small gift to boost my spirits? Your generous soul sparkles throughout the ages.${prompt};
Whilst undergoing training, my mother often opined about the benefits of ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and its ability to mend all wounds.${prompt};
${number: 0} ${item-given-plurality: 0[2], 2[2]} would be more than sufficient to see me reach my goal.${prompt};
You wish me...to be more stylish?${prompt};
I understand your desire. My mother often opined that a ninja must do all she can to blend in.${prompt};
But alas, I am no ninja.${prompt};
And you would like to bring me a small gift to boost my spirits? Your generous soul sparkles throughout the ages.${prompt};
My father often opined about the benefits of ${item-plural: 3[2]} and how they helped to keep my mother's skin smooth and soft.${prompt};
${number: 0} ${item-given-plurality: 0[2], 3[2]} would be more than sufficient to see me reach my goal.${prompt};
Of course. Deciding on an appropriate path takes time.${prompt};
Master, this is wonderful!${prompt};
I anxiously await learning under your steady hand and unyielding gaze!${prompt};
I pledge to give it my all...${prompt};
...Using all means available to me.${prompt};
That was invigorating!${prompt};
...But it does put a strain on the stomach. Master, let us share a rice ball.${prompt};
There was something on your chin.${prompt};
F-forgive me! I reverted to my old ways...before we met.${prompt};
It is a curse from my mother's upbringing. She always said that healthy eating was the key to lustrous black hair.${prompt};
And when we first met, you complimented how well it matched my features.${prompt};
Of course, that is not something I could hope for you to remember.${prompt};
But I was young then, and each day seemed a year long...yet your praise has stuck with me ever since.${prompt};
Thanks to your kind words, I have taken care of it as my pride and joy.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
It really is quite stunning.;
You really value it, don't you?;
And your mother?${prompt};
Even in this time, you already know how to make me blush.${prompt};
I do. It is a critical part of my identity.${prompt};
You've already met her...but I'll leave that as a secret for now.${prompt};
This reminds me...${prompt};
The ambassador told you he wishes to change the future, did he not?${prompt};
Why would he need to muster the forces of darkness to do so?${prompt};
I cannot make heads or tails of it.${prompt};
What do you think?;
${selection-lines};
He wants the future to be enshrouded.;
He wants the future to be pitch-black.;
He wants the darkness to come faster.;
I haven't the foggiest.${prompt};
In other words, he wants to make the future much like my own.${prompt};
But then how would “change” come into play?${prompt};
Perhaps you find this to be odd, but such a fate might be preferable to the world I know.${prompt};
Yet my head still spins at the thought of what that could mean.${prompt};
Father, if only I could share this pain...${prompt};
Ah, but that does seem to ring true.${prompt};
Your words have guided me out of my confusion.${prompt};
But then how do we explain Excalibur...${prompt};
Neither do I.${prompt};
Master, the time has come for you to clash with the ambassador.${prompt};
As you are eminently aware, I am able to return to this world owing to the blessing of Phoenix, and that power alone.${prompt};
Yet such an act is wholly forbidden.${prompt};
And there are limits to even that which as grand a power as Phoenix can achieve.${prompt};
Phoenix grows ever weaker each time I am brought back to life.${prompt};
It is selfish of me to use it endlessly, for in reality it is something you are supposed to rely on when faced with oblivion.${prompt};
You...are concerned with how I feel after being revived countless times?${prompt};
Any pain I may feel is a tiny prick compared to what I have suffered in my future.${prompt};
When I think back to how alone I was before coming here...my heart feels like it will burst.${prompt};
And deep inside...I am one weak person adrift upon the sea.${prompt};
Further, I arrived in a time a bit earlier than I had intended.${prompt};
Despite this...despite all my failings, Phoenix has seen fit to rescue me time and again.${prompt};
I am but a stain on all I hold dear!${prompt};
That's why I must be there in the final conflict against the ambassador.${prompt};
And if I should falter due to my own unpreparedness...${prompt};
...Then it shall be no one's fault but my own. I refuse to be a burden any longer.${prompt};
You have striven so hard to fill the orb I gave you with light, and I know you will be prepared for the final struggle.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I can't do it alone.;
Stay levelheaded!;
We can succeed with Altana's help.${prompt};
Master, none know that better than I.${prompt};
You've touched many during your adventures throughout the land--and not just those who have lent power to your orb.${prompt};
Even I understand that anything can be accomplished with the support of those close to you.${prompt};
Master, do not make light of my steadfast determination to protect all I hold dear.${prompt};
The Goddess Altana?${prompt};
I had not expected such a...divine proposal.${prompt};
You do not have to display such concern for me. After all, my presence here only serves as an affront to nature.${prompt};
Yet there is a certain logic... Perhaps She would be able to provide us with the guidance we so desperately seek.${prompt};
If any would know how to meet with Altana, it would be the ancients.${prompt};
You have a most queer look on your face, Master.${prompt};
On several occasions you told me about your encounters with them.${prompt};
Or perhaps “will tell me” would be a better phrase.${prompt};
Stories about Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche.${prompt};
Those who ruled over Jeuno were a different race than any of us.${prompt};
Their status as the grand ancestors of this world may provide us with clues.${prompt};
Ah, but I know.${prompt};
Those two have passed on. No, I speak of asking advice of the Kuluu.${prompt};
But we cannot simply drop in without making the proper preparations. We should seek advice from our allies in Norg.${prompt};
It would be folly, however, to believe that they would volunteer such information for only a kind word.${prompt};
No, we should first seek advice from Gilgamesh in Norg.${prompt};
It would be folly, however, to believe that they would volunteer such information for only a kind word.${prompt};
I would instead recommend that we seek out the Kuluu.${prompt};
But we cannot simply drop in without making the proper preparations. We should seek advice from our allies in Norg.${prompt};
Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}! What impeccable timing!${prompt};
Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}...;
I hope you can overcome your anger at me...${prompt};
Let it be water under the bridge, for now we need to do our utmost to help Iroha.${prompt};
According to Kagero, Lady Iroha is on the verge of making a decision.${prompt};
Whenever a woman from the Far East comes to a life-altering fork in the road, she undergoes a purification ritual.${prompt};
