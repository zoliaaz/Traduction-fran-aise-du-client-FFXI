(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};

I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};

I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;

It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;

As I sit in this cage and reflect, I feel the “true darkness” creeping ever closer... I must return to town at once.${prompt};
There's something foul in the air here. Can you not feel it? The “true darkness” is approaching.${prompt};
I give you my thanks, adventurer. I must now make haste back to town, where I can help ward off the darkness. We shall meet again.${prompt};

You've fought the beastmen so many times they don't even make a scratch on you now, right?${prompt};
Thank you. I've realized now that I must train the mind as well as the body. I must return and share this revelation!${prompt};
Thank you for freeing me earlier.;
I have decided to train both my body and mind from now on. Please accept this as gratitude.;
See how hard my students are working? It brings me great pleasure each day to see how much they are growing under my guidance.${prompt};

Who will protect the Empress while I am wiling away in this prison? Even perishing here would not absolve me if she is hurt!${prompt};
Praise be to you! I shall return now and ensure the Empress's safety. May she reign a thousand years!${prompt};

The mercenaries and the Imperial Army shall fight and perish as one to shield the Empress from harm!${prompt};

My presence was all for naught... My failure to protect the Astral Candescence is a transgression worthy of a thousand deaths...${prompt};

You! Yes, you! What do you think you're staring at, anyway? Go get the Astral Candescence back, and now!${prompt};...Hm ?
Ugh, you again. I have no patience for the mercenary mentality.${prompt};Toi ! Oui, toi ! Qu'est-ce que tu regardes, d'ailleurs ? Va récupérer la Luminescence Astrale, et tout de suite !${prompt}
But you do show some skill in battle.;Oh, toi encore. Je n'ai aucune patience pour la mentalité des mercenaires.${prompt}

I'm going to be stuck in here forrrever... I'll never get out like this...${prompt};Je te l'accorde, ${name-player}...${prompt}
What if they'rrre planning to drag me off to the headsman? I...I'm scared...${prompt};Je vais être coincé ici pour toujours... Je ne sortirai jamais comme ça...${prompt}
My knees start to wobble at the mere thought of those eerrrie fish people... I can't even move...${prompt};Et s'ils prévoient de m'emmener chez le bourreau ? J'ai... j'ai peur...${prompt}
What do you want?;Mes genoux se mettent à trembler rien qu'à la pensée de ces effrayants hommes-poissons... Je ne peux même pas bouger...${prompt}
I was just about to bust out of there myself!${prompt};Que veux-tu ?
Oh, I rrremember you.;J'étais sur le point de m'évader moi-même !${prompt}
Here, this is for you.;Oh, je me souviens de toi.
I-I'm not thanking you for anything. Don't get the wrrrong idea. This is just to cover the costs of your journey.;Tiens, c'est pour toi.${prompt}
Leave me alone. I can't stand merrrcenaries.${prompt};Je... je ne te remercie pour rien. Ne te fais pas de fausses idées. C'est juste pour couvrir les frais de ton voyage.${prompt}
Just make sure you don't get in our way when we're rrripping up the battlefield.${prompt};Laisse-moi tranquille. Je ne supporte pas les mercenaires.${prompt}
How am I going to get out of this...? The...the...Astral Candescence... What'll I tell the Empress...?${prompt};Assure-toi juste de ne pas nous gêner lorsque nous déchirerons le champ de bataille.${prompt}
...What!? I don't need you merrrcenaries' help. I could take the Astral Candescence back with both hands tied behind my back!${prompt};Comment vais-je m'en sortir...? La... la... Luminescence Astrale... Que vais-je dire à l'Impératrice...?${prompt}
Hmph, just because you think you know a thing or two about me now doesn't mean I like you.${prompt};...Quoi!? Je n’ai pas besoin de l’aide de mercenaires. Je pourrais récupérer la Luminescence Astrale les mains attachées dans le dos!${prompt}
I am a generrral. You are a mercenary.;Hum, ce n'est pas parce que tu penses en savoir un peu sur moi que ça signifie que je t'apprécie.${prompt}
Rrremember your station.${prompt};Je suis un général. Tu es un mercenaire.
Hey, lizard people!;Souviens-toi de ta place.${prompt}
I'm going to start breaking things if I don't get some food in here soon!${prompt};Hé, les hommes-lézards !
Damn, it's hot in here...;Je vais commencer à casser des trucs si je n'ai pas de nourriture ici bientôt !${prompt}
Hey, pipsqueak! Yes, you! Get me out of here before I dry up like a date!${prompt};Bon sang, il fait chaud ici...
I've still got life in my bones!;Hé, minus! Oui, toi! Sors-moi d'ici avant que je ne sèche comme une datte!${prompt}

When the beastmen invade, make sure you get behind us while we decimate the enemy. We wouldn't want you getting hurt now, would we?${prompt};Hé, tu es ${choice-player-gender}[l'homme/la femme] qui a bravé les hommes-bêtes pour me sauver plus tôt, n'est-ce pas? Merci! C'est pour toi.${prompt}
Gahahaha!${prompt};Lorsque les hommes-bêtes envahiront, assure-toi de rester derrière nous pendant que nous décimons l'ennemi. Nous ne voudrions pas que tu sois blessé, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
Damn, we lost bad, didn't we? They even managed to take the Astral Candescence... But it's times like these...${prompt};
Gahahaha!;Bon sang, nous avons perdu, n'est-ce pas? Ils ont même réussi à prendre la Luminescence Astrale... Mais c'est dans des moments comme ceux-là...${prompt}

We Serpent Generals will defend Al Zahbi with our lives.${prompt};Grâce à votre héroïque sauvetage, j'ai pu retourner à mon poste sain et sauf. Je tiens à vous montrer ma gratitude avec ce cadeau.
The mercenaries also have an important role in protecting the Empire. Do not forget that.${prompt};Nous, les Généraux Serpents, défendrons Al Zahbi de toutes nos forces.${prompt}

Originally, mercenaries like you would not be allowed in his presence. Only speak to him if you have important business, and mind your manners.${prompt};Voyez-vous le beau Elvaan là-bas ? C'est le Général du Ciel Rughadjeen, noble commandant des Serpent Generals.
This is a very trying time for our nation...${prompt};À l'origine, des mercenaires comme vous ne seraient pas autorisés en sa présence. Ne lui parlez que si vous avez des affaires importantes, et gardez vos manières.
Not long ago, the Serpent General Commander Rughadjeen went missing during a battle.${prompt};C'est une période très difficile pour notre nation...
There is no need for one such as you to get caught up in our nation's problems. You should return to your lands while you still can.${prompt};Il n'y a pas longtemps, le commandant des Serpent Generals Rughadjeen a disparu lors d'une bataille.
Have you found the item we spoke of?${prompt};Il n'y a pas besoin pour quelqu'un comme vous de se mêler des problèmes de notre nation. Vous devriez retourner dans vos terres tant que vous le pouvez encore.

The fearless Hume over there is the Flameserpent General Gadalar, champion of the Imperial Army.${prompt};(Attendez au salon de thé. Je viendrai une fois ma garde terminée.)${prompt}
He tore through the enemy lines in the battle against the Far East with the ferocity of a marid. You should stay away from him if you want to live a long life.${prompt};Le courageux Hume là-bas est le Général du Serpent de Feu, Gadalar, champion de l'Armée Impériale.${prompt}
I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but Flameserpent General Gadalar vanished in the fray of a recent battle here in the Imperial capital...${prompt};Il a déchiré les lignes ennemies dans la bataille contre l'Extrême-Orient avec la férocité d'un marid.

Just look at that girl. Isn't she cute? Her name is Mihli Aliapoh.;Nous étions désespérément dépassés en nombre... Peu importe combien nous nous sommes battus avec fureur et bravoure, cela n'a pas suffi.${prompt}
Don't let her looks fool you, though... She's the Springserpent General!${prompt};Regardez cette fille. N'est-elle pas mignonne ? Son nom est Mihli Aliapoh.
They say she comes from a nation that is allied to the Empire, and that she is working hard to fulfill her homeland's expectations. I'm behind her all the way!${prompt};Ne vous laissez pas tromper par son apparence... Elle est le Général du Serpent du Printemps !${prompt}
Sh-she's gone... Mihli Aliapoh was taken right from my side as I was fighting... I wasn't strong enough...${prompt};On dit qu'elle vient d'une nation alliée à l'Empire, et qu'elle travaille dur pour répondre aux attentes de son pays d'origine. Je la soutiens à fond !${prompt}
I...I couldn't protect her...${prompt};E-elle est partie... Mihli Aliapoh a été enlevée juste à mes côtés pendant que je me battais... Je n'ai pas été assez fort...${prompt}
See the giant Galka over there? He's the pride of our army--the great Stoneserpent General Zazarg.${prompt};Je... Je n'ai pas pu la protéger...${prompt}
He has an incredible amount of battle experience. He slumbers and eats together with us soldiers, and openly speaks his mind. He is a kind and reliable commander.${prompt};Voyez-vous le géant Galka là-bas ? C'est la fierté de notre armée--le grand Général du Serpent de Pierre, Zazarg.${prompt}
The great Stoneserpent General Zazarg... Deep inside, I believed nothing could defeat him...${prompt};Il a une expérience de combat incroyable. Il dort et mange avec nous, les soldats, et parle ouvertement de ses pensées. C'est un commandant gentil et fiable.${prompt}
But I will not give up. I will conquer my sadness, and defend the Empress and her Empire to the very last man! I am sure that Zazarg would desire for me to do so.${prompt};Le grand Général du Serpent de Pierre, Zazarg... Au fond de moi, je croyais que rien ne pouvait le vaincre...${prompt}
Hey, you!;Mais je n'abandonnerai pas. Je vaincrai ma tristesse et défendrai l'Impératrice et son Empire jusqu'au dernier homme ! Je suis sûr que Zazarg voudrait que je le fasse.${prompt}
You better not step a fraction closer to Lady Najelith.${prompt};Hé, toi !
Commander Najelith may be young, but she is one of the greatest bowmasters in all of Urhguum. She is also the great General of the Galeserpent. You must act with dignity and respect around her.${prompt};Tu ferais mieux de ne pas t'approcher d'un pouce de Dame Najelith.${prompt}
The great Najelith has been taken by the enemy!${prompt};Le commandant Najelith peut être jeune, mais elle est l'une des plus grandes maîtresses d'arc de tout Urhguum. Elle est également la grande Générale du Serpent de la Brise. Vous devez agir avec dignité et respect en sa présence.${prompt}
We may still have a chance, though. The beastmen are known to capture anyone that might be of use and keep them as prisoners...${prompt};La grande Najelith a été capturée par l'ennemi !${prompt}
What is it, mercenary?${prompt};Nous avons peut-être encore une chance, cependant. Les bêtes sont connues pour capturer quiconque pourrait leur être utile et les garder comme prisonniers...${prompt}
You have an introduction from Biyaada?;Que puis-je faire pour vous, mercenaire ?${prompt}

Hehehe.;Ah, vous êtes là pour me soutirer quelques histoires pour cette “Saga du Serpent du Ciel” dont tout le monde parle.${prompt}
I knew someone would come poking around sooner or later.${prompt};
I mean, how could you compose a ballad about the Serpent Generals and leave out the mighty Zazarg?${prompt};Je savais bien que quelqu'un viendrait fouiner tôt ou tard.${prompt}
Head on back to the Shararat Teahouse--I'll come by once my stint on the wall is done.${prompt};Je veux dire, comment pourriez-vous composer une ballade sur les Serpent Generals et laisser de côté le puissant Zazarg ?${prompt}
Hm?;Retournez au salon de thé Shararat--je viendrai une fois ma garde sur le mur terminée.${prompt}
You have some questions about General Najelith?${prompt};
Impudent dog.;
Did you think I'd sell her secrets to the first rumormonger to flash his coin purse?${prompt};
No?;
You're here with an introduction from Biyaada?${prompt};
And you mean to immortalize our Galeserpent General in song!?;
It's about time she was honored with a proper tribute!${prompt};
I would suggest speaking with the general herself. She's much more approachable than you might expect.${prompt};
You'll often find her in the Wajaom Woodlands during her off-duty hours.${prompt};
People say she spends her time there staring sadly at some arrow...${prompt};
It has me slightly worried, to tell the truth.${prompt};
In any case, it will be easier for you to speak away from the prying eyes and ears of the city.${prompt};

Astral Candescence with beastmen.;
Empire's current state of defense.${prompt};
“Sanction” is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.${prompt};
Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.${prompt};
When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.${prompt};
Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.${prompt};
But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.${prompt};
You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.${prompt};
You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting “Besieged” under “Region Info.”${prompt};
You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.${prompt};
“Besieged” occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.${prompt};
The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the “Astral Candescence” from the Empire's control.${prompt};
You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.${prompt};
All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.${prompt};
The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders!;
Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.${prompt};
Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.${prompt};
Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.${prompt};
If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.${prompt};
It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!${prompt};
When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.${prompt};
The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.${prompt};
Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.${prompt};
Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.${prompt};
The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!${prompt};
If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!${prompt};
We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.${prompt};
As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set “archaic mirrors” in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.${prompt};
If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} them to an Imperial guard.${prompt};
Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of ${number: 5}. The Imperial capital has seen ${number: 6} ${choice-plurality: 6}[victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of ${number: 7} ${choice-plurality: 7}[time/times].${prompt};
You do not possess the ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Please be aware that you can only recharge ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} once during the period between each Conquest tally.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is already fully charged.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has received ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[charge/charges] in exchange for ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. It is now fully recharged.${prompt};
Have you heard about the late Emperor Jalzahn?${prompt};
You have heard...;
${selection-lines};
A few things.;
...about who?${prompt};
Then you must have been in shock when he passed away. It was all so sudden...${prompt};
He was one of those rare leaders whose will lined up with that of the people. Compared to him, the current Empress is...well, just a little less agreeable, shall we say? Do not mention so to anyone else, though...${prompt};
You have never heard of Emperor Jalzahn!?;
He was Emperor until four years ago, when he left the mortal realm. His wife followed him shortly thereafter.${prompt};Vous n'avez jamais entendu parler de l'Empereur Jalzahn !?
During their lifetimes, the Emperor and Empress often mingled with the people of the Empire, even coming as far as the Commoners' Ward for visits. They were greatly loved by the public, and we always looked forward to seeing them...${prompt};Il était Empereur jusqu'à il y a quatre ans, quand il a quitté le monde mortel. Sa femme l'a suivi peu de temps après.${prompt}
The Astral Candescence gives off a melody called the Astral Wind, unperceivable by the mortal ear.${prompt};De leur vivant, l'Empereur et l'Impératrice se mêlaient souvent au peuple de l'Empire, allant même jusqu'au Quartier des Communs pour des visites. Ils étaient très aimés du public, et nous avions toujours hâte de les voir...${prompt}
How I would love to hear its heavenly chime one day... I wonder if there is a way...${prompt};La Candescence Astrale émet une mélodie appelée le Vent Astral, imperceptible à l'oreille mortelle.${prompt}
That place is called the “Hall of Binding.” The door is always closed, and the place gives everyone the creeps. They say that a great treasure called the “Astral Candescence” is kept there.${prompt};Comme j'aimerais entendre un jour son carillon céleste... Je me demande s'il y a un moyen...${prompt}
Being so secretive just makes people more curious, though...${prompt};Cet endroit s'appelle le “Hall des Liens.” La porte est toujours fermée, et l'endroit donne la chair de poule à tout le monde. On dit qu'un grand trésor appelé la “Candescence Astrale” y est gardé.${prompt}
Right now, it looks like you can go in and have a peek.;Mais être si secret ne fait qu'attiser la curiosité des gens...${prompt}
Not that it's worth it. There's just some big pillar, with no treasure in sight...${prompt};En ce moment, on dirait que tu peux y entrer et jeter un coup d'œil.
I heard a scary-wary story-wory the other day! You see, a long time ago, the Imperial Army went to fight against the Lamiae on Arrapago Reef...${prompt};Pas que ça vaille le coup. Il n'y a juste qu'un grand pilier, sans trésor en vue...${prompt}
And they brought a whole bunchy-wunch of automatons to help them fight... I'm still shiver-wivering...${prompt};J'ai entendu une histoire effrayante il n'y a pas longtemps ! Tu vois, il y a longtemps, l'Armée Impériale est allée combattre les Lamiae sur le Récif d'Arrapago...${prompt}
But then comes the reeeally scary part. The battle automatons were charmed by the Lamiae...${prompt};Et ils ont amené toute une flopée de robots pour les aider à combattre... Ça me donne encore des frissons...${prompt}
Isn't that frighty-wightening? Every last one went crazy for the Lamiae!${prompt};Mais voici le vrai moment effrayant. Les robots de combat ont été ensorcelés par les Lamiae...${prompt}
I don't want to imagine my Truffle being crazy about anyone but me... I think my hearty-weart would just bursty-wurst!${prompt};N'est-ce pas terrifiant ? Ils étaient tous devenus fous des Lamiae !${prompt}
So I've decided to never, ever go near Arrapago Reef. Anyway, I heard Lamiae can charm Tarutaru, too!${prompt};Je n'ose pas imaginer que mon Truffle puisse devenir fou de quelqu'un d'autre que moi... Je pense que mon petit cœur éclaterait juste en morceaux !${prompt}
You better look out too, okay? It's a danger-wangerous world we live in.${prompt};Alors j'ai décidé de ne jamais, au grand jamais, m'approcher du Récif d'Arrapago. De toute façon, j'ai entendu dire que les Lamiae peuvent aussi enchanter les Tarutarus !${prompt}
Lamiae. Scary-wary.${prompt};Tu ferais mieux de faire attention aussi, d'accord ? C'est un monde dangereux dans lequel nous vivons.${prompt}
Only a joke.;Lamiae. Effrayantes.${prompt}
Truffle does not know what Lamiae are.${prompt};Juste une blague.
Empress Nashmeira II appeared at the palace seemingly out of nowhere, and now she reigns over the Empire.${prompt};Truffle ne sait pas ce que sont les Lamiae.${prompt}
Since she took the throne, not a single good thing has happened. Beastman raids are a bronze piece a dozen and nobody feels safe walking the streets of Al Zahbi anymore...${prompt};Empress Nashmeira II est apparue au palais apparemment de nulle part, et maintenant elle règne sur l'Empire.${prompt}
I have heard that she has absolutely no interest in governmental matters, as well. What is to become of our nation?${prompt};Depuis qu'elle a pris le trône, il ne s'est rien passé de bon. Les raids des bêtes sont monnaie courante et personne ne se sent en sécurité en se promenant dans les rues d'Al Zahbi...${prompt}
Until about two hundred years ago, this land belonged to a nation called the “Kingdom of Ephramad,” which prospered in the shipping trade.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire qu'elle n'avait absolument aucun intérêt pour les affaires gouvernementales. Que va devenir notre nation ?${prompt}
Trade between Ephramad and the West flourished until their tiny nation began to equal the Aht Urhgan Empire in wealth and the size of their navy.${prompt};Il y a environ deux cents ans, cette terre appartenait à une nation appelée le “Royaume d'Ephramad,” qui prospérait dans le commerce maritime.${prompt}
The rivalry between the two nations reached a critical point, and the Imperial Army used a power no man should even possess... The Kingdom of Ephramad was completely destroyed. I find the Empire's actions absolutely deplorable...${prompt};Le commerce entre Ephramad et l'Occident florissait jusqu'à ce que leur petit pays commence à rivaliser avec l'Empire Aht Urhgan en richesse et en taille de leur marine.${prompt}
My homeland, the Marquisate of Tavnazia, was destroyed in a beastman attack roughly twenty years ago. I was in Al Zahbi at the time...${prompt};La rivalité entre les deux nations a atteint un point critique, et l'Armée Impériale a utilisé un pouvoir qu'aucun homme ne devrait posséder... Le Royaume d'Ephramad a été complètement détruit. Je trouve les actions de l'Empire absolument déplorables...${prompt}
Although we were allies, the former Emperor threw the ambassador out of town without so much as a word of condolence. I have never seen such a disgrace in my entire life!${prompt};Ma patrie, le Marquisat de Tavnazia, a été détruite lors d'une attaque des bêtes il y a environ vingt ans. J'étais à Al Zahbi à l'époque...${prompt}
Since Grand Vizier Razfahd began working to restore peace on the streets of the Imperial capital, Al Zahbi has been gradually changing for the better.${prompt};Bien que nous étions alliés, l'ancien Empereur a expulsé l'ambassadeur de la ville sans même un mot de condoléances. Je n'ai jamais vu une telle honte de toute ma vie !${prompt}
The beastman invasions are still the same, but theft and other crimes have gone down. Thanks to the Grand Vizier, business is better than ever!${prompt};Depuis que le Grand Vizir Razfahd a commencé à travailler pour restaurer la paix dans les rues de la capitale impériale, Al Zahbi change progressivement pour le mieux.${prompt}
My younger brother went missing after a beastman attack once. I was sure I would never see his smiling face again...${prompt};Les invasions des bêtes sont toujours les mêmes, mais le vol et les autres crimes ont diminué. Grâce au Grand Vizir, les affaires vont mieux que jamais !${prompt}
But the other day, I got a letter from him! Would you like to hear what it says? Just listen!${prompt};Mon petit frère a disparu après une attaque des bêtes une fois. J'étais sûr de ne jamais revoir son visage souriant...${prompt}
“To my dear sister,;Mais l'autre jour, j'ai reçu une lettre de lui ! Voulez-vous entendre ce qu'elle dit ? Écoutez donc !${prompt}
Don't worry about me. The Mamool Ja are treating me like a king. I've got everything I ever wanted!${prompt};“À ma chère sœur,
“Mamook is a paradise. I'm so glad I studied blacksmithing!”${prompt};Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi. Les Mamool Ja me traitent comme un roi. J'ai tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu !${prompt}
I've decided to forget about my brother. There's just one thing I'm still curious about, though...${prompt};“Mamook est un paradis. Je suis si content d'avoir étudié la forge !”${prompt}
What is he using his blacksmithing skills to make there?${prompt};J'ai décidé d'oublier mon frère. Il y a juste une chose qui m'intrigue encore...${prompt}
Thwee cheers for the Empwess!${prompt};Que fabrique-t-il là-bas avec ses compétences de forge ?${prompt}
Don't I sound stwong? Just like an Imper-eel soldier, wight?${prompt};Thwee huzzahs pour l'Empwess !${prompt}
Imper-eels are weally cool, but Serpent Generals are even cooler!${prompt};Ne suis-je pas fowte ? Tout comme un soldat Impéwiel, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Someday I wanna see them do their magic. They can make a “seal,” you know? I don't know what that is, but I'd like to see it!${prompt};Les Impew-iiels sont weally cool, mais les Généwaux du Sèwpent sont encore plus cool !${prompt}
But whenever I twy, my papa wuns after me and dwags me back home without any supper...${prompt};Un jour, je veux les voir faire leur magie. Ils peuvent créer un “sceau,” tu sais ? Je ne sais pas ce que c'est, mais j'aimerais le voir !${prompt}
I simply cannot bring myself to like the whole idea of working as a mercenary for mere riches.${prompt};Mais chaque fois que j'essaie, mon papa me court après et me ramène à la maison sans aucun souper...${prompt}
Perhaps I am just biased, but I cannot help but feel that mercenaries lack the conviction to protect this town.${prompt};Je ne peux tout simplement pas me résoudre à aimer l'idée de travailler comme mercenaire pour de simples richesses.${prompt}
The volunteer soldiers seem very admirable in comparison. They risk their very lives to protect the town where they were raised!${prompt};Peut-être que je suis juste partial, mais je ne peux m'empêcher de sentir que les mercenaires manquent de conviction pour protéger cette ville.${prompt}
Such nice boys and girls... I'd like to bake them a pie.${prompt};Les soldats volontaires semblent très admirables en comparaison. Ils risquent leur vie pour protéger la ville où ils ont été élevés !${prompt}
Aht Urhgan, land of the courageous...${prompt};De si gentils garçons et filles... J'aimerais leur faire une tarte.${prompt}
I used to have confidence in my strength, and I came to this nation to test my skill. But you could not pay me enough to face the ferocious beastmen here...${prompt};Aht Urhgan, terre des courageux...${prompt}
Still, I can't go running home now, or everyone will think I am a coward! How do I get myself into these messes...?${prompt};J'avais autrefois confiance en ma force, et je suis venu dans cette nation pour tester mon habileté. Mais vous ne pourriez pas me payer assez pour affronter les féroces bêtes ici...${prompt}
This “Bastion” is the best place in town to stage a defensive against invading beastmen. During an attack, we retreat to this area and bring the savages down as they rush in from the drawbridges.${prompt};Pourtant, je ne peux pas rentrer chez moi maintenant, sinon tout le monde pensera que je suis un lâche ! Comment est-ce que je me mets dans ces situations... ?${prompt}
You have arrived at North Gate.;Ce “Bastion” est le meilleur endroit en ville pour organiser une défense contre les bêtes envahissantes. Pendant une attaque, nous nous retirons dans cette zone et abattons les sauvages alors qu'ils se précipitent depuis les ponts-levis.${prompt}

Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;
