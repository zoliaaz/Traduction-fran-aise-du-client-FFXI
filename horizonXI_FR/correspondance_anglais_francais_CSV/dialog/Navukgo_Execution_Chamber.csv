Long ago, I had another automaton.${prompt};
But during a battle with the Undead Swarm, the Lamiae managed to wrest it from my control and used it to inflict great damage to our army.${prompt};
A puppetmaster must be able to retain complete control over his automaton no matter the situation.${prompt};
Show me you have the strength to destroy your automaton if need be!${prompt};
You did not achieve that strength simply by defeating monsters...${prompt};
Your power comes from the inseverable bond between you and your automaton.${prompt};

I apologize.;
The more years pass by, the more I tend to think back on the past...${prompt};
While in a different manner than I expected, you passed with flying colors. Now you can walk whatever path you desire.${prompt};
But no matter what you choose to do or where you decide to travel, I have no doubt... Your automaton will always be right behind you.${prompt};
Let us begin.${prompt};
Do not underestimate my automaton's power!${prompt};
Unfortunately, it looks like you are still not ready yet...${prompt};

Gwahaha.;
(No problem for Gurfurlur!)${prompt};
He says, “Think nothing of it.”${prompt};
(My soldiers never know defeat!)${prompt};
He says, “My forces are always at your disposal.”${prompt};
Hee hee, hee hee.;
That's good to know.${prompt};
That mad puppy chased 'em down even after they had broken free from the dead realm and disguised themselves as pirates.${prompt};
Helps to have some bruisers like you on our side.${prompt};
Silence, Flit.;

Hee hee.;
Right, I'll shut up now, Boss...${prompt};
(Do not fear...;
We have same enemy.)${prompt};
(Break Empire, steal back what they stole from us.)${prompt};
He says, “If you swear to forfeit claim to the candescence on the eve of the Empire's destruction, we will honor our pact.”${prompt};
And the (treasure of the Empire), right?${prompt};
You will have both the candescence and the “treasure.”${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
We have no need for either.${prompt};
Are you sure, Boss?;
That candescence...${prompt};
Flit.;
What have I told you about the code of the corsair...?${prompt};
Absolute obedience to the captain!;
Oh...right. Shutting up again.${prompt};
Listen well.${prompt};
The Empire of Aht Urhgan...${prompt};
They will unflinchingly sacrifice their own people for the sake of the Empress...${prompt};
Eradicate any rebellion with ruthless force.${prompt};
It has always been this way.;
Then, and now...${prompt};
Our reward shall be the head of the Empress.${prompt};
That is all we require for our vengeance...${prompt};
(Is that all!? Give me ship. I destroy Empire. Take head of Empress!)${prompt};
He says, “It's a deal! I bestow upon you this special weapon to mark the occasion...”${prompt};
Well, perhaps Gurfurlur does not say that.;
But I offer this to you.;
Take it!${prompt};
Or should I say, take it with you?${prompt};
I need no weapons from you.${prompt};
You don't understand.;
This is superior to anything you possess.${prompt};
Hee hee.;
What are you tryin' to pull?${prompt};
I offer you...${prompt};
Khimaira 13!${prompt};
Khimaira...?${prompt};
What's a “khimaira”?${prompt};
You...you've never heard of a khimaira?${prompt};
There is a place...${prompt};
A secret facility known as the “Hazhalm Testing Grounds.”${prompt};
In that place, forbidden alchemy was used to fuse different species of creatures into entirely new monstrosities...${prompt};
These artificial creations are known collectively as “chimera.”;
The creature I offer to you is of the original “khimaira” type.${prompt};
Lamia, puk, merrow, hydra, mandragora...and many others beyond counting were given life there.${prompt};
It was a grand sanctuary of learning that attempted to approach the greatness of the gods themselves...${prompt};
Isn't that a great story?${prompt};
So you're saying they mashed two monsters into one?${prompt};
How come you know so much about it, Mr. Moblin?${prompt};
Why, because I've been there...${prompt};
...to steal an egg.${prompt};
Right.;
An egg...${prompt};
It might be more accurate to call it a seed of life.${prompt};
Seed...of life?${prompt};
I'm no stranger to advanced alchemy. I wanted to make my own...${prompt};
My own chimera...;
And start a business dealing in organic weapons.${prompt};
Isn't it magnificent?${prompt};
Um, the boss already left.${prompt};
He said he doesn't do business with creeps who mess with creation. Or somethin' like that.${prompt};
He what!? How could you turn down such an impressive specimen?${prompt};
(Intruders!)${prompt};
!${prompt};
What do you want?${prompt};
That's no way to greet your guests.${prompt};
We didn't come all the way down here to be treated like pests!${prompt};

No! No!${prompt};
(These people are my guests.)${prompt};

Some form of arcana...?${prompt};
You are no alchemist.;
What do you want with the egg?${prompt};
You need details for a black market trade?;
The deal is done and made.${prompt};
