They're not worth a whole lot, but ya done good to collect ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Here's ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} for yer trouble.${prompt};
Whatcha got there? Looks like ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Guess that means I gotta give you this ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Here ya go, kid. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} in exchange for ya ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Well, you make an old Gob smile, you do. Not many people hand over ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Take this ${item-singular: 2[2]} and get outta here.${prompt};
Now you're just showing off, bringing me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Here's your ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Now scram, kid.${prompt};
Whaddaya want? You wanna talk to me? Well, I don't wanna talk to you until you got something I wanna hear. Take a hike, buddy.${prompt};
I got no interest in dealing with the likes of you. Don'tcha got a home to go to?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}?;
Didn't think I'd ever hear those words from someone who wasn't a Gob. You know some weird stuff, for a person.${prompt};
There's a story that says some things have their own soul.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-plural: 2[2]} used to be just simple hourglasses. But as they passed through the hands of dozens of people, and even a few beastmen as well, the hourglasses were transformed by all their thoughts and feelings.${prompt};
They have the ability to focus mysterious powers. In our travels through all the lands of this world, us Goblins often come across this sorta thing.${prompt};
Now we come to the fun part. If you want a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}, I'd be willing to sell one to you. And you should know that only us Gobs can tell if an item has its own soul.${prompt};
You people--heck, even other beastmen--have no idea. I've seen you guys throw away these items like they were junk.${prompt};
They may look like garbage, but souled items are rare and valuable.;
You still want an hourglass, you gotta cough up ${number: 3} gil.${prompt};
${number: 1} gil for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, or ${number: 3} gil for ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
You want one, you hand me over the money.;
Like, with a quickness. So how's about it?${prompt};
What's that you got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
You're quite the collector for one o' your kind.${prompt};
It might just be a worthless piece o' junk for you, but it's priceless to us Gobs.;
If you want, I can take it off your hands for ${number: 1}.${prompt};
I add to my collection, you get some pocket change. A win-win situation, right?;
So just trade that ${item-singular: 0[2]} on over, why don't ya?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 2[2]}, ya say? Ya got my jaw dropping, kid. Where did ya hear about things like that?${prompt};
Did ya know that some items have their own soul? After passing through the hands of hundreds of people, not to mention the paws of us beastmen, some items are transformed through contact with all those thoughts and feelings.${prompt};
These transformed items have the ability to focus mysterious powers. Us Goblins often come across this weird phenenom...phemomeno...stuff in our travels.${prompt};
Ya know, if ya really want ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}, I could sell one to ya for the right price.${prompt};
But let me tell ya, kid. Only us Gobs can tell if an item is souled. Not even other beastmen--and definitely not you people--can tell the difference between normal junk and priceless artifacts.${prompt};
Makes me laugh to see you mugs throwing away those items like they was garbage.;
A souled item is worth a fortune, and ya ain't gonna get one cheap.${prompt};
${number: 3} gil, and not a single gil less! Ya got a problem with that, kid?${prompt};
So if ya want one, stop dawdlin' around already and hand me over some money.${prompt};
What's that ya got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!?;
Ya got unusual tastes for a person.${prompt};
Got no clue what ya been doin' with it, but I bet ya gots no use for it anymore.;
What say I lighten your load in exchange for, say, ${number: 1} gil?${prompt};
So whaddaya waitin' for?;
Hand that ${item-singular: 0[2]} right over and let's make a deal.${prompt};
I got a proposition for you.;
Before the Great War, a different currency was used in each of the three nations.${prompt};
But when gil became the coin of choice, all the other types of money were done away with.;
Now the old forms of currency are worthless to anyone besides a collector like me.${prompt};
You've never seen them before?;
Here, take a look at this.${prompt};
This is the least valuable type. It was part of the currency of ${choice: 7}[Bastok/Windurst].;
Since you were able to find out about the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, I'm guessing you'll be able to get your hands on a few of these.${prompt};
The three nations all had their different types of money, but I'm only interested in the old currency of ${choice: 7}[Bastok/Windurst].;
Collect enough of them and I'll trade you some other stuff I've got.${prompt};
One's not gonna be enough, though.;
You bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and I'll trade you a single ${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
You don't look real interested, but hold up. I'm just getting started.${prompt};
If you've got ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, I'll give you a ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Either that or I'll trade you for one of the goodies in my treasure hoard. They all go for a different price, however.${prompt};
The ${item-plural: 2[2]} are truly valuable. I'll give you some really great stuff for the right number of those beauties.;
You got all that? You wanna do business with me, then you better start looking.;
I'll be right here when you're ready to trade.${prompt};
I got a deal for ya, kid.;
Did ya know that before the Great War, the three nations all had their own currencies?${prompt};
After that little fracas, everyone started using gil as the standard coin, and the other types of money just faded out of existence.;
Even if you was to find any nowadays, they only have value to Goblin collectors like me.${prompt};
You're looking a bit confused there, kid.;
Let me show ya what I'm talking about.${prompt};
This one's the least valuable of the lot. It was used as a part of the San d'Orian currency years ago.;
I know I told ya about the nations all having different currencies, but these San d'Orian coins are the only ones I'm interested in.${prompt};
If ya bring me these coins, I'll exchange them for something from my secret stash of treasure. Ya won't be getting anything for just one of them, so make sure ya collect a bagful, okay?${prompt};
Let me explain the deal.;
Bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, and I'll give ya one ${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
Where're ya going? Let me finish, will ya?${prompt};
Once ya got ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, ya can trade them for one ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Or, ya can decide to exchange them for something from my treasure stash. Each item's gonna cost ya a different amount, so choose carefully.${prompt};
For the right number of ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ya can choose from among the most valuable items in my hoard. 'Course, getting enough of them to trade with is another matter...${prompt};
Hmm? Was there something you wanted to ask me?${prompt};
What is it, kid? Ya got something to ask me?${prompt};

${selection-lines};

I didn't think there were people who loved this sorta stuff as much as I do. You really understand what things are worth.;
I don't give discounts, but you're welcome back anytime.${prompt};
Ya really like your junk, huh? That's what this stuff looks like to most people, and ya just spent a fortune on it. You're my kinda people, kid.${prompt};
By the way, I don't give out receipts, and I don't take back items I already sold.;
I don't know what ya mean to do with the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and I don't much care, so take it and skedaddle.${prompt};

You got guts to come to this neck of the woods. I can see you ain't no ordinary adventurer, but you ain't the best yet, neither.;
Don't get your feathers ruffled, I just tell it like it is.${prompt};T'as du cran de venir dans ce coin-là. Je vois bien que t'es pas un aventurier ordinaire, mais t'es pas encore le meilleur non plus.
Me, I'm a blacksmith, and a damn good one. My Goblin forgecraft can make the most worthless rusty piece of junk shine like new again. Looks like you take good care of your weapons, though.${prompt};Ne te vexe pas, je dis juste les choses comme elles sont.${prompt}
You got nothing for me to work on, so this conversation is over. I got better things to do than sit here and waste time trading insults with smart-alecky adventurers. Bye-bye now.${prompt};Moi, je suis forgeron, et un foutrement bon. Mon savoir-faire gobelin peut transformer le morceau de ferraille le plus rouillé en une arme flambant neuve. On dirait que tu prends bien soin de tes armes, cela dit.${prompt}
Hold it right there, pal!;T'as rien pour moi à travailler, alors cette conversation est terminée. J'ai mieux à faire que de perdre mon temps à échanger des insultes avec des aventuriers arrogants. Allez, au revoir.${prompt}
Is that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you're carrying? The power hidden behind that worn appearance is making my old Gobbie ears twitch.;Un instant, mon pote!
Trust me, I'm a blacksmith. I don't kid around when it comes to weapons.${prompt};C'est bien ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} que tu portes? Le pouvoir caché derrière cette apparence usée me fait frémir les oreilles de Gobelin.
Hrmmm.;Crois-moi, je suis forgeron. Je plaisante pas avec les armes.${prompt}
It'd take a lotta work, but I could make that power shine through again.;
Okay, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl], you got something to write with?${prompt};Il faudrait beaucoup de travail, mais je pourrais faire ressortir ce pouvoir à nouveau.
To reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, I'm gonna need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Yep, that's the bare minimum.${prompt};D'accord, ${choice-player-gender}[aventurier/aventurière], t’as de quoi écrire?${prompt}
Bring along the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with those three items and I'll get to work for you.;Pour reforger le ${item-singular: 0[2]}, je vais avoir besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Oui, c’est le strict minimum.${prompt}
I've told you what I need, the rest is up to you.${prompt};Apporte-moi le ${item-singular: 0[2]} avec ces trois objets et je me mettrai au travail pour toi.
You got me what I need? Lemme see here, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Good work.;Je t'ai dit ce qu'il me faut, maintenant c'est à toi de jouer.${prompt}
Did I mention that I don't work for free? I'm gonna need a little something up front--don't trust you sneaky adventurer-types.${prompt};Tu m'as apporté ce dont j'ai besoin? Voyons voir, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Bon travail.
Oh, and I got no interest in gil. My fee for this job is ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. You people pay each other for stuff all the time, right? Well, this ain't no different. You pay my fee, your weapon gets fixed up.${prompt};Ai-je mentionné que je ne travaille pas gratuitement? Je vais avoir besoin d'un petit quelque chose d'avance--je ne fais pas confiance à vous autres aventuriers sournois.${prompt}
Reforging the ${item-singular: 0[2]} is gonna cost you ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. You pay me and I start working. See you when you get back with my fee.${prompt};Oh, et l'argent ne m'intéresse pas. Mon tarif pour ce travail est de ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. Vous vous payez entre vous pour tout et n'importe quoi, non? Eh bien, ce n'est pas différent. Vous payez mon tarif, votre arme est réparée.${prompt}
You brought me my ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}? Right, time to get to work. My forge is hot and ready to go.${prompt};Reforger le ${item-singular: 0[2]} va te coûter ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Tu me paies et je commence à travailler. On se voit quand tu reviendras avec mon paiement.${prompt}
The Goblin way of smithing is a little different from your fancy-schmancy “synthesis.” I'm gonna need some time to get this job done. You kept me waiting for the materials I needed, now it's your turn to cool your heels for a while. Fair's fair, right?${prompt};Tu m’as apporté mes ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}? D’accord, il est temps de se mettre au travail. Ma forge est chaude et prête à l’emploi.${prompt}
You back already? I told you this was gonna take some time. You adventurer-types have really gotta learn some patience.;"La forge gobeline est un peu différente de votre ""synthèse"" sophistiquée. Je vais avoir besoin de temps pour faire ce travail. Tu m'as fait attendre pour les matériaux dont j'avais besoin, maintenant c'est ton tour de patienter un peu. C'est juste, non?${prompt}"
Let me get back to work, will ya? Sheesh.${prompt};Tu es déjà de retour? Je t'ai dit que ça allait prendre du temps. Vous autres aventuriers devez vraiment apprendre la patience.
You can stop your bellyachin' now--I'm done with your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. So what do you think? You ain't gonna see too many weapons of this quality, I can tell you. Be seeing you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};Laisse-moi retourner au travail, veux-tu? Zut.${prompt}
Oh yeah, one more thing: the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I worked on can still be improved. I can make that power shine even brighter than before. Do I have your full attention, now?;Tu peux arrêter de te plaindre maintenant--j'ai fini avec ton ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Alors, qu'en penses-tu? Tu ne verras pas beaucoup d'armes de cette qualité, je peux te le dire. À la prochaine, ${choice-player-gender}[aventurier/aventurière].${prompt}
Naturally, it's gonna cost you.${prompt};Oh oui, encore une chose : le ${item-singular: 0[2]} sur lequel j'ai travaillé peut encore être amélioré. Je peux faire ressortir ce pouvoir encore plus qu'avant. Est-ce que j'ai toute ton attention maintenant?
The weapons you people use are really popular among the beastmen these days. I could make myself a small fortune with just a few of them.${prompt};Naturellement, ça va te coûter.${prompt}
The top sellers at the moment are ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]}. There are others I could think of, but those three bring in the most cash. Don't forget to bring the ${item-singular: 0[2]} back with you, too.${prompt};Les armes que vous utilisez sont vraiment populaires chez les hommes-bêtes ces jours-ci. Je pourrais faire fortune avec seulement quelques-unes d'entre elles.${prompt}
Those three items cover the cost of materials for reforging the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, but I'm still gonna ask you for a separate fee for my sweat and toil. To forge, or not to forge? The answer is in your hands.${prompt};Les articles les plus vendus en ce moment sont ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, et ${item-plural: 3[2]}. Il y en a d'autres auxquels je pourrais penser, mais ces trois-là rapportent le plus d'argent. N'oublie pas d'apporter aussi le ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Oho, you brought me what I asked for? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. My pockets are gonna be bulging when I unload this stuff, heh heh.${prompt};Ces trois objets couvrent le coût des matériaux pour reforger le ${item-singular: 0[2]}, mais je vais quand même te demander un tarif séparé pour mon travail. Reforger ou ne pas reforger? La réponse est entre tes mains.${prompt}
Now about that fee. As a craftsgoblin, it's embarrassin' to admit, but I don't think I can reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you. There's a blacksmith I know who can do the job, though. Damn expensive, but the best blacksmith I ever saw.${prompt};Oho, tu m’as apporté ce que j’ai demandé? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Mes poches vont être pleines quand je vais revendre tout ça, heh heh.${prompt}
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};Maintenant à propos de ce tarif. En tant qu’artisan gobelin, c'est embarrassant à admettre, mais je ne pense pas pouvoir reforger le ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour toi. Il y a un forgeron que je connais qui peut faire le travail, mais il est sacrément cher, le meilleur forgeron que j'aie jamais vu.${prompt}
I don't have the skill to reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you gave me, so I'm gonna take it to a blacksmith friend of mine. It'll be expensive, but the work is topnotch.${prompt};Le tarif, incluant ma part pour la recommandation, s’élève à ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. Ça va être amusant de voir comment tu vas mettre tes sales petites mains d'aventurier sur le butin, mais le résultat en vaudra la peine.${prompt}
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};Je n’ai pas les compétences pour reforger le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu m’as donné, donc je vais l’apporter à un ami forgeron. Ce sera cher, mais le travail sera de la plus haute qualité.${prompt}
It's tough even for us Gobs to collect ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and you've brought me ${number: 2} of them. Not bad for a clueless adventurer-type. Leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me and the job will get done.${prompt};Le tarif, incluant ma part pour la recommandation, s’élève à ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Ça va être amusant de voir comment tu vas mettre tes sales petites mains d’aventurier sur le butin, mais le résultat en vaudra la peine.${prompt}
You really are impatient, ain't you!;C’est difficile même pour nous, les Gobs, de collecter ${item-plural: 1[2]}, et tu m’en as apporté ${number: 2}. Pas mal pour un aventurier sans cervelle. Laisse-moi le ${item-singular: 0[2]} et le travail sera fait.${prompt}
This is gonna take a hell of a lot longer than last time--that's how amazing the outcome is gonna be. Better find something else to occupy yourself with for a while.${prompt};T'es vraiment impatient, hein !
This is gonna take so long, you'll forget you even asked me to do it in the first place. A really, really, really long time. Really long. But don't worry, I'm a true craftsgoblin, I won't go back on a deal. Just don't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};Ça va prendre bien plus de temps que la dernière fois--c'est à quel point le résultat va être incroyable. Tu ferais mieux de trouver autre chose à faire en attendant.${prompt}
And here you go, the finished masterpiece. Really, really, really sorry to keep you waiting so long. Really sorry. But take a look. Feel this radiating power. I bet you're glad you didn't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};Ça va prendre tellement de temps que tu oublieras même m'avoir demandé de le faire. Un temps vraiment, vraiment, vraiment long. Vraiment long. Mais ne t'inquiète pas, je suis un vrai forgeron gobelin, je ne reviendrai pas sur un accord. N'oublie juste pas de revenir, hein?${prompt}
This reforging stuff just warms my old Gobbie heart. You find any more old weapons, be sure to bring them to me. You never know, they might have the same potential for enhancement you see here. See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};Et voilà, le chef-d'œuvre terminé. Désolé de t'avoir fait attendre si longtemps. Vraiment désolé. Mais regarde ça. Ressens ce pouvoir qui émane de cette arme. Je parie que tu es content de ne pas avoir oublié de revenir, hein?${prompt}
You can now request Switchstix to reforge a second ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Cette reforgerie, ça me réchauffe le cœur de vieux Gobelin. Si tu trouves d'autres vieilles armes, n'hésite pas à me les apporter. On ne sait jamais, elles pourraient avoir le même potentiel d'amélioration que celle-ci. À la prochaine, ${choice-player-gender}[aventurier/aventurière].${prompt}
Hold on, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]. I remember you...;Tu peux maintenant demander à Switchstix de reforger une deuxième ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
That ${item-singular: 0[2]} you've got there. Didn't I already reforge one for you?${prompt};Attends une seconde, ${choice-player-gender}[aventurier/aventurière]. Je me souviens de toi...
Don't tell me you want another...;Ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu as là. Je ne t'en ai pas déjà reforgé un?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Ne me dis pas que tu en veux un autre...
I do!;
No. Just forget it.${prompt};Oui !
Hmmm...;Non. Oublie ça.${prompt}
Hmmm......;
You know you can only carry one of those things, right?${prompt};
Let me get this straight. You want another, even though you know you can only carry one... And you people say us Gobbies are weird.;Tu sais que tu ne peux porter qu'un seul de ces trucs, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
Well, you know the routine. Bring me back the items and I'll start forging.${prompt};Laisse-moi voir si j'ai bien compris. Tu en veux un autre, même si tu sais que tu ne peux en porter qu'un seul... Et vous dites que nous, les Gobs, sommes bizarres.
===Weapon Reforging in Progress===;Eh bien, tu connais la routine. Ramène-moi les objets et je commencerai à forger.${prompt}
Still ${number: 2} days and ${number: 1} hours until completion.;===Reforgerie d'Arme en Cours===
Weapon in the forge: ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Encore ${number: 2} jours et ${number: 1} heures jusqu'à l'achèvement.
“Trade” the ${item-singular: 6[2]} to the “Hieroglyphics” found in each area. The ${item-singular: 6[2]} will be transformed into ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};Arme dans la forge: ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
From that point on, one of the areas of Dynamis will be reserved by the bearer of the ${item-singular: 7[2]}. The destination and time to be spent in Dynamis will be recorded in the help text of the ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
By defeating certain enemies, a group can extend the amount of time they are allowed in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia]. Any time extensions will be reflected in the ${item-singular: 7[2]}'s help text.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 7[2]} creates a copy. By handing these copies out to other characters, it is possible to enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] in large groups.${prompt};
The number of characters that can enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] at one time is limited to ${number: 4} people.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 7[2]} can be duplicated further by those who have received a copy, essentially allowing for an unlimited number of ${item-plural: 7[2]} to be made. However, the moment the maximum allowable number of players have entered Dynamis, all extra hourglasses will become void. Please take this into consideration when deciding to whom, and how many, copies are to be handed out.${prompt};
To warp to Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], “Trade” the ${item-singular: 7[2]} to the “Hieroglyphics” where you originally received it.${prompt};
Please note that it is not possible to enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] without ${keyitem-article: 5[2]}, even if you trade the required ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
In addition, only players above level 64 can travel to the Shrouded Land.${prompt};
Ensuring that you have ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} in your possession, seek out the “Trail Markings” or “Hieroglyphics” found in each area.${prompt};
Examine them and you will be granted entrance to the corresponding Dynamis area.${prompt};
Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] will not be reserved to anyone. It will be accessible to any and all who meet the entry requirements.${prompt};
Your stay in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] will be subject to a time restriction. Parties will automatically be expelled from the area when this time elapses.${prompt};
Parties and alliances can extend their duration of stay by defeating certain enemies.${prompt};
Please note that it is not possible to enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] without ${keyitem-article: 5[2]}, even if you trade the required ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Remember that only players level 65 or above can travel to the Shrouded Land.${prompt};
Furthermore, it is not possible to reserve Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] using ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Even if you leave Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] through magic or being KO'd, you can reenter the same area without restriction as long as it is within the designated time of the ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
However, you will be in a weakened state for some time upon returning to Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia].${prompt};
This weakened state will last for longer than the usual period experienced after being raised from KO status.${prompt};
Upon entering Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], you will be unable to reenter using a different ${item-singular: 7[2]} for ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[day/days] (Earth time).${prompt};
In addition to Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], this restriction will also apply to the following Dynamis areas:${prompt};

Travel to Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] is limited to once per ${choice: 1}[day/ten minutes] (Earth time).${prompt};
Even if expelled from the area by magic or being KO'd, you will not be able to reenter until the waiting period has elapsed.${prompt};
In addition to Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], this restriction will also apply to other Dynamis areas.${prompt};

In Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], it is possible to cooperate with other characters to defeat enemies without being in the same party or alliance.${prompt};
Also, items dropped by enemies become available for every character in the area to cast lots on. As in normal parties, the item is gained by the character who casts the highest lot.${prompt};
Please be aware that items not lotted for within the restricted time may go to random characters or be lost entirely.${prompt};
Starting from when the first character enters, if the number of people in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] reaches and remains at zero for approximately ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[minute/minutes] (Earth time), the time and area designation on the ${item-singular: 7[2]} will be canceled.${prompt};
When battling enemies in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], it will only be possible to cooperate with characters in the same party or alliance.${prompt};
Spoils dropped by enemies will become available for every character in the party or alliance to cast lots on. The item will be awarded to the character who casts the highest lot.${prompt};
Please be aware that items not lotted for within the restricted time may go to a random party or alliance member, or be lost entirely.${prompt};
I'll exchange you ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]} for a ${item-singular: 0[2]}. They're worth a bunch, so don't go giving 'em away.${prompt};
Ya can also exchange a ${item-singular: 0[2]} for ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Gonna take ya a while to find, kid. Hope you're patient.${prompt};
Alrighty, ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]} in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Here's ya ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, and I get ta pocket the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Hey, you're the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal] with the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, right?;
I got some good news for you.${prompt};
Got a letter here from my blacksmith buddy, the guy who forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Wanted me to lay a proposition on you.${prompt};
For years now, him and his mates have been digging tunnels right under this place we're standin' on. Even among us Goblins, they're considered a strange crew.${prompt};
They're lookin' for a certain object that was buried here thousands of millions of years ago, or something like that. But don't worry your little head over whatever that may be.${prompt};
Anywho, after poking around deep under the earth for so long, they've come across a few strange weapons used by Gob-knows-who, Gob-knows-when.${prompt};
Now, this is the good part. The weapons those guys found happen to have the same sorta aura as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you're toting around. Pretty intriguing stuff, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
My buddy mentioned in his letter that he'd be willing to trade his discovery for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, as long as you throw ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into the bargain.${prompt};
Wait a sec...${item-singular: 1[2]}?;
Can't say I've ever heard of it myself. No description in the letter about it neither.${prompt};
Hrmmm. Guess if you want to swap your ${item-singular: 0[2]} for what they dug up, you better start looking for ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
Okay, I've done my bit and told you what you gotta do. It's adventure-time again.${prompt};
So this is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?;
Huh. I been all over the place and seen lotsa bizzaro stuff, but this is the first time I've seen something like this.;
You sure you're not a Gob?${prompt};
Righto, I'll take this stuff off your hands and we can get down to my favorite subject: extra fees. This one's really gonna cost you.;
Cha-ching! That'll be ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}, please!${prompt};
Collecting this sum is gonna be tough. Incredibly, unbelievably, ridiculously difficult. But I got faith in you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]!${prompt};
Your fee this time around is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}.${prompt};
My buddies are gonna hear about this--${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}! You shoulda been born a Gob!;
You can leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me.${prompt};
You ain't learned any patience on your travels, have you? And no, I'm not gonna tell some blabbermouth adventurer where my buddy hangs out.;
Look, I didn't cheat you last time, did I? Give a Gob a break and stop bothering me every five seconds!${prompt};
Oh, and you should be happy. There's no reforging to do, so this won't take nearly half as long as last time. Don't get so involved in your little adventures that you forget all about it, though.${prompt};
Good timing, your package has arrived. Definitely looks a lot like what you had in the first place...;
Hmmm. You're probably thinking this isn't worth the loot you had to part with, huh?${prompt};
Cheer up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].;
And don't forget to keep bringing me those ancient weapons. Who knows? They might be hiding some secret power that only a blacksmith like me can draw out.;
Here's what you came for.${prompt};
You hear a voice from somewhere...${prompt};
The voice has gone silent...${prompt};
What's up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]?;
You get my attention, then you don't say anything. Are you feeling okay? You're acting kinda weird.;
I'm a blacksmith, not a doctor, you know.${prompt};
Whachya got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}?;
I told you to bring me any old weapons you find, but try to make sure they're in one piece, huh? ${prompt};
Doesn't matter how great a blacksmith I am, there's not much I can do with just ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}. Sometimes knowing when to give up takes more guts, as my old Gobbie granddaddy used to say.${prompt};
...;
Are you searching for me?${prompt};
Are you the one who is searching for me?;
Then prove it through your actions...${prompt};
My body will be made from ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. You will also need to prepare ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Once these things are gathered, come to the fortress built by the avians. There is a courtyard within...;
Do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};
If you do all this, I will show myself to you. I will be waiting...${prompt};
...;
Do you wish to possess me?${prompt};
Are you the one who wishes to possess me?;
Then show me the proof of your zeal.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my graceful form, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to be my flawless soul. And ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} will be my bond.${prompt};
Bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and these tokens to the forbidden forest in the east, to the base of the great tree that towers above all.${prompt};
Only then will your eyes behold my beauty.;
Until that day...${prompt};
...;
Dost thou need my power at thy side?${prompt};
Art thou the one who seeks my power?;
Then show me the strength of thine will.${prompt};
Seek thee out ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to be my spirit, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my physical form. And to buy my indulgence, ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Bring these baubles and the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the holy spring in the lair of the true dragon.${prompt};
And then shalt thou behold my true form...${prompt};
...;
Are you the one who has called upon me?${prompt};
Are you the one who desires my power?;
Do you seek the means to end the world?${prompt};
Then I will have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my flesh, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to unbind my spirit. And I demand of you ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Take these offerings to the chasm of the land encased in ice, and seek out the water that lies at its end.;
Do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
Your efforts will be rewarded with a power beyond anything you have ever possessed.${prompt};
...;
You, wield me?${prompt};
You, want wield me?;
Me? Me hunger.;
You, bring. Me, sated.${prompt};
Me, body, strong axe, ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Me, heart, ${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
Me, value, ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
You, bring, me.;
South...? West...?;
Sand, much, island. Rock? Mountain?${prompt};
You, come?;
You, no forget bring ${item-singular: 4[2]}.;
You, be master, me.${prompt};
...;
You wish to see me?${prompt};
You wish to see the splendid hero sung of in legend?;
Then prove your love to me.${prompt};
I require the weapon, ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
I seek to possess ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
I desire the wealth of ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Gather my demands along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and venture upon the grand bridge, to the garden at the top of the tower.${prompt};
There I will grant you audience in all my glory.${prompt};
...;
Heh heh heh, you need me now, don't you?${prompt};
Whether it be fortune or disaster, your steps unwittingly lead you to me.;
You have approached the forbidden border...${prompt};
Very well.;
You will bring a weapon, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, to serve as my material shell. And ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} liberated from Dynamis, as well as ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Once you have all these things, thrust them into the great waterfall along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. You know the place I speak of?${prompt};
If you accomplish this feat, I will recognize you as my wielder.${prompt};
...;
You have been looking for me?;
For Odin's spear, the incarnation of lightning...?${prompt};
Do not try to hide your desire.;
You seek a force that topples armies, triumphs against sorcery, and approaches the power of the gods...${prompt};
A wise choice.;
First, seek ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Second, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a lance of unsurpassed quality, to act as my earthly manifestation. Lastly, you will bring me ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Take these along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and seek me out in the city in the clouds.${prompt};
If you succeed in discovering my decaying remains, I will see fit to realize your desire.${prompt};
...;
Am I the one you seek?${prompt};
If you do indeed wish to find me, I will ask of you an arduous task.${prompt};
As my blade I will have you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. And to guide my soul to that blade, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I also wish of you a bounty of ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Bring these things to the southeastern island, to the place where the bandits dwell. An old box will be the object of your search. Do not forget to bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
If you discover my resting place, I shall willingly fly to your side.${prompt};
...;
Am I the object of your search?${prompt};
Do you scour the land for my presence?${prompt};
Then gather unto yourself ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for my soul, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to be the cage to hold it. And I demand of you ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
You are to offer these to me, along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]}, on the peak of the mountain that looms above the forest and the city of knights.${prompt};
Then shall I willingly enter your service.${prompt};
Do you seek my strength?${prompt};
I am mightier than you could ever imagine.;
You seem powerful already. Do you still seek to possess that which is stronger?${prompt};
Very well.;
You will find me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to be my body, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to complement my soul. And you will offer me ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have these in your possession, take the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and venture deep into the forbidden forest. Look for the shining stone.${prompt};
I await your coming...${prompt};
...;
So, you are searching for me?${prompt};
I am the key to the gate of hell.;
And yet you search for me? Do not try to deny it.${prompt};
If you wish to wield my forbidden power, then bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a staff of uncommon craftsmanship.${prompt};
You will also require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} to free me from my chains.;
Do not forget to bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
This task will be harder than you believe. But if you succeed in gathering these things, bring them to the island overgrown with jungle, to the place that lies closest to the infernal flames.${prompt};
Once you have accomplished this, my unearthly power will be yours.${prompt};
...;
Do you quest for me?${prompt};
I knew it to be so.;
I was once the bow of a famous archer, but have since passed through many hands to my present masterless state.${prompt};
If you would draw me in battle, then I must have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a great bow, to be my foundation. You will also require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have these in hand, bring them with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the beach of the land to the west and the south.${prompt};
I will be waiting for you.${prompt};
...;
You are the one who hunts for me?${prompt};
You are aware of my reputation for destruction?${prompt};
If you still intend to own me, then I will have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a weapon suitable to serve as my barrel. And I will have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} as further recompense.${prompt};
Once you have what I require, you will find me in the southwestern nation where the children who play with fire reside.;
And do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
I will be waiting.${prompt};
...;
Do you wish to play a tune with me?${prompt};
If you wish to hear my strident call, then you must collect my pieces.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is my bold timbre, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will provide my body. And my music must be paid for with ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have the parts I require, take up the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and come to the valley in the west where the wind blows its own symphony.${prompt};
Then I will break my silence for you...${prompt};
Good timing, your package has arrived. The letter mentioned something about the weapons being really similar, but I can see a few differences myself.;
Hmmm. You're probably thinking this isn't worth the loot you had to part with, huh?${prompt};Bien tombé, ton paquet est arrivé. La lettre mentionnait que les armes se ressemblaient beaucoup, mais je peux voir quelques différences moi-même.
Third Stage/Reforge Complete;Hmmm. Tu te dis probablement que ça ne valait pas le butin que tu as dû lâcher, hein?${prompt}
Reforge of ${item-singular: 0[2]} complete.;Troisième étape/Refonte terminée
Now you have a new toy: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}${prompt};Refonte de ${item-singular: 0[2]} terminée.
Did I mention I fix up armor and shields as well?;Maintenant tu as un nouveau jouet: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}${prompt}
You wanna impress your friends with an old relic that shines like new, you know who to ask!${prompt};J'ai mentionné que je répare aussi les armures et les boucliers?
Wait up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventurer-boy/adventurer-girl]!;Si tu veux impressionner tes amis avec une vieille relique qui brille comme neuve, tu sais à qui demander!${prompt}
My Gobbie blacksmith instincts are telling me that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is hiding some real potential.${prompt};Attends, ${choice-player-gender}[aventurier/aventurière]!
Hrmmm. Hrmmm.;Mon instinct de forgeron gobelin me dit que ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} cache un véritable potentiel.${prompt}
It'll take a lotta work to put it back in shape, but this is the kinda thing I live for.;
Right, get your notebook ready.${prompt};Ça va demander beaucoup de travail pour le remettre en forme, mais c'est le genre de chose que j'adore.
I don't work for that gil you adventurer-types love to hoard.;Bien, prends ton carnet de notes.${prompt}
What I'm gonna need is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Better throw in ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and don't forget ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};Je ne travaille pas pour ce gil que vous autres aventuriers aimez tant accumuler.
That's my fee.;Ce dont j'ai besoin, c'est de ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Il vaudrait mieux ajouter ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, et n'oublie pas ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt}
You gotta problem with fair trade? You pay me, I fix up your stuff.${prompt};C'est mon tarif.
My fee for reforging your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};T'as un problème avec le commerce équitable? Tu me payes, je répare tes affaires.${prompt}
You pay me and I start working. See you when you get back with my fee.${prompt};
You got what I asked for? I count ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}. Looks like it's all here.${prompt};
Right, time to get to work. My forge is hot and ready to go.${prompt};
You can stop your bellyachin' now--I'm done with your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. So what do you think? You ain't gonna see too many pieces of this quality, I can tell you. Be seeing you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
Oh yeah, one more thing: the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I worked on can still be improved. I can make that power shine even brighter than before. Do I have your full attention, now?;
Naturally, it's gonna cost you.${prompt};
The armor and shields you people use are really popular among the beastmen these days. I could make myself a small fortune with just a few pieces.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Plus ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and while we're at it, ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Plus ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
It's tough even for us Gobs to get our hands on this old currency. Not bad for a clueless adventurer-type. Leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me and the job will get done.${prompt};
And here you go, the finished masterpiece. Really, really, really sorry to keep you waiting so long. Really sorry. But take a look. Feel this radiating power. I bet you're glad you didn't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};
This reforging stuff just warms my old Gobbie heart. You find any more old armor or shields, be sure to bring them to me. You never know, they might have the same potential for enhancement you see here. See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
Got a letter here from my blacksmith buddy, the guy who forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Wanted me to lay a proposition on you.${prompt};
Anywho, after poking around deep under the earth for so long, they've come across a few strange bits of armor used by Gob-knows-who, Gob-knows-when.${prompt};
Now, this is the good part. The armor and shields those guys found happen to have the same sorta aura as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you're toting around. Pretty intriguing stuff, wouldn't you say?${prompt};

I'm gonna hit you up for ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};

My buddies are gonna hear about this. Look at all this loot! You shoulda been born a Gob!;
You can leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me.${prompt};

Here's what you came for.${prompt};
Whachya got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}?;
I told you to bring me any old armor or shields you find, but try to make sure they're in one piece, huh? ${prompt};
...You wish me to protect you?${prompt};
You seek an impenetrable wall with which to defend yourself and your companions?;
I will be that shield for you.${prompt};
However...;
You must provide ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for my impervious foundation.${prompt};
You will also require ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} as a sign of good faith.${prompt};
Bring these along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the place by the channel where my wise servant rests his wings.${prompt};
If this is done, I will pledge to you an unshakable defense--a shield upon which the claws of fiends will break, and the finest blades will shatter...${prompt};
You pay the fee--we got a deal.;
I'll be here waiting for you, trying to keep my Gobbie toes warm.${prompt};
What's that, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]?;
You wanna cancel the order? Have you lost your little adventurer mind!?${prompt};
I keeps what I takes, and you loses what you gives, you get it?;
No refunds, ifs, ands, or buts.${prompt};
