${choice: 0}[Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!];
It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
Why, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!${prompt};
I wish you speed upon your journey.${prompt};
You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.${prompt};
Come back when you have the requisite certification.${prompt};
Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.${prompt};
Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?;
Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt};
The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt};
Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt};
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};
You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt};
In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt};
One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt};
Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt};
The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt};
You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt};
There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt};
The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt};
When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt};
A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt};
The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt};
I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt};
Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of ${number: 0} imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt};
It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt};
The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt};
The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt};
We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt};
The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt};
The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt};
We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt};
Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt};
The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt};
Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt};
We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt};
Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt};
The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt};
It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt};
Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number ${number: 1}.${prompt};

Behavioral research.;

Nothing.${prompt};
Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt};
It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt};
The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt};
Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt};
If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt};
While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt};
Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt};
For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt};
Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt};
You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt};
By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt};
The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt};
Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt};
Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt};
The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt};
Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt};
The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt};
The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt};
While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt};
Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt};
This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt};
Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt};
The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt};
Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt};
This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt};

鋭いとげがある蔦だ…。${prompt};
The Velkk have a strong presence here. My job is to keep them out of our affairs.${prompt};
If only there was a registered pioneer with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} that I could count on--then my job would be easier by malms.${prompt};
Hold there, pioneer--I'm in need of your aid. Have you ever had the misfortune of squaring off against a Velkk?${prompt};
Foul beasts, those. Stinky and violent, with an unpredictable streak at that. Maybe a bit stupid, but it's only a matter of time before they turn their spears to Adoulin.${prompt};
That's why the coalitions put me here to “keep an eye on them”...and I've noticed something startling.${prompt};
They're able to use the ivy that snakes along the side of the cliffs here in Marjami Ravine to scale vertical walls, enabling them to move almost effortlessly from place to place!${prompt};
I figured that if those brutes can do it, it can't be too hard, right? But the ivy is covered with all manner of thorns and briars, making climbing an exercise in futility.${prompt};
"And then something came to me; what if we could make gloves out of the hides they use? Then we could keep our hands safe for sure.${prompt}";
I assume I don't have to spell this out, but just in case--I want you to raid one of their encampments and “procure” some of their leather.${prompt};
On multiple occasions I've seen leather scraps strewn about the outskirts of the encampment of theirs to the southwest.${prompt};
This'll be a dangerous task, to be sure, but I'm sure you've seen worse during your extensive travels of the Middle Lands.${prompt};
I'd go myself, but I've been commanded to stay at this post--so help a Galka out, will you?${prompt};
The Velkk process most of their leather in an encampment to the southwest. I'd bet my tunic that you'll find some quality material there.${prompt};
If I'm right, we'll be able to craft us some gloves that'll let us climb the ivy ourselves.${prompt};
The thorns should pose no issue then. So get out there and bring me back that hide!${prompt};
Leather scraps are strewn about the ground.${prompt};
You're back! Did you get what I asked for?${wait-36: 1};
Yes, this is some high-quality leather.${prompt};
Soft to the touch, yet firm and resilient. No wonder they were able to climb that ivy like you or I would climb rope!${prompt};
I'll just have to make us a couple of pairs of gloves out of this and we'll be scaling the cliffs in no time!${prompt};
Talk about perfect! Udip Ferawoh said she'd take over my post for a little bit in case I needed a break--which I'll use to give this another go!${prompt};
I've got to make some preparations first, though.${prompt};
You interested in coming, too? Once I'm ready, I'll be heading off to the southwest of here, where the closest patch of ivy grows. Maybe I'll see you there.${prompt};
I'm going to try my hand at climbing the ivy again now that I can make those gloves. If you've got a spare moment, I'd like for you to be there, too.${prompt};
The closest place to try them out is southwest of here. By Altana, this is going to be quite the ride!${prompt};
Owwwwww...gaaah!;
${name-player}! Don't just stand there, help me outta here!${prompt};
Oh, this is just great. Now we're both stuck in this cursed hole.${prompt};
What's that?;
Yeah, I know we should have been able to climb the ivy with these gloves.${prompt};
I figured that all I needed to do was fashion a pair out of the leather you gave me and then just grab on...${prompt};
...But things are never that simple, are they?;
Think you can give me a boost?${prompt};
Ooof... Ow ow ow!${prompt};
We made a little bit of progress, I suppose...but I need to be able to do this alone.${prompt};
Wait--I've got an idea. Can you stand a couple steps back and watch carefully as I give it another go? Maybe you'll be able to see what I'm doing wrong.${prompt};
Owww... Not again...<cough>;
I-I think I know what I'm doing wrong, but my back...I think I threw it out <wince>.;
Here, put these gloves on and see if you can't do better than I did.${prompt};
Hmm...maybe the problem is that we're too focused on our hands. What if we used our toes to grope about for a sturdy place to anchor ourselves?${prompt};
You've also got better balance than I do. Give it another go.${prompt};
Great job, ${name-player}! You figured out how to do it!${prompt};
Take those gloves with you, free of charge--they're bound to come in handy.${prompt};
Watching the way you expertly clawed your way out of here gave me the confidence to have another crack at it.${prompt};
I'll be able to climb those rocks as deftly as you once I put on a bit more muscle.${prompt};
Feel free to head back to camp, or to continue with your pioneering activities--I'll claw my way out of here somehow. Best of luck, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Putting those skills you learned in that Goddessforsaken hole to good use? Must come in handy during your treks around Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt};
I know that I've got a ways to go--but I'll get there someday.${prompt};
Isn't this just wonderrrful? First the Velkk get in my way, and now thorn-covered ivy. The thought of those two together makes my fur stand on end.${prompt};
Speaking of those beasts, keep your claws sharrrp. They've been known to wander up to the station from time to time.${prompt};
Those cursed Velkk, always showing up to rrruin a good time.${prompt};
If only you had ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you might be able to lend a girrrl a hand...${prompt};
You there, pioneer! You may have your paws full with some colonization prrroject or other, but I've got a small task for you.${prompt};
No doubt you're familiar with the brrrutishness of the Velkk--but the ones here are a bit smarter than the rest.${prompt};
Not only do they assault us with weapons and spells, but these annoyances even plant spinescent protuberances to impede our prrrogress!${prompt};
One of the things damn near tore my tail to shrrreds! We've got to do something about it!${prompt};
I rrresearched as much as I could, but there's a limit to how much can be done by myself.${prompt};
My team suggested that since pioneers make a living going against the forces of nature, maybe we could hire one to deal with this prrrickly issue.${prompt};
I know this idea must sound like claws scrrratching against metal, but I want you to suffer an amnesic attack from one of those things.${prompt};
Did I say “an” amnesic attack? Because I meant five. That should do the trrrick.${prompt};
Pioneers are grrreat for doing my dirty...I mean helping out those in need. In this case, what I need is for you to learn more about spinescent protuberances.${prompt};
Suffer five amnesic attacks from those things and then come back here. Come on--what's the worrrst that could happen?${prompt};
You feel you have learned all you can from the spinescent protuberances.${prompt};
Report back to Udip Ferawoh with your findings.${prompt};
How did everything go? Do you rrremember who I am? More importantly, do you remember who you are?${prompt};
Hoho, that was a little joke. But better you see me in that state than those Velkk, hmm?${prompt};
So tell me--what have you learrrned?${prompt};
Hey, Udip! What kind of sick mind do you have to make this ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] do your dangerous research for you?${prompt};
C'mon, we've got to clean our friend up!${prompt};
What odd wounds... You say you got them from the protuberances, right?${prompt};
Hmm, hmm. Interesting. We've seen Velkk hide with similar markings.${prompt};
But that would be Trrree's specialty, wouldn't it?${prompt};
Currriouser and currriouser. Do you suppose the Velkk have a habit of falling into their own traps?${prompt};
You betaru! Those protuberances don't care who gets close. They're equal opportunity assailants!${prompt};
Orsa-Porsa!${prompt};
I leave you alone for two minutarus, and just look at these juicy tidbits you dig up!${prompt};
And now here we are, your eyes glintaruing like you want to ask something of the master Velkk researcher.${prompt};
Well, since you're here...;
Have you ever seen a Velkk get caught in one of their own trrraps?${prompt};
You betaru your life! With my own two eyes!${prompt};
I saw one with his eyes blinking faster than a heartwing flapping its, err...wings! And a spiky vine was wrappy-wapped around his legs! You should've seen the jig he was dancing!${prompt};
Nyah-hah! That must be how they free themselves from the spinescent prrrotuberances!${prompt};
Hey, O-P, you gotta tell us these things up front! Just what was he doing?${prompt};
It went something like this...!${prompt};
Wow, to think I'd ever get to bear witness to such a rrremarkable display of dancing prowess! And he made it look so easy, too. Right, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Now those pesky protuberances will be nothing more than a small bump in the rrroad of progress!${prompt};
And what's more, we've got you to thank for this breakthrrrough. Much obliged!${prompt};
Hey, it's ${name-player}!;
Thank you again for showing us how to handle those spinescent prrrotuberances.${prompt};
It'll be easy trrrekking from here on out!${prompt};
How quaint. A stranger in these lands, without so much as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to prove ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] worth. Begone until you have procured the requisite authentication.${prompt};
A registered pioneer you may be, but I have never heard so much as a peep about your exploits. Begone, wanderer, and find one with less critical tasks to give you.${prompt};
${name-player}, is it not? Yes, tales of your exploits have reached my ears. I, Veldeth, am the Peacekeepers' eyes and ears here in Marjami Ravine.${prompt};
I have a special coalition assignment direct from the Peacekeepers for one as storied as yourself.${prompt};
I require that you secure Velkk equipment to prove that you have helped cement our operations in this area. A total of ${number: 2} ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]} should suffice.${prompt};
Our objective is to weaken their fighting capabilities so that they cease to be a threat to the colonization effort. I care not by what means you obtain these accouterments, but vanquishing them in battle is surely the quickest method.${prompt};
I hesitate to use the word “massacre,” but if that is what you must do to them, then so be it.${prompt};
You would be doing me...<cough> Adoulin a great service.${prompt};
If you have no questions, then I recommend you get started right away. They certainly will not part with their equipment willingly!${prompt};
Yes, these will do nicely. Excellent work.${prompt};
How many did you slaughter? Tens? Hundreds?${prompt};
Forgive my transgression. I did, after all, let you choose your method of acquisition.${prompt};
What a splendid favor you have done me this day. I have avenged my wife, and hopefully she can be at peace.${prompt};
You see, she...;
No, I will not burden you with such a sordid tale.${prompt};
Should you happen to come across ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]} again, you only need bring them to me.${prompt};
Numerous Velkk clans rrreside in this area. I don't care how battleworn you are--don't let your guard down. That's when they strike.${prompt};
Purrrsonally, I'd love to sink my claws into those Velkk around here and make a nice handbag, but I need a bit of help. You in?${prompt};
Up for some Velkk skinning?;
${selection-lines};
Bloody pulp, here I come!;
Violence is never the answer.${prompt};
Oh, come on. You must have seen whole rrrivers of blood in your time. What's one more trickle? If you ever need your thirrrst satiated, I'll be right here.${prompt};
Rrright! Let's get down to business. I'm Jhen Durheka, in charge of surveying water quality here.${prompt};
Despite my grrruff demeanor, I'm more of a thinker than a fighter. Even my reflexes aren't enough to blitz past those Velkk in the way.${prompt};
That's where you come in--assuming you can mangle anything that gets in your way. Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and procure samples at both the source and the mouth of the river, as well as at the Dho Gates.${prompt};
The water, you see, flows down from the ravine here into the gates.${prompt};
The Velkk aren't the only thing to look out for. The cliffs are steep, and the last thing I want is some pioneer bloodying up the grrround below. Now, off with you!${prompt};
You got gunk in your ears? I need you to take samples upstream, downstream, and at the Dho Gates. Have at it before those Velkk decide to multiply!${prompt};
Wow, you actually--I mean, I didn't expect that you--;
Well, either way, you made it back in one piece! Now about that surrrveying...${prompt};
Hmm...this is quite intrrriguing. Unlike Yorcia and Hennetiel, the water here is pure. The pollution in those areas must be coming from Cirdas Caverns.${prompt};
You've been a biggerrr help than I thought--and you gave the Velkk a bit of a scare too! Here's a little something for your trouble.${prompt};

${name-player}!${prompt};
I cannot fathom how, but we have apparently beaten the coven to the punch.${prompt};
Only four guards?;
What an exceptionally low number. Do you think you can give all four of them what for?${prompt};
All right, then! I'll act as the bait, and you reel them in!;
For Altaaaaaanaaaaaa!${prompt};
This victory is surely proof that She deems our mission a righteous one. Thank you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Well, that was easy-weasy. We didn't even have to lift a finger.;
I think these drones might just have what it takes to be our personal shields.${prompt};
Soraa, are you okay?;
What?;
Why're you two here?${prompt};
Why!? To keep you from becoming-woming a Mithra meat pie, dummy!${prompt};
You really thought they'd kill me? I didn't know you were such a morrron, Zunmimi.${prompt};
If they were going to scratch me from the prrroverbial books, they'd have done it as soon as they got their claws on me.${prompt};
Yet they brrrought me here, which means they must need me for something.${prompt};
Um...;
I g-guess you have a pointaru.${prompt};
Why wouldn't they have killed her...?${prompt};
...By the way, what in the weald are this altar boy and his handler doing here?${prompt};
Well...I...that is to say...${prompt};
You can stutter-wutter once we get somewhere safe.${prompt};
Wait.;
I overheard some juicy tidbits while imprrrisoned here.${prompt};
Just how juicy were these tidbitarus?${prompt};
Some overly chatty Velkk rrrevealed the location of the you-know-what.${prompt};
You don't mean...${prompt};
Their treasure.${prompt};
Prrrecisely!;
Now, let's make like cat burglars and nab it.${prompt};
Indeed.${prompt};
But once the word's out that you've escaped, everyone'll be on high alertaru!${prompt};
They don't trrrust us anyway, but now we're already inside their lair! There won't be another chance this good in all our nine lives.${prompt};
...And you swear that you will no longer fraternize with the Velkk once you have your prize, may the heavens strike you down?${prompt};
For cerrrtain.${prompt};
Then I shall lend my aid as well.${prompt};
Hah! You? Don't make me laugh.${prompt};
What we're after is in Gramk-Droog's throne room at I-10. Not even reciting all the litanies in the exorcist annals could get that pioneer in, let alone a pew warmer like you.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Even if the tyrant himself is out, there will definitely be guards patrrrolling the area.${prompt};
What about using Sleepga?${prompt};
That could work...if there weren't mage-wages among their ranks.${prompt};
Then we'll just have to rrrush in, spells a-spewin'.${prompt};
Sounds like a plan to me. I'm sure I can conjure-wonjure up more terrifying abominations with my pinky toe than those savages can with their whole beings.${prompt};
That's right, we don't need weaklings like you, pulpit polisher. Go back to sprrrinkling holy water on the priory plants or whatever it is you waste your useless life doing.${prompt};
Do not address me as a “pulpit polisher”! I have a name, and it is Nashu.${prompt};
...And then there were two.;
I wonder if they can manage by themselves...${prompt};
No, I think they truly need our help after all.;
To I-10 or bust, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Madam] ${name-player}!${prompt};
I don't see any sign of Grrramk-Droog...${prompt};
Don't let the bedbugs bite.${prompt};
How're we supposed to testaru our skills if they won't even station mages around their leader's lair?${prompt};
According to my gabby guards, there should be a secret door behind the ruler's thrrrone.${prompt};
So this is what they were hiding-widing...${prompt};
It's beautiful...${prompt};
Drrrat!;
You two, huh?;
Well, it looks like our prrrayers have been answered.${prompt};
How did these dull lunk-wunks wake up so fast!?${prompt};
And now it doesn't even affectaru them!?${prompt};
Me know more than others. Thing like poison wake people. Me learn that from no-scales.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
Taking poison to stay awake!? I thought only pioneers were stupid enough to do that!${prompt};
Did you learn how to fake falling asleep from them as well? Color-wolor me impressed, Mligni-Vorgut.${prompt};
So, witches try steal that.;
Perfect. You, unseal it.${prompt};
Unseal it...?${prompt};
Magic sealed away. We no can unseal, so was useless.${prompt};
We let you live so you unseal.${prompt};
What gave you the idea that I know the firrrst thing about--${prompt};
Just do it.${prompt};
Soraa...${prompt};
...Brrring it on, Buckteeth.${prompt};
Wh-wha!?;
What goes on!?${prompt};
Rrrrrruuun!${prompt};
<Haaah>...<haaah>...;
That was close...${prompt};
Awww...;
And it was right within my grrrasp, too...${prompt};
You mean this?${prompt};
When did you...!?${prompt};
You never cease-wease to amaze me, Melisandra.${prompt};
The light seems to have gone out. What was that currriosity, anyway?${prompt};
I certainly do not hold the answer to your question, but I do know this--I am positively overjoyed that you got what you came for.${prompt};
I...I guess...we couldn't have grrrabbed it without your help.${prompt};
Well, I guess it's time to be hitting the ol' dusty trrrail! Yup, sure is! See you arrround, Nashu.${prompt};
“Nashu”...?${prompt};
She...remembered my name.${prompt};
A-anyhow...at least the coven's cut all its ties with the Velkk, right?${prompt};
Once again, I have you to thank for engineering the seemingly impossible. In case the undying gratitude of a mere trainee proves an insufficient reward, please take this.${prompt};
...I must now take my leave and report what we have discovered to Lord Vortimere. Hopefully it will give him cause to recall the troops he dispatched.${prompt};
May our paths cross once more, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Mligni-Vorgut! Why you let treasure get snitch-snatched!?${prompt};
I apologize, sir. Unexpected thing happened.${prompt};
No want apology! Want treasure!;
Get it back now!${prompt};
With respect, I think to wait is best.${prompt};
“Wait”!? Why?${prompt};
You shall see...;
Bwahahaha!${prompt};
${name-player}! You've come just in time.${prompt};
I haven't seen Soraa and the others yet, but the priory stands ready to strike.${prompt};
This feels strange. The Velkk should have fully anticipated our advance, yet where is their defense?${prompt};
Indeed.${prompt};
N-n-nevertheless, we can ill afford any delay. There's no telling what that c-c-cursed Velkk mage can do now that he has his claws around that artifact.${prompt};
The frontier station scouts have spotted Mligni-Vorgut near Gramk-Droog's throne at I-10.;
Let us s-s-split into two divisions and flank him.${prompt};
Araustoix, you and your men will take the w-w-waterfall pass.${prompt};
I want you and Nashu to come with us.${prompt};
Yes sir!${prompt};
Mligni has been spotted near the throne at I-10.;
Hurry--we can't just sit here and twiddle our thumbs!${prompt};
Velkk-kin, listen!;
Mligni-Vorgut hold power to break big wall!${prompt};
Follow Mligni! Smash no-scales! Take back Velkk land!${prompt};
Mligni...!${prompt};
What this joke!?;
Get off Gramk's king-seat. It not for your rump!${prompt};
Velkk have no use for old king now.${prompt};
King Gramk!${prompt};
Urg...${prompt};
So that's what the orb can do.${prompt};
Are we t-t-too late?${prompt};
Lord Vortimere, can you hear me? What is your command?${prompt};
Failing to stop him here will be to Adoulin's p-p-peril.;
Carry out the attack plan.${prompt};
Wait!${prompt};
Soraa?${prompt};
If there's anyone who knows how to put the lid back on his magic, it's us.${prompt};
What are you s-s-saying?${prompt};
The artifact's seal could only be broken with the purest energies of crystal clear water.${prompt};
So if we want to restore it, we'll just have to muddy things up a bit.${prompt};
“Muddy things up”? How?${prompt};
As it turns out, our ancestors left us the purrrfect incantation for the occasion.${prompt};
The spell we found won't reseal it completely, but it should be enough to weaken it.${prompt};
We're too...far away.${prompt};
That's right. We'll have to getaru a wee bit closer if we want to make this work.${prompt};
We will provide s-s-support.${prompt};
Araustoix, draw the Velkk away from the throne to give the witches a w-w-window to strike.${prompt};
Understood.${prompt};
Make ready...;
Engage!${prompt};
Now!${prompt};
No-scales must be very not clever to come here...${prompt};
You die now!;
What!?${prompt};
Power...no work?${prompt};
What you do to power!?${prompt};
Sneaky no-scales...Mligni no need power to make die!${prompt};
Guuurrr... If only had power!;
Still, you can no win.${prompt};
Kurhurhur...;
You can no hurt Mligni here.${prompt};
Witches soon grow tired. Power come back. Then no-scales die.${prompt};
Wha...?${prompt};
Can't...hold it...${prompt};
Hang in there! If the spell breaks, we're toastaru!${prompt};
Prepare to r-r-retreat!${prompt};
No, there's got to be a way...${prompt};
...Of course!${prompt};
Nashu, take the device out of my tunic and give it to ${name-player}, quickly!${prompt};
Your tunic...?${prompt};
Wait. Isn't this that contraption you made earlier?${prompt};
${name-player}, use it on Mligni!${prompt};
No! No possible!;
Gooor...;
Dirty no-scales...how break wall?${prompt};
We...we did it!${prompt};
Look out!;
Nashu!${prompt};
Ugaaar!?${prompt};
Hang in there!${prompt};
Nashu... Why were you so r-r-reckless?${prompt};
No...${prompt};
...${prompt};
You stupid, stupid idiot.;
Who told you to die?${prompt};
Soraa...${prompt};
I won't let you die!${prompt};
Wha--!?${prompt};
What...? I thought I was...${prompt};
He lives!${prompt};
Remarkable...${prompt};
Nashu...you...you stupid...${prompt};
Soraa!?${prompt};
Don't worry, she's just faintarued. I've never seen Sis use so much magic.${prompt};
The artifact...shattered.${prompt};
So...;
She used up the artifact's power to save me?${prompt};
And it's for the best, if you ask me.;
That artifactaru would have been too much to handle, even for us.${prompt};
So the present c-c-crisis has been averted. Altana be praised.${prompt};
Well done, all of you.${prompt};
Now let us r-r-return to Adoulin.${prompt};
Hmmm? Is it safe to leave him here?${prompt};
He will get his comeuppance, no doubt, at the hands of his own kin.${prompt};
The Velkk will not take his treason lightly.${prompt};
I suspect we shan't be harbored from their wrath as well.;
We would do best to leave before the storm.${prompt};
We can't leave Soraa here. In her state she'll need the infirmary's care. You two had better come as well. It's best if you're with her.${prompt};
Nashu, you seriously mean to bring those witches into the city?${prompt};
That...that's right.${prompt};
Have you forgotten the evil the Blackthorn Coven has done? Do you expect the people of Adoulin to so easily forgive their sins?${prompt};
But...you saw them save our skins just now! You'd have us, as Adoulinians, just leave them here to those savages?${prompt};
The people will not stand for--${prompt};
Nashu is right.${prompt};
Araustoix...?${prompt};
We owe them our lives. To cast such a life debt aside and leave them to their fate would be most iniquitous.${prompt};
Is it not so, Lord Vortimere?${prompt};
Indeed.;
I will endeavor to m-m-make the people of Adoulin understand.${prompt};
Thank you, Lord Vortimere!${prompt};
You must be exhausted as well, ${name-player}. Come with us to the infirmary in Western Adoulin.${prompt};
I'll make sure Soraa and her sisters get cared for in town.${prompt};
No-scales not stop us.;
Bow to Mligni's power!${prompt};

I figured you'd find your way here.${prompt};
This lush crevasse is full of winding corridors. It makes me think of the many paths down which Marjami had to tread before developing her school of swordsmanship.${prompt};
Yet the prevailing theory on how this ravine came to be named after Marjami is a bit more dramatic. People say that she infused a blade with myriad elemental powers and unleashed them in one fell stroke upon the ground, shearing rifts throughout the land.${prompt};
“Why,” you ask? Because of the battle that unfurled between them and a being of unrivaled might.${prompt};
<Haaah>... <Haaah>...;
I...don't think...I can go on.${prompt};
But the fight has just begun! We can't lie down and die so easily!${prompt};
Should we cede this ravine, our forces on the coast will be utterly annihilated.${prompt};
Cirdas... Do you think it's possible for you to fight without the benediction I cast?${prompt};
What're you saying!? Revoking your favor would be absolutely ridiculous!${prompt};
Please...just for a little bit.${prompt};
...Alright. I'll do what I can.${prompt};
Hennetiel, I know you're pretty terrible at most things, but you've figured out which end of a polearm is the pointy one, right?${prompt};
Hmph. What sort of trick do you think you have up your sleeve?${prompt};
I'm going to coat your lance with the remainder of my powers. Even you should know how to take it from there.${prompt};
What absurdity! If you do that, you shall...;
Marjami, no! Please, I beg of you...!${prompt};
Rune fencers are one with their sword, but must augment their arsenal with magical properties to enhance themselves, thus becoming true forces to be reckoned with.${prompt};
Many thought it easier to employ such tactics with sturdier blades rather than brittle epees and rapiers, so they switched their martial allegiance to those weapons.${prompt};
With this change in weaponry came an increasing need for strength.${prompt};
The emphasis shifted from parrying enemy attacks to striking out at opponents.${prompt};
The transition likely ended in the blink of an eye. It couldn't take long to see that greatswords' reach and weight would be prized attributes within this new philosophy.${prompt};
...I suppose that is as good an example of progress as you'll find in any school primer.${prompt};

The ${item-singular: 1[2]} thou hast entrusted to our keeping can endure only ${number: 0} more enchantments.;
Thenceforth, it shall be rendered useless. Pray be wary!${prompt};
Greetings, traveler!;
How dost thou fare in thine adventures?${prompt};
By my troth, what a thrilling battle! When thou landed the felling blow, a shiver ran down my wings!;
As promised, here is thy reward.${prompt};
Dost thou find this enchantment to thy liking?${prompt};
Accept the item?;
${selection-lines};
Accept.;
Refuse. (${number: 0} times remaining)${prompt};
Splendid!;
May it serve thee well.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}${entity: 0} obtained ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Ah, 'tis unfortunate.;
Sadly, my folk are not well-versed in the penchants of adventurers these days...${prompt};
In that event, we shall prepare thy weapon to be enchanted anew.;
May thou be once more triumphant in battle anon!${prompt};
What's this?;
'Twould appear that thy weapon can endure no further enchantments.${prompt};
Though it may fall short of thy expectations, pray accept it.${prompt};
Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to dispose of it.${prompt};
Many thanks for thine assistance!${prompt};
Pray accept this ${item-singular: 0[2]} as but a humble token of our gratitude.${prompt};

Ferocious Velkks approach!;
Ah, that was a most splendid battle.${prompt};
You must be here in regards to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Hehehe... I never expected to meet you again in a place like this, ${name-player}.${prompt};
If my hunch is correct, you have already figured it out.${prompt};
Indeed, I am the one who wrote that book.${prompt};
It is always exciting when I encounter new pieces on the board.${prompt};
Now then, allow me to introduce myself.;
My name is Gunther Schultz.${prompt};
I am what you would call a military scholar.;
I study, observe, and occasionally even participate in the unending battles that plague our world.${prompt};
It is in that capacity that I wrote the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} that lies before you.${prompt};
At its core, the book is essentially a dictionary on demons.${prompt};
You see, I have a long and storied history with demons, and I have heard many tales from their past.${prompt};
One day, I simply decided to organize those myriad stories and thoughts into one comprehensive tome.;
Their history spans the course of 5,000 years, after all.${prompt};
Though a project born from mere intellectual curiosity and likely rife with my own personal opinions, I do feel it is a rather practical book.${prompt};
Although, the demons themselves did seem somewhat bitter about its existence.${prompt};
I suppose that is because there are many things in there that they would prefer not be widely known.${prompt};
As such, they cast various spells on the book that bring misfortune upon any who read its pages.${prompt};
However, there is no stopping mankind's natural curiosity.${prompt};
And so, it has become an endless cycle of us defusing their magic, and them casting new spells...${prompt};
Eventually, something changed and what seemed to be a form of consciousness sprouted within the book's pages, causing me to lose my way.${prompt};
Hehehe... I sensed something about the book's power and raced here, only to find you as well.${prompt};
Hehehe... It seems the book's magic has somehow brought us here together.${prompt};
I have heard about you from one of my demon acquaintances.;
You are ${name-player}, right?${prompt};
Are you ${name-player}?;
${selection-lines};
That's me.;
Who's that?${prompt};
I can see you are the cautious sort.;
You must be quite determined if you wish to try and deceive me.${prompt};
I hear you have found yourself caught up in the efforts to resolve the chaos surrounding the demons' home of Valhalla?${prompt};
I find your skills and general ability to be quite fascinating.${prompt};
In fact, with your luck, I believe it might be possible to bring an end to this chaos with a minimal number of moves.${prompt};
As we have been forced to suspend our efforts in Valhalla, we are looking forward to what actions you can take as an outsider.${prompt};
As such, I shall let you take the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.;
Whether you read it yourself or not is up to you.${prompt};
I plan to watch things from afar.;
It is said that the best course of action is to unite the country--and if that fails, to at least ensure its destruction.${prompt};
Now then, I shall take my leave.;
I look forward to our next encounter.${prompt};
If you ever require another lesson in the art of war, feel free to call upon me as your teacher.${prompt};
You must deliver the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} to the Celennia Memorial Library in Eastern Adoulin.${prompt};
