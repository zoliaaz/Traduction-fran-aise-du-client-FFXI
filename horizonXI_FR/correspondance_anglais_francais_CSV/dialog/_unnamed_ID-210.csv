Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.${prompt};
To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.${prompt};
You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.${prompt};
We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.${prompt};
Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.${prompt};
The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.${prompt};
Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!${prompt};
Value is determined by the calculation of “points” and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the “smallest fish,” the person with the fewest points will win.${prompt};
During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!${prompt};
If you would like to submit an entry, please ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.${prompt};
The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest.;
You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.${prompt};
After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.${prompt};
To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.${prompt};
This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.${prompt};
After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.${prompt};
Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!${prompt};
The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.${prompt};
In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as a souvenir.${prompt};
You may only receive your award while the results are being announced, so be sure that you are here on time!${prompt};

Hello, faithful fans!;
Mighty Maiden Uka here!;
Just by looking at your smiling faces, I can tell you're all having a great time at this year's Sunbreeze Festival!;
So, are you rrready for some music? I know we're ready to sing our hearrrts out!;
...Um, or at least I am.;
Where in sweet Selbina could Mumor be!?;
Oh well, the show must go on.;
It's a little embarrassing to sing by myself, but any entertainer worth her miraclesalt would jump at this opporrrtunity.;
This is my chance to go solo!;
Everyone, feast your earrrs upon my astounding aria.;
Your cacophonous warbling is enough to make me vacate the contents of my stomach.;
These people are not stupid, either... They know that without your partner, you aren't even worth the stage on which you stand.;
Who goes there!?;
Who, indeed... Understandable, since I believe this is the first time I've deigned to grace you with my presence.;
I am a diva. Does that appellation ring any bells for you, pray tell?;
A diva!? They truly exist!?;
Oh, so you have indeed heard of my kind? No wonder you were once my master's favorite archfiend.;
Though, in all truth, the title “archfiend” refers to nothing more than washed-up hacks who possess neither the drive nor the talent to reach for the stars...of divadom!;
Yet now you've thrown even that away, settling for a mundane life of belching out dull drivel at vulgar venues.;
Someone as wretched as you holds no value whatsoever.;
...;
Or do you...?;
I heard you associate with some upstart floozy who dares defy my master and dissuades archfiends from our cause. Do you know where she is?;
Well, it seems you're all alone.;
No matter. She'll simply have to wait until I'm finished with you.;
Cooome now, my preeecious!♪;
Of course, someone of my sublime stature would never condescend to personally dispatch with a peon like you.;
This minion should prove more than a sufficient substitute for accomplishing that task.;
The crowd here may be raucous, but drown out its pesky din.♪;
Now give yourself up to your dreams, just cast away your strife.★;
Next, let your heavy eyelids fall and drool drip down your chin.♪;
This soothing, tranquil lullaby leaves all bereft of life.★;
Even without Mumor...I can cut this cocky diva down to size!;
Everyone, lend me your strength!;
Yeep!;
Hmph, it seems you may possess at least an iota of skill after all.;
I'm not alone. I have the whole audience on my side!;
Let's do this, everyone!;
Neo Crrrystal Jig!!!;
Super Crrrusher Jig!!!;
Shining Summerrr Samba!!!;
Lovely Mirrracle Waltz!!!;
Grrr...!;
Don't just stand there and take it, you invariably incompetent imbecile!;
Neo Crystal Jig!;
Super Crusher Jig!;
Shining Summer Samba!;
Lovely Miracle Waltz!;
Urk...!;
Well now...;
We must all work as one! Please, lend me your strrrength!;
I-it can't be...;
Ahahaha! Those earth tones truly do bring your outfit together, Uka.;
You archfiends exist as nothing more than mere stepping stones on my path to glory!;
It matters not how many enemies assail me. I can dispatch them all with but the bat of an eye!;
You may now exit stage right. Oh, and I don't think you'll need to worry about any encores.;
Fear not, I'll be sure to invite your friend to the after-party as well!;
Ahhhhhh!!!;
Bwahahaha!!!;
And so, without Mumor, Uka quickly succumbed to the diva and was banished to an interdimensional purgatory...;
Be more supportive of her and you can overturn what has just transpired.;
Band together and cheer on Uka to save her from the diabolical diva!;
Haaah, haaah... I've got to hand it to you. I don't think I can beat you by myself.;
If only Mumor were herrre, too.;
Mumor? Oh, you mean that sorry excuse for a nemesis.;
Just how might the addition of one more classless poseur change what is so obviously inevitable?;
You certainly are persistent. My master must have seen...;
But enough chatter! This time I shall truly send you off into eternal slumber with a special lullaby.;
In the name of joy and happiness, I shall punish you!;
Mumor!;
Please forgive me, Uka. I tried oh-so-hard not to be late!;
You see, I was in a meeting with the produc--;
I mean, I took too long deciding what to wear. Teehee!;
A what with whom?;
Hmmm? You must be hearing things.;
Who is this moogle, anyway?;
Huh? Oh, yeah.;
She's a diva--one of Ullegore's songstrrresses--which means she has a much more talented voice than any of us forrrmer archfiends.;
Another one?;
I'm sick and tired of Ullegore's lackeys trying to ruin our performances!;
Ruin? Your act doesn't leave much to ruin.;
Besides, this stage was built for a diva of my caliber, not amateurs such as yourselves.;
H-how dare you! My sultry singing is the perfect complement to Uka's dynamic dancing, and that's why our popularity soars higher than any airship!;
Think what you will. We shall see if you're still singing the same tune after I show you how to hold a true note.;
This is simply impossible!;
How can the addition of one saucy starlet change the tide of battle so?;
I guess you haven't heard.;
Mumor can absorrrb the energy from her cheerrring fans to unleash a devastating attack...;
And when you add in Uka's Dancing Force...;
Our power levels climb to over nine thousand!!!;
P-power levels!? What sort of nonsense are you--;
Let's play off this hoary old has-been before she even has a chance to butcher her swan song!;
To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...;
We'll dance to the abyss and back!;
Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!;
Eternal Vana Illusion!!!;
Ahhh!;
!?;
Th-the demon king...;
Ullegore!?;
How nice to see you in such dire straits, Uka.;
And I would hardly be a demon king if I didn't extend the same greeting to my archnemesis. Now would I, Mumor?;
However, it won't do for me to lose one of my precious divas. We beg your leave...but shall depart regardless of your answer.;
Not so fast!;
Don't you fret, my darling prima donna. We shall meet again, much to your chagrin.;
Wherever there is a festival, I shall lurk amidst the shadows.;
I shall bide my time until the glorious day when I can extinguish every last festive flame, enshrouding Vana'diel in a tenebrous mantle of tedium and ennui!;
Bwa, bwa, Bwahaha--hhhk...ack...ptewy...;
What a stunning performance, Mighty Maidens!;
Next time, you mightaru want to <mumble-mumble>...;
And ye best git some rest while ye still can!;
You don't need to tell us that twice!;
You three have rrreally grown into your roles as gof...er, managerrrs. Keep up the good work!;
We are wholly undeserving of such lofty praise.;
(We shall be the ones meting out empty compliments when Cream Puff's shining star eclipses you misnomered Mighty Maidens!);
Was that meant to be a backstage comment? Because even people all the way up in the gallery could hear it!;
!?;
Y-yikes! No curtain call for us this time!!!;
We're so grateful to you, our devoted and trustworthy fans, for coming out and supporting us!;
That diva may have backed us into a corner, but with you all behind us, there was no way we could lose!;
That dastardly Ullegore best watch his back, too! The Mighty Maidens will put a stop to his tyranny of tedium once and for all!;
Now delve into the myriad delights that the Sunbreeze Festival has to offer!;

We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo?;
Will you not be content until every last moogle is in the poorhouse!? <Sniff>...<sob>... ${prompt};

How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery!;

No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;

That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};

Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.;
Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt};
By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt};
At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt};
That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt};
From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt};
But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt};
The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.;
As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt};
We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt};
Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.;
For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt};
Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt};

Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel.;

I see you've yet to be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.${prompt};
You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or “jurisdiction.”${prompt};
Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.${prompt};
While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};

When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.;
The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.${prompt};
Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!${prompt};
Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.${prompt};
You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.;
This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.${prompt};

“Voidwalker” is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.${prompt};
Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt};
While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt};
As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt};
To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt};
Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt};
Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt};
Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.;
Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt};
These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.;
They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt};
Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt};
The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt};
That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt};
Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt};
Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt};
Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt};
You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt};
Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt};
The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt};
When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt};
However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt};
Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt};
Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt};
But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt};
You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.;
In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt};
The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt};
To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt};
One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt};
All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt};
Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt};
For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt};
In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt};
Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt};
If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt};
Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.;
It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt};
Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt};
Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt};
Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.;
They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt};
(Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt};
They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt};
Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt};
Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.;
But I digress...${prompt};
Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt};
As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.;
Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt};
It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.;
Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt};
Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt};
Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt};
The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt};
I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt};
I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt};
Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt};
Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt};
Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.;
Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt};
And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt};
I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.;
Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt};
As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.;
Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt};
Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt};
Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.;
There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.;
Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt};
Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?;
Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt};
As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.;
Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt};
The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.;
Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?;
Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt};
At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.;
Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt};
If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt};
Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.;
The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt};
Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt};
"Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}";
Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt};
It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt};
If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt};
Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt};
As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.;
There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt};
Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt};
Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.;
If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt};
As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt};
Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt};
Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt};

A summons just came in from the Grand Duchy, and it's got your name on it.;
The envoy said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you get moving.${prompt};
We've been looking for you, soldier.;
I've got a summons from the Grand Duchy here, and just look at the name on it: ${name-player}.;
Our messenger said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you ready yourself and depart immediately.${prompt};

Happy 9th Vana'versary, kupo!;
I've received a proper profusion of congratulatory letters from all over the land!${prompt};
Now, knowing how you adventurers are busier than breadwinner bees, I've chosen only the choicest missive to recite.;
Here goes! Ahem!${prompt};
“Esteemed adventurers of Vana'diel,;
In the wake of your passage blows the wind of peace and prosperity.;
In the sparkling of your eyes we behold a future bright and fair.${prompt};
“On behalf of all Jeuno, I extend to you my heartfelt gratitude.;
The Duchy is ever indebted to you, her gates ever open to you.;
Now and for all time.;
${prompt};
Archduke Kam'lanaut”${prompt};
How's about that, eh? Such a high heaping of praise from Jeuno's head honcho himself is a right rarity, kupo!;
Why, I was nigh swept off my wings when I first read the letter!${prompt};
Oho! Your evidently expectant expression tells me you know what's coming next!${prompt};
Tada! Deck yourself in these dandy duds and set free your festive frame of mind, kupopo!${prompt};
Kupo-whoa! Looking decidedly ${choice-player-gender}[debonair/dazzling] there, kupo!${prompt};
That reminds me, we're running low on materials needed to make the garments.;
Deliveries of custom-made fabric, leather, and metal trimmings haven't arrived in quite some time, kupo.${prompt};
What could possibly be causing the delay?;
I'd go and see for myself, but for my permanent posting here, kupo...${prompt};
Hm? Why aren't you sporting your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
You can't just amble about in awkwardly arranged attire, kupo!${prompt};
Hey, why aren't you clothed congruously with the celebration, kupo?${prompt};
What? Don't have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you say?${prompt};
I can't allow you to amble about in awkwardly arranged attire, kupo!;
Here, quickly slip this on before you become the laughingstock of mooglekind!${prompt};
What? You have neither ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} nor ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, kupo!?;
We barely have enough to hand out, yet you go misplacing yours! Utterly unbelievable!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Listen, kupo. I like you, so I'm going to issue you a replacement set.;
Just don't go blabbing to your buddies about the boon, all right?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
We're still short on ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}, kupo.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
We're still short on ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo!? You've obtained the overdue objects for me, you say!?${prompt};
Oh, deliriously delightful day!;
Without ado, pray present the procured pieces to me!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} hands the materials to the excited moogle.;
Wonderful! I can fairly find no fault with the items, kupo!${prompt};
You have done us moogles a great service!;
Truly, you are deserving of the noble (and non-existent) Adventurer of the Anniversary Award, kupo!${prompt};
Please accept this as a tiny token of my gargantuan gratitude.${prompt};
The Adventurer Appreciation Campaign will run for a limited time only.;
Be sure to make the most of it while it lasts, kupo!${prompt};
Uwaaah! I...I'm going to be dealt a d-d-dreadful death, kupo!${prompt};
Look, I'm keeping the creature provoked, so there's nothing to be afraid of. You can stop hiding in mommy's skirt now.${prompt};
Uwaaah! A monstrous moogle-eating mommy lizard! Don't let it n-n-near me, kupo!${prompt};
A monstrous moogle-eating...what? Are you even listening to me?;
Nothing's going to hurt you, so get a grip already!${prompt};
Uwaaah! Um...I mean, is that n-n-novennial attire you're sporting?;
It looks suitably swanky on you, k-k-kupo!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} apprises the moogle of the material shortage.;
Uwaaah! I-I mean, oh dear, that's quite a p-p-pickle.;
But I'm not to blame. I would've made a d-d-dozen deliveries by now, weren't it for the repulsive reptiles raging for my moogle flesh, k-k-kupo.${prompt};
A moogle stricken with an unnatural fear of the very thing he hunts...;
Can it get any more absurd?${prompt};
H-hey, I'll have you know our duties were designated by a draw! I had no choice whatsoever in my posting, kupo!${prompt};
Adventurer, I must beg a b-b-boon of you.;
I need this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} delivered without delay to San d'Oria.${prompt};
Deliver the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
I shall.;
Um...${prompt};
My th-thanks, kupo! A more altruistic adventurer I've never known!;
Now, a moogle crafter awaits by the Tanners' Guild. Please see the skin s-s-safely to his hands.${prompt};
The adventurer's obviously busy.;
Instead of bothering ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], why don't I just take it?${prompt};
Uwaaah! You can't leave me to fend for myself, kupo! I won't last a minute on my own!${prompt};
<Sigh>... Even unreasonable fear has limits, you know.;
Look, friend. We could really do with the help. As a fellow adventurer, won't you reconsider?${prompt};
Put your back into it, kupo! I won't stand for slackers at my station!${prompt};
(Curse my ill luck working for this hovering ball of brutality...)${prompt};
Do you have something to say, kupo!?${prompt};
Eeep! J-just mumbling to myself, mister moogle, sir!${prompt};
Ah! It soothes my soul to see someone swathed in the celebratory spirit, kupo!${prompt};
Are you serious, kupo!?;
I'll wager my two wings that worthless weasel of a worker fled without delivering the ore!${prompt};
(Small wonder, you bulbous brute.)${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The moogle shoots a murderous glare at his hireling.;
Hmph, you can thank your lucky stars I have more pressing problems at hand.${prompt};
I'm sorry, adventurer, but I have a favor to ask of you.;
I need this ore taken to the moogle crafter posted by the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok, the quicker the bet--${prompt};
...What do you think you're staring at, eh?;
Get back to work, you rotten rice ball thief!${prompt};
Eeep! Y-yes, sir, mister moogle!;
(Goddess get me outta here!)${prompt};
Bugs everywhere, kupo!;
Big ones, bitty ones! Inside my mouth--<ptooey!>--in the folds of my wings!${prompt};
I'm afraid there's no helpy-welp for it. This place is a ripe breeding ground for insectarus.${prompt};
Every ilm of my body itches, kupo! Arrrgh, make it stop!${prompt};
Ah! If it isn't an adventurer--<scratch, scratch>--all accoutered for the anniversary!;
You look smashingly splendid, kupo!${prompt};
Ahem! Thank you, kupo, for reminding us of our tardiness.;
Truth be told, I've been itching so irritably, gathering hasn't been on the forefront of my mind. On this outing I've obtained just one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...but perhaps it will suffice until we can scare up some more.${prompt};
I don't think we have any other options. We're terribly-werribly sorry to impose, friend, but could you go to the Weavers' Guild in our stead? My moogle companion and I will step up the harvesting effortaru in the meantime.${prompt};
We owe you one, kupo! Thank you ever so much!${prompt};
Now then, we need the item taken to the Weavers' Guild in Windurst Woods.;
The moogle crafter there will be positively pleased to possess it, kupo.${prompt};
Ummm...I don't want to alarm you, but it seems you've scratched your bottom-wottom free of fur.${prompt};
Kupopo!? Egads, you're right!;
But the itching--<scratch, scratch>--just won't--<scratch, scratch>--stop, kupo! Arrrgh!${prompt};
That's too bad, kupo. But promise to come back if you're not otherwise occupied, all right? <Scratch, scratch>${prompt};
I like smooth hide and I cannot lie～♪${prompt};
You other moogles can't deny～♪${prompt};
Oooh! Oooh! You've brought the article of my ample affection, kupo!${prompt};
And your timing couldn't have been better! I'd just finished tanning the last skin, you see, and need it delivered to the distribution moogle.${prompt};
Should you happen to also have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}, you'll want to hand those over as well. Now, run along, kupo!${prompt};
That when a lizard stalks in with scaly skin～♪${prompt};
<Mumble, mutter>...${prompt};
The shipment should've arrived hours ago. I sense something acutely amiss, kupo.${prompt};
Surely they're not big enough dunces to do the digging at the Palborough Mines...${prompt};
Why, this is ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! The Goddess be praised, kupo!${prompt};
You've no idea how I've tossed and turned for this! You have my appreciation in ample amounts, kupo!;
Now, if you'll wait there just a moment...${prompt};
Voila! It's ready, kupo!${prompt};
I want you to pass the clasp to the distribution moogle along with ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}!${prompt};
Hurry along now! Much obliged in advance, kupo!${prompt};
Why do they not return!? A pilgrimage of procurement to Giddeus should not take this long, kupo!${prompt};
I swear upon my noble name, they shall pay for the contemptible crime of making the Ultimate Moogler wait!${prompt};
Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Ku-kupo!?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}An overwhelming aura of tension emanates from the moogle.;
Ah! I can feel it! The object for which I, the Ultimate Moogler, have long waited!${prompt};
Gimme gimme gimme, kupo!${prompt};
Bwahahaha! Even such complex crafting is as child's play to the Ultimate Moogler!${prompt};
You! I hereby appoint you Bearer of the Cloth, kupo!${prompt};
How will you respond?;
${selection-lines};
You honor me, Great One!;
I shan't fail you, Great One!;
Your wish is my command, Great One!${prompt};
Your answer pleases the Ultimate Moogler.;
Hear you, then, these divine directives.${prompt};
Take this cloth and see it safely to the moogle who gifted you those gorgeous garments, kupo. Permit no harm to befall it--not a single stain nor snag is to be sustained. Protect it with your life on paradoxical pain of perishing.${prompt};
Be further forewarned! The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} must be delivered simultaneously--such is the Ultimate Moogler's decree.${prompt};
Now, begone from my sight, lest you be consumed by the aura of the Ultimate Moogler! Kupoarrrgh!${prompt};

Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.${prompt};
To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.${prompt};
I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.${prompt};
Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.${prompt};
Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.${prompt};
Will you stay mum?;
${selection-lines};
Mum's the word.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.${prompt};
Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.${prompt};
Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.${prompt};
Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this “crystal storage,” if you will.${prompt};
It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.${prompt};
But I can store more than crystals alone. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and the like are also acceptable.${prompt};
My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.${prompt};
You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!${prompt};
You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.${prompt};
Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The ${name-npc} gives a sly smile.;
This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.${prompt};
If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.${prompt};
Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.${prompt};
It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.${prompt};
I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.${prompt};
You are now able to store crystals!;
Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?${prompt};
