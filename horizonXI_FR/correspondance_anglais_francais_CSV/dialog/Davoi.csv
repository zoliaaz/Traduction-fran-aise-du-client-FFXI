Leave the tower?;Non.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Quitter la tour ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
Have you been to the cave to the south? Best to stay away if you know the danger! Not that it's all that easy to find the way in there...${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Huh? You really wantaru into that cave? Hah! Not after I went through all that trouble sealing off the Orc lord...${prompt};Êtes-vous allé à la grotte au sud ? Mieux vaut rester à l'écart si vous connaissez le danger ! Ce n'est pas facile de trouver l'entrée...${prompt}
Especially not now, with reinforcements on the way! Bestaru to stay outta that cave, I say!${prompt};Hein ? Vous voulez vraiment entrer dans cette grotte ? Hah ! Pas après que j'ai scellé le seigneur Orc...${prompt}
But...you made it this far. Guess I'll give you a chance!${prompt};Surtout pas maintenant, avec les renforts en route ! Mieux vaut rester hors de cette grotte, je dis !${prompt}
Take your chances?;Mais... vous êtes arrivé jusqu'ici. Je suppose que je vais vous donner une chance !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Prendrez-vous le risque ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
Alrighty, then. Pass my test, and I'll let you into that meanie-weanie old cave.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
I'm going to give you ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, which you are to dip in the four red pools of Davoi. You'll know the orb is absorbing magic when its color changes!${prompt};D'accord. Passez mon test et je vous laisserai entrer dans cette méchante vieille grotte.${prompt}
Once you're done, bring it back here and I'll grade you!${prompt};Je vais vous donner ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, que vous devez tremper dans les quatre bassins rouges de Davoi. Vous saurez que l’orbe absorbe la magie lorsque sa couleur changera !${prompt}
Heeeey, don't worry! Long as nothing...unexpected happens, you'll do just fine! I guarantee it! Bonne chance!${prompt};Une fois que vous avez terminé, ramenez-le ici et je vous noterai !${prompt}
Oh yeah, I almostaru forgot. Monsters flock to those red pools like flies to Quadav droppings. You watch yourself out there!${prompt};Hééé, ne vous inquiétez pas ! Tant que rien... d'inattendu ne se produit, vous vous en sortirez très bien ! Je vous le garantis ! Bonne chance !${prompt}
You receive a white orb.${prompt};Oh oui, j'ai presque oublié. Les monstres affluent vers ces bassins rouges comme des mouches sur des excréments de Quadav. Faites attention !${prompt}
Humph. Sissy!${prompt};Vous recevez une orbe blanche.${prompt}
Heeeey, so you made it back in one piece? Good, good! Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing: if an orb turns totally red, it gets cursed.${prompt};Pff. Poltron !${prompt}
W-w-wait a second! Isn't that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you have there!?${prompt};Hééé, vous êtes revenu en un seul morceau ? Bon, bon ! Oh, j’ai oublié de vous dire une chose : si une orbe devient totalement rouge, elle est maudite.${prompt}
Well, I guess all's well that ends well! This is aboutaru all the power you'll need, methinks.${prompt};A-attendez une seconde ! N’est-ce pas ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} que vous avez là !?${prompt}
Let me just give it the barrier-disruption spells it so very much deserves...${prompt};Eh bien, je suppose que tout est bien qui finit bien ! C'est à peu près toute la puissance dont vous aurez besoin, je pense.${prompt}
And there you go! Take that ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} and stick it into the barrier. That should disruptaru the thing long enough for you to go in.${prompt};Laissez-moi juste lui donner les sorts de perturbation de barrière qu'elle mérite tant...${prompt}
Take care and don't let the Orcs get it! There now, off you go! Good luck!${prompt};Et voilà ! Prenez cette ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} et mettez-la dans la barrière. Cela devrait perturber la chose assez longtemps pour que vous puissiez entrer.${prompt}
Ahhh... You know, I'm sure I'm forgetting something...${prompt};Faites attention et ne laissez pas les Orcs l'obtenir ! Voilà, maintenant, allez-y ! Bonne chance !${prompt}
What was that now? Hmm...${prompt};Ahhh... Vous savez, je suis sûr que j'oublie quelque chose...${prompt}
I am Zantaviat, a scout for San d'Oria. I was sent to watch the Orc camps in Davoi. Be careful, it's a veritable nest of beastmen in there.${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'était maintenant ? Hmm...${prompt}
A message? Finally! I am Zantaviat of the Temple Knights. I've been monitoring Orc activity here for several weeks. They grow stronger in numbers by the day.${prompt};Je suis Zantaviat, un éclaireur de San d'Oria. J'ai été envoyé pour surveiller les camps Orcs à Davoi. Faites attention, c'est un véritable nid de bêtes là-dedans.${prompt}
The longer we wait, the greater their numbers grow. We must plan to counter this buildup immediately!${prompt};Un message ? Enfin ! Je suis Zantaviat des Chevaliers du Temple. J'observe l'activité des Orcs ici depuis plusieurs semaines. Leur nombre augmente de jour en jour.${prompt}
The Temple Knights have been observing Davoi through a number of methods. We've collected our findings in a document: ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Plus nous attendons, plus leur nombre augmente. Nous devons planifier une contre-attaque immédiatement !${prompt}
However...one of our men infiltrated the area last night, and ran into an Orc hunting party on his way out. He dropped the last page of his report before he could escape.${prompt};Les Chevaliers du Temple ont observé Davoi par plusieurs méthodes. Nous avons recueilli nos conclusions dans un document : ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
The Orcs caught wind of our presence, so we could not retrieve the lost page so easily.${prompt};Cependant... l'un de nos hommes a infiltré la zone la nuit dernière et a rencontré un groupe de chasseurs Orcs en sortant. Il a laissé tomber la dernière page de son rapport avant de pouvoir s'échapper.${prompt}
According to our man, the page lies somewhere near the platform on the small pond up ahead. Go retrieve it for us.${prompt};Les Orcs ont découvert notre présence, nous ne pouvions donc pas récupérer la page perdue aussi facilement.${prompt}
With the Orcs on alert, any direct attack would only incite their full wrath. Take care not to be discovered!${prompt};Selon notre homme, la page se trouve quelque part près de la plateforme sur le petit étang plus loin. Allez la récupérer pour nous.${prompt}
You retrieve the dropped document.${prompt};Avec les Orcs en alerte, toute attaque directe ne ferait qu'inciter leur colère complète. Faites attention à ne pas être découvert !${prompt}
There is a single piece of paper here.${prompt};Vous récupérez le document perdu.${prompt}
There is nothing here.${prompt};Il y a une seule feuille de papier ici.${prompt}
You found the page! Well done. Now the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is complete. Take this to San d'Oria swiftly. Give it to the lord knight at the gatehouse.${prompt};Il n'y a rien ici.${prompt}
There's no time to lose! You must get that report to safety! Give it to the lord knight at the gatehouse.${prompt};Vous avez trouvé la page ! Bien joué. Maintenant le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est complet. Apportez-le rapidement à San d'Oria. Remettez-le au chevalier seigneur à la porte.${prompt}
You've no business with me, have you?${prompt};Il n'y a pas de temps à perdre ! Vous devez mettre ce rapport en sécurité ! Remettez-le au chevalier seigneur à la porte.${prompt}
"Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. I was waiting for you. Let us dispense with the formalities; we want you to infiltrate Davoi.${prompt}";Vous n'avez pas d'affaires avec moi, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Davoi is the central stronghold of the Orcs. We have delved as deep as we dare, but there is still much we do not know.${prompt};"Ah, c'est vous, ${name-player}. Je vous attendais. Passons aux formalités ; nous voulons que vous infiltriez Davoi.${prompt}"
Come to think of it, an adventurer came along the other day. He told me to be strong out here by myself, and then he was off towards Davoi all alone. Got courage, that one.${prompt};Davoi est la forteresse centrale des Orcs. Nous avons exploré aussi profondément que possible, mais il y a encore beaucoup que nous ne savons pas.${prompt}
But that is neither here nor there, eh?${prompt};En y réfléchissant bien, un aventurier est venu l'autre jour. Il m'a dit de rester fort ici tout seul, puis il est parti vers Davoi tout seul. Il a du courage, celui-là.${prompt}
Let me explain your mission. There are three Orc settlements in Davoi: East Block, South Block, and North Block.${prompt};Mais ce n'est ni ici ni là, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
We know that they've left coded memos concerning all three blocks. They should be somewhere in East Block.${prompt};Laissez-moi vous expliquer votre mission. Il y a trois colonies Orcs à Davoi : Bloc Est, Bloc Sud, et Bloc Nord.${prompt}
East Block is not far from this entrance. I want you to find three of those coded memos.${prompt};Nous savons qu'ils ont laissé des mémos codés concernant les trois blocs. Ils devraient se trouver quelque part dans le Bloc Est.${prompt}
Be aware that this mission will surely require combat. You way wish to gather a party to aid you.${prompt};Le Bloc Est n'est pas loin de cette entrée. Je veux que vous trouviez trois de ces mémos codés.${prompt}
You obtained a memo with East Block codes.${prompt};Soyez conscient que cette mission nécessitera sûrement des combats. Vous voudrez peut-être rassembler un groupe pour vous aider.${prompt}
You obtain a memo with South Block codes.${prompt};Vous avez obtenu un mémo avec les codes du Bloc Est.${prompt}
You obtained a memo with North Block codes.${prompt};Vous avez obtenu un mémo avec les codes du Bloc Sud.${prompt}
That's all three blocks covered. I will notify the homeland of your contribution. All you need to do is return to San d'Oria and report in at the gatehouse.${prompt};Vous avez obtenu un mémo avec les codes du Bloc Nord.${prompt}
I will notify the homeland of your success personally. You should return now to San d'Oria and report in at the gatehouse.${prompt};Tous les trois blocs sont couverts. Je vais informer la patrie de votre contribution. Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de retourner à San d'Oria et de faire votre rapport à la porte.${prompt}
You have no further business with me, do you?${prompt};Je vais informer personnellement la patrie de votre succès. Vous devriez retourner maintenant à San d'Oria et faire votre rapport à la porte.${prompt}
An old well.${prompt};Vous n'avez plus d'affaires avec moi, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

It is very damp here. There is no sunlight.${prompt};C'est vraiment génial ! Je traversais cette planche au-dessus de la barricade et j'ai glissé... et maintenant je suis tout désorienté ! Faites attention, c'est tellement humide et glissant par ici.${prompt}

I've been monitoring Orc activity here for several weeks. They grow stronger in numbers by the day.${prompt};Un message ? Enfin ! Je suis Zantaviat des Chevaliers du Temple.${prompt}
In our recent investigations, we have observed that Orcs are working towards a single purpose. Prince Pieuje was right all along...${prompt};J'ai surveillé les activités des Orcs ici pendant plusieurs semaines. Leur nombre ne cesse de croître de jour en jour.${prompt}
I had prepared ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and given it to one of our officers to deliver...${prompt};Dans nos récentes investigations, nous avons observé que les Orcs travaillent vers un objectif commun. Le Prince Pieuje avait raison depuis le début...${prompt}
...but that officer dropped one of the pages while fleeing from an Orc ambush last night.${prompt};J’avais préparé ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} et l’avais donné à l’un de nos officiers pour livraison...${prompt}
Now the Orcs have doubled their forces in that area, and we can not easily retrieve the lost page.${prompt};...mais cet officier a laissé tomber l’une des pages en fuyant une embuscade des Orcs la nuit dernière.${prompt}
According to the officer, he says he dropped the page near a crucifixion mound by that pond you see before us.${prompt};Maintenant, les Orcs ont doublé leurs forces dans cette zone, et nous ne pouvons pas facilement récupérer la page perdue.${prompt}
With the Orcs forces doubled like this, attacking them head-on would be futile. Sneaking in and retrieving the page unnoticed is the most logical method of carrying out this mission.${prompt};Selon l'officier, il dit avoir laissé tomber la page près d'un monticule de crucifixion près de l'étang que vous voyez devant nous.${prompt}
You found the page! Well done. Now the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is complete. Take this to San d'Oria swiftly and deliver it to Prince Pieuje.${prompt};Avec les forces des Orcs doublées comme ceci, les attaquer de front serait futile.

There's no time to lose! You must get that report to safety! Deliver it to Prince Pieuje.${prompt};Vous avez trouvé la page ! Bien joué. Maintenant ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est complet. Apportez-le rapidement à San d'Oria et remettez-le au Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
I see... It was just a waste of time.${prompt};Il n'y a pas de temps à perdre ! Vous devez mettre ce rapport en sécurité ! Remettez-le au Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
I assumed that because the Orcs, too, were searching for something that...${prompt};Je vois... Ce n'était qu'une perte de temps.${prompt}
Well, no matter. The fact is, there is someone else who is looking for the sword. And, either they have got to it first or...${prompt};J'ai supposé que parce que les Orcs cherchaient aussi quelque chose que...${prompt}
...I must inquire with my sister.${prompt};Eh bien, peu importe. Le fait est qu'il y a quelqu'un d'autre qui cherche l'épée. Et, soit ils l'ont trouvée en premier, soit...${prompt}

...nuisance...${prompt};À sa majorité, elle a appris tout ce qu'il y avait à savoir sur cette épée de notre père.${prompt}
Will you lend me a hand, Vauderame? I know my sister has left something for me, and I intend to find it.${prompt};...ennui...${prompt}
What?;Voulez-vous me donner un coup de main, Vauderame ? Je sais que ma sœur m'a laissé quelque chose, et j'ai l'intention de le trouver.${prompt}
I apologize, but I am in quite a hurry.${prompt};Quoi ?
What is this?;Je m'excuse, mais je suis assez pressé.${prompt}
You were ordered by Prince Trion to return with the report?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Wonderful!;Vous avez reçu l'ordre du Prince Trion de revenir avec le rapport ?${prompt}
To tell you the truth, I have been lost for the past few days. I cannot make heads or tails of where I'm going in this dreadful place.${prompt};Merveilleux !
Without this vital report, the Royal Knights will be in the dark! Your assistance is greatly appreciated!${prompt};Pour vous dire la vérité, je suis perdu depuis quelques jours. Je ne sais plus où je vais dans cet endroit horrible.${prompt}
Here is the report.;Sans ce rapport vital, les Chevaliers Royaux seront dans le noir ! Votre aide est grandement appréciée !${prompt}
Now hurry back to Prince Trion!${prompt};Voici le rapport.
Deep in Davoi, the Royal Knight, Bernal, and his Tarutaru companion are waiting for assistance. You must make haste, and deliver that report to Prince Trion!${prompt};Maintenant, retournez vite voir le Prince Trion !${prompt}
Ahahahahaha!;Au fond de Davoi, le Chevalier Royal Bernal et son compagnon Tarutaru attendent de l'aide. Vous devez faire vite et remettre ce rapport au Prince Trion !${prompt}
There it is! It's on that Tarutaru!${prompt};Ahahahahaha !
Yipes!;Le voilà ! C'est sur ce Tarutaru !${prompt}
Th-that's an Aurastery doll! Which means you must be an agentaru of the Aurastery!${prompt};Yikes !
Ah...;C-c'est une poupée de l'Aurastère ! Ce qui signifie que vous devez être un agent de l'Aurastère !${prompt}
So, you've finally found me...${prompt};
But let me say this in my defense! I'm waiting for reinforcements from San d'Oria to arrive, so I haven'taru been able to move from this place.${prompt};Alors, vous m'avez finalement trouvé...${prompt}
Until the knights get here, I have to magically seal this area for the sake of the people of San d'Oria.${prompt};Mais laissez-moi dire ceci à ma défense ! J'attends des renforts de San d'Oria, donc je n'ai pas pu bouger d'ici.${prompt}
However, my concentration for maintaining the seal is being disruptarued. An Orc carrying ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} has been enspelling me from afar...${prompt};Jusqu'à ce que les chevaliers arrivent, je dois sceller magiquement cette zone pour le bien des gens de San d'Oria.${prompt}
This has further hamper-wampered my chances of getting outaru of here any time soon.${prompt};Cependant, ma concentration pour maintenir le sceau est perturbée. Un Orc portant ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} m’ensorcelle de loin...${prompt}
If Moreno-Toeno was the one who putaru you up to this, let him know of my situation.${prompt};Cela a encore plus entravé mes chances de sortir d'ici de sitôt.${prompt}
Ah, one more thing...${wait-animation: 1};Si c'est Moreno-Toeno qui vous a demandé de faire cela, faites-lui savoir ma situation.${prompt}
...Yah!${prompt};Ah, une chose de plus...${wait-animation: 1}
The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} has been drained of magic...;
I've been using my power to seal the brutish-wutish Orcish Overlord in the caves just beyond here. I mustaru continue my efforts until the reinforcements arrive.${prompt};Le ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} a été vidé de sa magie...
However, my concentration for maintaining the seal is being disruptarued. An Orc carrying ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} has been enspelling me from afar...${prompt};J'ai utilisé mon pouvoir pour sceller le brutalissime Seigneur Orc dans les grottes juste au-delà d'ici. Je dois continuer mes efforts jusqu'à l'arrivée des renforts.${prompt}
Ah! How did you...!?;Cependant, ma concentration pour maintenir le sceau est perturbée. Un Orc portant ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} m’ensorcelle de loin...${prompt}
You trouncy-wounced that nasty, curse-flinging Orc for me?;Ah ! Comment avez-vous... !?
This makes things so much easier.${prompt};Vous avez trouncé-wouncé cet horrible Orc lanceur de malédiction pour moi ?
But I'll tell you again! I can'taru leave here until the knights show up from San d'Oria to handle things.${prompt};Cela rend les choses beaucoup plus faciles.${prompt}
I'm holding the fortaru for as long as it takes the reinforcements to get here. They're taking their time about it, though.${prompt};Mais je vous le dis encore ! Je ne peux pas quitter ici jusqu'à ce que les chevaliers de San d'Oria arrivent pour prendre le relais.${prompt}
If I'm not here, the people of San d'Oria will be facing an awful-warful Orcish horde. That should be reason enough to placate Moreno-Toeno.${prompt};Je tiens le fort aussi longtemps qu'il le faudra pour que les renforts arrivent. Ils prennent leur temps, cependant.${prompt}
...Hm?;Si je ne suis pas ici, les gens de San d'Oria feront face à une horde Orc affreuse-wreuse. Cela devrait suffire à calmer Moreno-Toeno.${prompt}
Why did I run away from the Aurastery? That's something I prefer not to talk about...${prompt};...Hm ?
But I guess if I don'taru explain myself, you'll just drag me back to Windurst...;Pourquoi ai-je fui l'Aurastère ? C'est quelque chose que je préfère ne pas aborder...${prompt}
...Fine. This is just between you, me, and Moreno-Toeno...${prompt};Mais je suppose que si je ne m'explique pas, vous me ramènerez simplement à Windurst...
You probably already know about this, but Professor Koru-Moru has been exchanging lovey-dovey letters with a girl called Mojiji. Um, actually, the person writing those letters was me...${prompt};...Très bien. C'est juste entre vous, moi et Moreno-Toeno...${prompt}
Principal Koru-Moru had embezzled several years' worth of the Aurastery's budgetaru, and it didn't look like he would be giving it back. So, I thought I would take the name of Mojiji and try writing him a fan letter.${prompt};Vous le savez probablement déjà, mais le Professeur Koru-Moru échangeait des lettres d'amour avec une fille appelée Mojiji. En fait, la personne qui écrivait ces lettres, c'était moi...${prompt}
The effect of this was almostaru instantaneous. Every time I wrote him a letter, I convinced him to return a little more gil, but all the deception started to make me feel uneasy-queasy.${prompt};Le Principal Koru-Moru avait détourné plusieurs années du budget de l'Aurastère, et il ne semblait pas vouloir le rendre. Alors, j'ai pensé que je prendrais le nom de Mojiji et lui écrirais une lettre de fan.${prompt}
Before I knew it, every time I laid eyes on Professor Koru-Moru, I would feel a sharp pain in my stomach. It was a serious case of work-relatarued stress.${prompt};L'effet de ceci fut presque instantané. Chaque fois que je lui écrivais une lettre, je le convainquais de rendre un peu plus de gil, mais toute cette tromperie commençait à me rendre mal à l'aise.${prompt}
So I thoughtaru I would get away from the Aurastery for a little while, and go where I could find some solitude and peace.;Avant que je ne m'en rende compte, chaque fois que je posais les yeux sur le Professeur Koru-Moru, je ressentais une douleur aiguë dans l'estomac. C'était un cas grave de stress lié au travail.${prompt}
Then all this happened.${prompt};Alors j'ai pensé que je m'éloignerais de l'Aurastère pendant un moment, et que j'irais où je pourrais trouver un peu de solitude et de paix.
But since I didn'taru want to go back anyway, I decided to keep my whereabouts from the Aurastery.${prompt};Puis tout cela est arrivé.${prompt}
Does that explain things for you?;Mais comme je ne voulais de toute façon pas retourner là-bas, j'ai décidé de garder ma localisation secrète pour l'Aurastère.${prompt}
You can go back to the Aurastery and report that to Moreno-Toeno.${prompt};Cela explique-t-il les choses pour vous ?
When the reinforcements arrive from San d'Oria, I'll return to Windurst. The professor mustaru have forgotten about Mojiji by now.${prompt};Vous pouvez retourner à l'Aurastère et rapporter cela à Moreno-Toeno.${prompt}
Huh? He's still getting letters. But, I'm not writing them anymore!${prompt};Lorsque les renforts arriveront de San d'Oria, je retournerai à Windurst. Le professeur doit avoir oublié Mojiji maintenant.${prompt}
...Ah, justaru the person I wanted to see.;Hein ? Il reçoit encore des lettres. Mais, ce n'est plus moi qui les écris !${prompt}
There's something I wanted to ask you...${prompt};...Ah, juste la personne que je voulais voir.
How did you use that malevolent magic doll to track me down?${prompt};Il y a quelque chose que je voulais vous demander...${prompt}
The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!?;Comment avez-vous utilisé cette poupée magique maléfique pour me retrouver ?${prompt}
So this ring is what broughtaru about my discovery.;Le ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} !?
Well, I can't just throw it away...${prompt};Donc, c'est cet anneau qui a provoqué ma découverte.
Hmmm, what to do?;Eh bien, je ne peux pas simplement le jeter...${prompt}
Here, I'll give it to you for safekeeping. Please hold on to it until I return to the Aurastery.${prompt};Hmmm, que faire ?
I will return as soon as the reinforcements arrive from San d'Oria.${prompt};Tenez, je vais vous le confier pour le moment. Gardez-le jusqu'à ce que je retourne à l'Aurastère.${prompt}
Ah, dear old Windurst, how long has it been? I wonder if I still remember the way to the Aurastery?${prompt};Je reviendrai dès que les renforts arriveront de San d'Oria.${prompt}
The ${choice: 2}[orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.${wait-animation: 3};Ah, cher vieux Windurst, combien de temps s'est écoulé ? Je me demande si je me souviens encore du chemin vers l'Aurastère ?${prompt}
Come, ${name-player}.  Follow me...${wait-animation: 2};La lumière ${choice: 2}[orange/1/2/3/rouge/rouge/bleue/bleue/jaune/jaune/verte/verte/indigo/indigo/violette/violette]... Je peux sentir son pouvoir couler en moi.${wait-animation: 3}
Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.;Viens, ${name-player}. Suis-moi...${wait-animation: 2}
Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.;Carbuncle a disparu en direction du Plateau de La Theine.
The ${unknown: 0x01053082938280} jumps in your hands.;Carbuncle a disparu vers une autre zone du Plateau de La Theine.
Ahahahahaha!;Le ${unknown: 0x01053082938280} saute dans vos mains.
I can sense the power of the ring!;Ahahahahaha !
Get yourself moving ${choice: 5}[north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!;Je peux sentir le pouvoir de l'anneau !
Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the ${choice: 6}[north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!;Déplace-toi vers le ${choice: 5}[nord/nord-est/est/sud-est/sud/sud-ouest/ouest/nord-ouest] !
Ahahahahaha!;Ahahahahaha ! Ne ralentis pas maintenant, feignant ! Les lectures viennent du ${choice: 6}[nord/nord-est/est/sud-est/sud/sud-ouest/ouest/nord-ouest] !
You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!;Ahahahahaha !
Ahahahahaha!;Tu t'approches maintenant ! Je peux sentir le pouvoir de l'anneau depuis la zone suivante !
You're almost on top of it!;Ahahahahaha !
It's somewhere in this area!;Tu es presque dessus !
Lemme see here. Looks like you've brought me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. A deal's a deal, so here's the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};C'est quelque part dans cette zone !
They're not worth a whole lot, but ya done good to collect ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Here's ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} for yer trouble.${prompt};Laisse-moi voir. On dirait que tu m’as apporté ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Un marché est un marché, voici le ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
Whatcha got there? Looks like ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Guess that means I gotta give you this ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};Ils ne valent pas grand-chose, mais tu as bien fait de collecter ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Voici ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} pour ton effort.${prompt}
Here ya go, kid. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} in exchange for ya ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};Qu’est-ce que t’as là ? On dirait ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Je suppose que je dois te donner ce ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
Well, you make an old Gob smile, you do. Not many people hand over ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Take this ${item-singular: 2[2]} and get outta here.${prompt};Voilà, gamin. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} en échange de tes ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}
Now you're just showing off, bringing me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Here's your ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Now scram, kid.${prompt};Eh bien, tu fais sourire un vieux Gobelin, tu sais. Peu de gens remettent ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Prends ce ${item-singular: 2[2]} et file d’ici.${prompt}
Whaddaya want? You wanna talk to me? Well, I don't wanna talk to you until you got something I wanna hear. Take a hike, buddy.${prompt};Maintenant tu te la joues, en me ramenant ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Voici ton ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Maintenant, dégage, gamin.${prompt}
I got no interest in dealing with the likes of you. Don'tcha got a home to go to?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que tu veux ? Tu veux me parler ? Eh bien, je ne veux pas te parler tant que tu n'as pas quelque chose que je veux entendre. Va te promener, mec.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}?;Je n'ai aucun intérêt à traiter avec des types comme toi. T'as pas un chez-toi où aller ?${prompt}
Didn't think I'd ever hear those words from someone who wasn't a Gob. You know some weird stuff, for a person.${prompt};
There's a story that says some things have their own soul.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-plural: 2[2]} used to be just simple hourglasses. But as they passed through the hands of dozens of people, and even a few beastmen as well, the hourglasses were transformed by all their thoughts and feelings.${prompt};
They have the ability to focus mysterious powers. In our travels through all the lands of this world, us Goblins often come across this sorta thing.${prompt};
Now we come to the fun part. If you want a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}, I'd be willing to sell one to you. And you should know that only us Gobs can tell if an item has its own soul.${prompt};
You people--heck, even other beastmen--have no idea. I've seen you guys throw away these items like they were junk.${prompt};
They may look like garbage, but souled items are rare and valuable.;
You still want an hourglass, you gotta cough up ${number: 3} gil.${prompt};
${number: 1} gil for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, or ${number: 3} gil for ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
You want one, you hand me over the money.;
Like, with a quickness. So how's about it?${prompt};
What's that you got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
You're quite the collector for one o' your kind.${prompt};
It might just be a worthless piece o' junk for you, but it's priceless to us Gobs.;
If you want, I can take it off your hands for ${number: 1}.${prompt};
I add to my collection, you get some pocket change. A win-win situation, right?;
So just trade that ${item-singular: 0[2]} on over, why don't ya?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 2[2]}, ya say? Ya got my jaw dropping, kid. Where did ya hear about things like that?${prompt};
Did ya know that some items have their own soul? After passing through the hands of hundreds of people, not to mention the paws of us beastmen, some items are transformed through contact with all those thoughts and feelings.${prompt};
These transformed items have the ability to focus mysterious powers. Us Goblins often come across this weird phenenom...phemomeno...stuff in our travels.${prompt};
Ya know, if ya really want ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}, I could sell one to ya for the right price.${prompt};
But let me tell ya, kid. Only us Gobs can tell if an item is souled. Not even other beastmen--and definitely not you people--can tell the difference between normal junk and priceless artifacts.${prompt};
Makes me laugh to see you mugs throwing away those items like they was garbage.;
A souled item is worth a fortune, and ya ain't gonna get one cheap.${prompt};
${number: 3} gil, and not a single gil less! Ya got a problem with that, kid?${prompt};
So if ya want one, stop dawdlin' around already and hand me over some money.${prompt};
What's that ya got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!?;
Ya got unusual tastes for a person.${prompt};
Got no clue what ya been doin' with it, but I bet ya gots no use for it anymore.;
What say I lighten your load in exchange for, say, ${number: 1} gil?${prompt};
So whaddaya waitin' for?;
Hand that ${item-singular: 0[2]} right over and let's make a deal.${prompt};
I got a proposition for you.;
Before the Great War, a different currency was used in each of the three nations.${prompt};
But when gil became the coin of choice, all the other types of money were done away with.;
Now the old forms of currency are worthless to anyone besides a collector like me.${prompt};
You've never seen them before?;
Here, take a look at this.${prompt};
This is the least valuable type. It was part of the currency of ${choice: 7}[Bastok/Windurst].;
Since you were able to find out about the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, I'm guessing you'll be able to get your hands on a few of these.${prompt};
The three nations all had their different types of money, but I'm only interested in the old currency of ${choice: 7}[Bastok/Windurst].;
Collect enough of them and I'll trade you some other stuff I've got.${prompt};
One's not gonna be enough, though.;
You bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and I'll trade you a single ${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
You don't look real interested, but hold up. I'm just getting started.${prompt};
If you've got ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, I'll give you a ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Either that or I'll trade you for one of the goodies in my treasure hoard. They all go for a different price, however.${prompt};
The ${item-plural: 2[2]} are truly valuable. I'll give you some really great stuff for the right number of those beauties.;
You got all that? You wanna do business with me, then you better start looking.;
I'll be right here when you're ready to trade.${prompt};
I got a deal for ya, kid.;
Did ya know that before the Great War, the three nations all had their own currencies?${prompt};
After that little fracas, everyone started using gil as the standard coin, and the other types of money just faded out of existence.;
Even if you was to find any nowadays, they only have value to Goblin collectors like me.${prompt};
You're looking a bit confused there, kid.;
Let me show ya what I'm talking about.${prompt};
This one's the least valuable of the lot. It was used as a part of the San d'Orian currency years ago.;
I know I told ya about the nations all having different currencies, but these San d'Orian coins are the only ones I'm interested in.${prompt};
If ya bring me these coins, I'll exchange them for something from my secret stash of treasure. Ya won't be getting anything for just one of them, so make sure ya collect a bagful, okay?${prompt};
Let me explain the deal.;
Bring me ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, and I'll give ya one ${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
Where're ya going? Let me finish, will ya?${prompt};
Once ya got ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, ya can trade them for one ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Or, ya can decide to exchange them for something from my treasure stash. Each item's gonna cost ya a different amount, so choose carefully.${prompt};
For the right number of ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ya can choose from among the most valuable items in my hoard. 'Course, getting enough of them to trade with is another matter...${prompt};
Hmm? Was there something you wanted to ask me?${prompt};
What is it, kid? Ya got something to ask me?${prompt};
What do you want to ask about?;
${selection-lines};

Maps.;
Old currencies.;

I was telling you about how the three nations all used to have different types of money. You remember, right?${prompt};
Old currencies?;
I was telling ya about how the three nations all used to have different types of money. What, you forgot already?${prompt};
I didn't think there were people who loved this sorta stuff as much as I do. You really understand what things are worth.;
I don't give discounts, but you're welcome back anytime.${prompt};
Ya really like your junk, huh? That's what this stuff looks like to most people, and ya just spent a fortune on it. You're my kinda people, kid.${prompt};
By the way, I don't give out receipts, and I don't take back items I already sold.;
I don't know what ya mean to do with the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and I don't much care, so take it and skedaddle.${prompt};
By the way, I don't give out receipts, and I don't take back items I already sold.;
I don't know what ya mean to do with the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and I don't much care, so take it and skedaddle.${prompt};
Yeah, this is the real thing all right.;
You got some okay junk-collectin' skills for a person.${prompt};
So you wanna make a deal here?;
Should be a good one for the both o' us.${prompt};
Here's the list of stuff you can trade your ${item-plural: 0[2]} for.${prompt};

You got guts to come to this neck of the woods. I can see you ain't no ordinary adventurer, but you ain't the best yet, neither.;
Don't get your feathers ruffled, I just tell it like it is.${prompt};
Me, I'm a blacksmith, and a damn good one. My Goblin forgecraft can make the most worthless rusty piece of junk shine like new again. Looks like you take good care of your weapons, though.${prompt};
You got nothing for me to work on, so this conversation is over. I got better things to do than sit here and waste time trading insults with smart-alecky adventurers. Bye-bye now.${prompt};
Hold it right there, pal!;
Is that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you're carrying? The power hidden behind that worn appearance is making my old Gobbie ears twitch.;
Trust me, I'm a blacksmith. I don't kid around when it comes to weapons.${prompt};
Hrmmm.;
It'd take a lotta work, but I could make that power shine through again.;
Okay, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl], you got something to write with?${prompt};
To reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, I'm gonna need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Yep, that's the bare minimum.${prompt};
Bring along the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with those three items and I'll get to work for you.;
I've told you what I need, the rest is up to you.${prompt};
You got me what I need? Lemme see here, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Good work.;
Did I mention that I don't work for free? I'm gonna need a little something up front--don't trust you sneaky adventurer-types.${prompt};
Oh, and I got no interest in gil. My fee for this job is ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. You people pay each other for stuff all the time, right? Well, this ain't no different. You pay my fee, your weapon gets fixed up.${prompt};
Reforging the ${item-singular: 0[2]} is gonna cost you ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. You pay me and I start working. See you when you get back with my fee.${prompt};
You brought me my ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}? Right, time to get to work. My forge is hot and ready to go.${prompt};
The Goblin way of smithing is a little different from your fancy-schmancy “synthesis.” I'm gonna need some time to get this job done. You kept me waiting for the materials I needed, now it's your turn to cool your heels for a while. Fair's fair, right?${prompt};
You back already? I told you this was gonna take some time. You adventurer-types have really gotta learn some patience.;
Let me get back to work, will ya? Sheesh.${prompt};
You can stop your bellyachin' now--I'm done with your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. So what do you think? You ain't gonna see too many weapons of this quality, I can tell you. Be seeing you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
Oh yeah, one more thing: the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I worked on can still be improved. I can make that power shine even brighter than before. Do I have your full attention, now?;
Naturally, it's gonna cost you.${prompt};
The weapons you people use are really popular among the beastmen these days. I could make myself a small fortune with just a few of them.${prompt};
The top sellers at the moment are ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]}. There are others I could think of, but those three bring in the most cash. Don't forget to bring the ${item-singular: 0[2]} back with you, too.${prompt};
Those three items cover the cost of materials for reforging the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, but I'm still gonna ask you for a separate fee for my sweat and toil. To forge, or not to forge? The answer is in your hands.${prompt};
Oho, you brought me what I asked for? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. My pockets are gonna be bulging when I unload this stuff, heh heh.${prompt};
Now about that fee. As a craftsgoblin, it's embarrassin' to admit, but I don't think I can reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you. There's a blacksmith I know who can do the job, though. Damn expensive, but the best blacksmith I ever saw.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}. It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};
I don't have the skill to reforge the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you gave me, so I'm gonna take it to a blacksmith friend of mine. It'll be expensive, but the work is topnotch.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};
It's tough even for us Gobs to collect ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and you've brought me ${number: 2} of them. Not bad for a clueless adventurer-type. Leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me and the job will get done.${prompt};
You really are impatient, ain't you!;
This is gonna take a hell of a lot longer than last time--that's how amazing the outcome is gonna be. Better find something else to occupy yourself with for a while.${prompt};
This is gonna take so long, you'll forget you even asked me to do it in the first place. A really, really, really long time. Really long. But don't worry, I'm a true craftsgoblin, I won't go back on a deal. Just don't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};
And here you go, the finished masterpiece. Really, really, really sorry to keep you waiting so long. Really sorry. But take a look. Feel this radiating power. I bet you're glad you didn't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};
This reforging stuff just warms my old Gobbie heart. You find any more old weapons, be sure to bring them to me. You never know, they might have the same potential for enhancement you see here. See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
You can now request Switchstix to reforge a second ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Hold on, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]. I remember you...;
That ${item-singular: 0[2]} you've got there. Didn't I already reforge one for you?${prompt};
Don't tell me you want another...;
${selection-lines};
I do!;
No. Just forget it.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Hmmm......;
You know you can only carry one of those things, right?${prompt};
Let me get this straight. You want another, even though you know you can only carry one... And you people say us Gobbies are weird.;
Well, you know the routine. Bring me back the items and I'll start forging.${prompt};
===Weapon Reforging in Progress===;
Still ${number: 2} days and ${number: 1} hours until completion.;
Weapon in the forge: ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
“Trade” the ${item-singular: 6[2]} to the “Hieroglyphics” found in each area. The ${item-singular: 6[2]} will be transformed into ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
From that point on, one of the areas of Dynamis will be reserved by the bearer of the ${item-singular: 7[2]}. The destination and time to be spent in Dynamis will be recorded in the help text of the ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
By defeating certain enemies, a group can extend the amount of time they are allowed in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia]. Any time extensions will be reflected in the ${item-singular: 7[2]}'s help text.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 7[2]} creates a copy. By handing these copies out to other characters, it is possible to enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] in large groups.${prompt};
The number of characters that can enter Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] at one time is limited to ${number: 4} people.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 7[2]} can be duplicated further by those who have received a copy, essentially allowing for an unlimited number of ${item-plural: 7[2]} to be made.

Here's ya ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, and I get ta pocket the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Hey, you're the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal] with the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, right?;
I got some good news for you.${prompt};
Got a letter here from my blacksmith buddy, the guy who forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Wanted me to lay a proposition on you.${prompt};
For years now, him and his mates have been digging tunnels right under this place we're standin' on. Even among us Goblins, they're considered a strange crew.${prompt};
They're lookin' for a certain object that was buried here thousands of millions of years ago, or something like that. But don't worry your little head over whatever that may be.${prompt};
Anywho, after poking around deep under the earth for so long, they've come across a few strange weapons used by Gob-knows-who, Gob-knows-when.${prompt};
Now, this is the good part. The weapons those guys found happen to have the same sorta aura as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you're toting around. Pretty intriguing stuff, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
My buddy mentioned in his letter that he'd be willing to trade his discovery for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, as long as you throw ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into the bargain.${prompt};
Wait a sec...${item-singular: 1[2]}?;
Can't say I've ever heard of it myself. No description in the letter about it neither.${prompt};
Hrmmm. Guess if you want to swap your ${item-singular: 0[2]} for what they dug up, you better start looking for ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
Okay, I've done my bit and told you what you gotta do. It's adventure-time again.${prompt};
So this is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?;
Huh. I been all over the place and seen lotsa bizzaro stuff, but this is the first time I've seen something like this.;
You sure you're not a Gob?${prompt};
Righto, I'll take this stuff off your hands and we can get down to my favorite subject: extra fees. This one's really gonna cost you.;
Cha-ching! That'll be ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}, please!${prompt};
Collecting this sum is gonna be tough. Incredibly, unbelievably, ridiculously difficult. But I got faith in you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]!${prompt};
Your fee this time around is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}.${prompt};
My buddies are gonna hear about this--${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}! You shoulda been born a Gob!;
You can leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me.${prompt};
You ain't learned any patience on your travels, have you? And no, I'm not gonna tell some blabbermouth adventurer where my buddy hangs out.;
Look, I didn't cheat you last time, did I? Give a Gob a break and stop bothering me every five seconds!${prompt};
Oh, and you should be happy. There's no reforging to do, so this won't take nearly half as long as last time. Don't get so involved in your little adventures that you forget all about it, though.${prompt};
Good timing, your package has arrived. Definitely looks a lot like what you had in the first place...;
Hmmm. You're probably thinking this isn't worth the loot you had to part with, huh?${prompt};
Cheer up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].;
And don't forget to keep bringing me those ancient weapons. Who knows? They might be hiding some secret power that only a blacksmith like me can draw out.;
Here's what you came for.${prompt};
You hear a voice from somewhere...${prompt};
The voice has gone silent...${prompt};
What's up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl]?;
You get my attention, then you don't say anything. Are you feeling okay? You're acting kinda weird.;
I'm a blacksmith, not a doctor, you know.${prompt};
Whachya got there? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}?;
I told you to bring me any old weapons you find, but try to make sure they're in one piece, huh? ${prompt};
Doesn't matter how great a blacksmith I am, there's not much I can do with just ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}. Sometimes knowing when to give up takes more guts, as my old Gobbie granddaddy used to say.${prompt};
...;
Are you searching for me?${prompt};
Are you the one who is searching for me?;
Then prove it through your actions...${prompt};
My body will be made from ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. You will also need to prepare ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Once these things are gathered, come to the fortress built by the avians. There is a courtyard within...;
Do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};
If you do all this, I will show myself to you. I will be waiting...${prompt};
...;
Do you wish to possess me?${prompt};
Are you the one who wishes to possess me?;
Then show me the proof of your zeal.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my graceful form, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to be my flawless soul. And ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} will be my bond.${prompt};
Bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and these tokens to the forbidden forest in the east, to the base of the great tree that towers above all.${prompt};
Only then will your eyes behold my beauty.;
Until that day...${prompt};
...;
Dost thou need my power at thy side?${prompt};
Art thou the one who seeks my power?;
Then show me the strength of thine will.${prompt};
Seek thee out ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to be my spirit, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my physical form. And to buy my indulgence, ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Bring these baubles and the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the holy spring in the lair of the true dragon.${prompt};
And then shalt thou behold my true form...${prompt};
...;
Are you the one who has called upon me?${prompt};
Are you the one who desires my power?;
Do you seek the means to end the world?${prompt};
Then I will have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for my flesh, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to unbind my spirit. And I demand of you ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Take these offerings to the chasm of the land encased in ice, and seek out the water that lies at its end.;
Do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
Your efforts will be rewarded with a power beyond anything you have ever possessed.${prompt};
...;
You, wield me?${prompt};
You, want wield me?;
Me? Me hunger.;
You, bring. Me, sated.${prompt};
Me, body, strong axe, ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Me, heart, ${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
Me, value, ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
You, bring, me.;
South...? West...?;
Sand, much, island. Rock? Mountain?${prompt};
You, come?;
You, no forget bring ${item-singular: 4[2]}.;
You, be master, me.${prompt};
...;
You wish to see me?${prompt};
You wish to see the splendid hero sung of in legend?;
Then prove your love to me.${prompt};
I require the weapon, ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
I seek to possess ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
I desire the wealth of ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Gather my demands along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and venture upon the grand bridge, to the garden at the top of the tower.${prompt};
There I will grant you audience in all my glory.${prompt};
...;
Heh heh heh, you need me now, don't you?${prompt};
Whether it be fortune or disaster, your steps unwittingly lead you to me.;
You have approached the forbidden border...${prompt};
Very well.;
You will bring a weapon, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, to serve as my material shell. And ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} liberated from Dynamis, as well as ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Once you have all these things, thrust them into the great waterfall along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. You know the place I speak of?${prompt};
If you accomplish this feat, I will recognize you as my wielder.${prompt};
...;
You have been looking for me?;
For Odin's spear, the incarnation of lightning...?${prompt};
Do not try to hide your desire.;
You seek a force that topples armies, triumphs against sorcery, and approaches the power of the gods...${prompt};
A wise choice.;
First, seek ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Second, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a lance of unsurpassed quality, to act as my earthly manifestation. Lastly, you will bring me ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Take these along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and seek me out in the city in the clouds.${prompt};
If you succeed in discovering my decaying remains, I will see fit to realize your desire.${prompt};
...;
Am I the one you seek?${prompt};
If you do indeed wish to find me, I will ask of you an arduous task.${prompt};
As my blade I will have you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. And to guide my soul to that blade, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I also wish of you a bounty of ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Bring these things to the southeastern island, to the place where the bandits dwell. An old box will be the object of your search. Do not forget to bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
If you discover my resting place, I shall willingly fly to your side.${prompt};
...;
Am I the object of your search?${prompt};
Do you scour the land for my presence?${prompt};
Then gather unto yourself ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for my soul, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to be the cage to hold it. And I demand of you ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
You are to offer these to me, along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]}, on the peak of the mountain that looms above the forest and the city of knights.${prompt};
Then shall I willingly enter your service.${prompt};
Do you seek my strength?${prompt};
I am mightier than you could ever imagine.;
You seem powerful already. Do you still seek to possess that which is stronger?${prompt};
Very well.;
You will find me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to be my body, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to complement my soul. And you will offer me ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have these in your possession, take the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and venture deep into the forbidden forest. Look for the shining stone.${prompt};
I await your coming...${prompt};
...;
So, you are searching for me?${prompt};
I am the key to the gate of hell.;
And yet you search for me? Do not try to deny it.${prompt};
If you wish to wield my forbidden power, then bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a staff of uncommon craftsmanship.${prompt};
You will also require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} to free me from my chains.;
Do not forget to bring the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
This task will be harder than you believe. But if you succeed in gathering these things, bring them to the island overgrown with jungle, to the place that lies closest to the infernal flames.${prompt};
Once you have accomplished this, my unearthly power will be yours.${prompt};
...;
Do you quest for me?${prompt};
I knew it to be so.;
I was once the bow of a famous archer, but have since passed through many hands to my present masterless state.${prompt};
If you would draw me in battle, then I must have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a great bow, to be my foundation. You will also require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have these in hand, bring them with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the beach of the land to the west and the south.${prompt};
I will be waiting for you.${prompt};
...;
You are the one who hunts for me?${prompt};
You are aware of my reputation for destruction?${prompt};
If you still intend to own me, then I will have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, a weapon suitable to serve as my barrel. And I will have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} as further recompense.${prompt};
Once you have what I require, you will find me in the southwestern nation where the children who play with fire reside.;
And do not forget the ${item-singular: 4[2]}...${prompt};
I will be waiting.${prompt};
...;
Do you wish to play a tune with me?${prompt};
If you wish to hear my strident call, then you must collect my pieces.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is my bold timbre, and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will provide my body. And my music must be paid for with ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
When you have the parts I require, take up the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and come to the valley in the west where the wind blows its own symphony.${prompt};
Then I will break my silence for you...${prompt};
Good timing, your package has arrived. The letter mentioned something about the weapons being really similar, but I can see a few differences myself.;
Hmmm. You're probably thinking this isn't worth the loot you had to part with, huh?${prompt};
Third Stage/Reforge Complete;
Reforge of ${item-singular: 0[2]} complete.;
Now you have a new toy: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}${prompt};
Did I mention I fix up armor and shields as well?;
You wanna impress your friends with an old relic that shines like new, you know who to ask!${prompt};
Wait up, ${choice-player-gender}[adventurer-boy/adventurer-girl]!;
My Gobbie blacksmith instincts are telling me that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is hiding some real potential.${prompt};
Hrmmm. Hrmmm.;
It'll take a lotta work to put it back in shape, but this is the kinda thing I live for.;
Right, get your notebook ready.${prompt};
I don't work for that gil you adventurer-types love to hoard.;
What I'm gonna need is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Better throw in ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and don't forget ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
That's my fee.;
You gotta problem with fair trade? You pay me, I fix up your stuff.${prompt};
My fee for reforging your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
You pay me and I start working. See you when you get back with my fee.${prompt};
You got what I asked for? I count ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}. Looks like it's all here.${prompt};
Right, time to get to work. My forge is hot and ready to go.${prompt};
You can stop your bellyachin' now--I'm done with your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. So what do you think? You ain't gonna see too many pieces of this quality, I can tell you. Be seeing you, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
Oh yeah, one more thing: the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I worked on can still be improved. I can make that power shine even brighter than before. Do I have your full attention, now?;
Naturally, it's gonna cost you.${prompt};
The armor and shields you people use are really popular among the beastmen these days. I could make myself a small fortune with just a few pieces.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Plus ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and while we're at it, ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
It's gonna be a fun time getting your grubby little adventurer hands on the loot, but the result will be worth it.${prompt};
The fee, including my cut for the referral, comes out to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}. Plus ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}. Oh, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
It's tough even for us Gobs to get our hands on this old currency. Not bad for a clueless adventurer-type. Leave the ${item-singular: 0[2]} with me and the job will get done.${prompt};
And here you go, the finished masterpiece. Really, really, really sorry to keep you waiting so long. Really sorry. But take a look. Feel this radiating power. I bet you're glad you didn't forget to come back, huh?${prompt};
This reforging stuff just warms my old Gobbie heart. You find any more old armor or shields, be sure to bring them to me. You never know, they might have the same potential for enhancement you see here. See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[adventure-boy/adventure-girl].${prompt};
Got a letter here from my blacksmith buddy, the guy who forged your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Wanted me to lay a proposition on you.${prompt};
Anywho, after poking around deep under the earth for so long, they've come across a few strange bits of armor used by Gob-knows-who, Gob-knows-when.${prompt};
Now, this is the good part. The armor and shields those guys found happen to have the same sorta aura as the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you're toting around. Pretty intriguing stuff, wouldn't you say?${prompt};

Your fee this time around is ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}, and ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
My buddies are gonna hear about this. Look at all this loot! You shoulda been born a Gob!;

You will also require ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} as a sign of good faith.${prompt};
Bring these along with the ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the place by the channel where my wise servant rests his wings.${prompt};

${prompt};
Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
You're not wearing your yukata!;
Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!;
I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt};
Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!;
When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
Incredible, kupo!;
You must have nerves of darksteel!;
Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
You haven't earned my really special present yet!;
Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt};
Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?;
I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt};
Here, take this as a testament to your courage.;
Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt};
Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!;
Kupupupu...${prompt};
This place is crawling with nasties.;
You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt};
Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt};
I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.;
This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt};
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt};
Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.${prompt};
This is where the Tonberry from Carpenters' Landing told you to bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt};
You have nothing left to do here.${prompt};
There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt};
You are under attack!${prompt};
Nothing happens...${prompt};
Impressive...;
You don't look like one of Teulomme's lackeys.;
Who are you?${prompt};
Impressive...;
You don't look like one of Teulomme's lackeys.;
Wait...you're that adventurer.${prompt};
Hrmph.;
So you heard someone was threatening the count, and you were asked to find out who it was?${prompt};
So now that you've found me, it's straight to the Royal Knights, I suppose?${prompt};
No?;
What an unusual request you've undertaken.${prompt};
No?;
You always were one for undertaking unusual requests.${prompt};
Very well. Seeing as you've brought me the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, I should consider you a welcome guest.;
I'll let you in on a little secret about Count Teulomme.${prompt};
I assume you've heard of Atarefaunet's Band?;
Did you know their services could be bought for the right price?${prompt};
Even now, most people regard them as little more than a band of particularly vicious thieves.${prompt};
A client utilizing their talents for unsavory deeds could thus escape any incrimination.${prompt};
But after the war ended, the leader of the band, Atarefaunet, was captured by a pair of bounty hunters.${prompt};
Naturally, the band's clients were falling over themselves to have him silenced before all their dirty secrets came to light.${prompt};
One of those clients was our very own Count Teulomme.;
The man who lords it over the territory of Carpenters' Landing.${prompt};
The count realized that Atarefaunet would eventually be executed under San d'Orian law, but the condemned man needed to be taken care of before any inquisitions into his crimes had begun.${prompt};
And so, he bought off the oubliette guard and arranged for poison to be mixed with Atarefaunet's meal.${prompt};
But this was exactly what Atarefaunet was waiting for.;
Feigning death by poison was by far the preferable option to hanging or decapitation!${prompt};
Heh-heh...;
Atarefaunet used this opportunity to erase his existence from the world.${prompt};
And secrets that would cause apoplexy in half a hundred corrupt nobles went with him.${prompt};
How you use this knowledge is up to you.;
But I suggest you avoid doing anything to cross Atarefaunet--not if you're fond of your current breathing state.${prompt};
After his “death,” Atarefaunet slipped off to a nation in the west, yet rumor has it he's surfaced in these lands again.${prompt};
I don't know who your employer is, but for a normal townsperson this knowledge would be fatal.${prompt};
Take that as advice from the executioner.;

What's this? You have a message for me?${prompt};
What!? Captain Rahal has ordered you to deliver my report to him!? Wh-what should I do!?${prompt};
You see, messengers that I believe come from the Orcish empire in northern Quon have been turning up here quite often.${prompt};
I managed to listen in on their conversations, but I haven't been able to piece together the full extent of their plan just yet.${prompt};
From what I can gather, they appear to be collecting information about a special “egg” and that it lies somewhere within Quon's borders.${prompt};
Unfortunately, I haven't uncovered anything regarding their motives. So you see, until I can get more intel, I really don't have much to report.${prompt};
What should I do? If only I could steal a “map or something like that” from one of the messengers when they arrived...${prompt};
Yes, that's it. Surely an adventurer of your stature would have no problems with such a task?${prompt};
I'm quite certain an Orc with a map was headed for the Monastic Cavern. Please go there and see what you can find out.${prompt};
Truth be told, that Orc is a little too much for me to handle. I tried following him before, but I just ended up getting lost.${prompt};
Normally, that's not a problem for me. I'm thinking the Orcs must be using some kind of magic to alter the terrain...${prompt};
I listened in on the Orcs' conversation and they appear to be looking for some sort of “egg” in Quon.${prompt};
However, if I don't come up with any more details than that, I can't make a proper report to Captain Rahal.${prompt};
Therefore, I need you to head to the Monastic Cavern and get me that map, or whatever it is.${prompt};
You're back! So, did you have any luck!?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;

"It's the Northlands... I wasn't expecting this to be a map of the Beaucedine Glacier; it's a cursed land. And that “egg” they were referring to...${prompt}";
Whatever the Orcs are plotting, it gives me considerable worry.${prompt};
I'll continue my investigation here. In the meantime, take this map and my report.${prompt};
I need you to give them to Captain Rahal for me.${prompt};
Please make sure that this map and my report are delivered to Captain Rahal.${prompt};
I'll continue my investigation here. I have a bad feeling about this...${prompt};
