I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt};
After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt};
A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--;
Kupopo!?${prompt};
The moogle appears to have received a message...!;
G-grave news, kupo!!!;
Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt};
Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt};
Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!;
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt};
We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt};
To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
When you plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!${prompt};
Alright then!;
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!${prompt};
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!;
Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt};
A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt};
Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt};
But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! Great!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt};
The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! I like your enthusiasm!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have in your possession, kupo!${prompt};
Nooo, that ${item-singular: 0[2]} won't do.;
Come back again after you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo!;
You've absorbed ${choice: 0}[a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!${prompt};
Thanks, kupo.;
We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!${prompt};
You can purify absorbed malice by planting your ${item-singular: 0[2]} here.${prompt};
A mysterious power absorbs the malice!${prompt};

The Jeuno Straits separate our continent of Quon from the unknown lands of Mindartia. I was surprised to find it far narrower than I had thought.${prompt};
Crossing the straits, I arrived in the Sauromugue Champaign, the gateway to Mindartia. The Royal Knights of San d'Oria built a castle here in the heyday of that kingdom's power.${prompt};
The castle fell to a nighttime raid of three Tarutaru mages. The mighty knights routed, and their chocobos scattered. One by one they were driven into the straits. It became known as the Flight from Sauromugue.${prompt};
I began my survey here, in this blood-soaked land that has won a place in the studies of every San d'Orian officer. But history is history. You cannot walk forward if you only look back.${prompt};
I will befriend the Tarutaru and the Yagudo, so that peace may span across the continents.;

Since you are ${choice: 7}[a Hume/a Hume/a Hume/an Elvaan/an Elvaan/a Tarutaru/a Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka] who's much heavier than me, it was clever of you to remove your equipment before you started climbing.${prompt};
So, what do you think of the view?;
As you know, the monsters around here are not very friendly-wiendly, and not many travelers choose to pass through this place.${prompt};

She didn't make it back to the Tenshodo, did she?${prompt};

Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.♪${prompt};
This chocobo riding is a lot more painful than it looks. I think I'm starting to chafe.${prompt};
I wonder how much I could get for this at the local pawnshop...${prompt};

Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. You must equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
I can't work my moogle magic while you're involved in other events, kupo!${prompt};
You've helped our poor girl find her way home! I don't know how to thank you!${prompt};
And to think you made it here in a mere ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[hour/hours] (${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[minute/minutes] and ${number: 5} ${choice-plurality: 5}[second/seconds] Earth time)!${prompt};

Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!${prompt};

You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. You must equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
And that's not all!;
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};
Well done!;
On to the next one, kupo!${prompt};
That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt};
Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!;
If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt};
Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt};
The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt};

Oh my stars! This did not happen. Didn't happen.;
How could I have been so blind?;
I never even noticed someone was here with me. Never noticed.${prompt};
Oh, woe is me...;
I have fallen to the deepest blue depths of depression.;
Do you see how blue I have become?${prompt};
Do you see how blue?;
${selection-lines};
Oh yes, completely blue.;
You seem black and white to me...${prompt};
Of course you do!;
You are a child of Altana, after all!${prompt};
But...I thought a child of Altana would sympathize! Be sympathetic, you know?${prompt};
Oh!? What's this, what's this!?${prompt};
Who knew such a thing was possible!?${prompt};
What does this mean? What indeed?${prompt};
Could it be?;
Could it be you possess the same power...?${prompt};
The same power as me?${prompt};
My whiskers are twitching. They twitch.${prompt};
Shall I tell you what this means? Inform you?;
You possess the power to bend time itself.;
An ability bestowed only on the worthy.${prompt};
Although, it seems you lack the same control that I have.${prompt};
Uncontrolled, I would say.${prompt};
But this is good news, nonetheless.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The regal feline peers intently at ${name-player}.;
My intent, you see, is to help end this war before certain terrible, indelible wounds are gouged into history.${prompt};
Despite my best efforts, the nation of Elvaan knights devises pretentious plans that see them fall to the beastmen, time and again.${prompt};
The Humes ignore the unrest in their city, while Galkan rage reaches boiling point. The point of boiling!${prompt};
The Mithra squabble amongst themselves, and the Tarutaru dither as the Yagudo sack the city of Windurst. Sacking the city, they are!${prompt};
To confound matters, the alliance between the nations of Altana is still in its infancy, and old suspicions threaten to sever the tentative bonds. Bonds could be severed!${prompt};
There are only so many things I can do with these two small paws.${prompt};
...${wait-35: 3}${prompt};
Will you help me with this grand plan of salvation?${prompt};
If things are allowed to run their course, this war will spread to consume Vana'diel in a tidal wave of tragedy.${prompt};
I hope to shrink this tidal wave of tears, if only by a little. By a few drops.${prompt};
It will be difficult, thankless work. Thankless and difficult.;
But would you be up to the task?${prompt};
Are you up to the task?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do it!;
It's not my time...${prompt};
I'm sorry, I seem to have misheard you!;
Heard something amiss!${prompt};
I'll just ask you again, shall I?;
Are you up to the task?${prompt};
Wonderful!;
I feel my depression lifting already.${prompt};
The fate of this age rests on your shoulders!;
So much rests on you!${prompt};
Ah, I forgot to mention the Champions of the Dawn.${prompt};
It is prophesized that the Champions of the Dawn will appear in an age of strife and save the world from catastrophe.${prompt};
A band of heroes? A bevy of maidens? Who knows?;
Is this the age the prophecy foretells?${prompt};
I shall go forth and search for these champions with my mystical whiskers!${prompt};
So very busy! Busy indeed...${wait-35: 3}${prompt};
Hm?;
An introduction? Have we not been introduced?${prompt};
My name is Cait Sith.${prompt};
I am certain we shall meet again in the near future. Or would that be the near past?${prompt};
In any case, I wish you luck with your endeavors!${prompt};

“Elite training” is a section of the Field Manual which caters to dauntless adventurers who wish to engage in a more grueling test of their mettle.${prompt};
To participate in elite training regimes, you must acquire chapter transcripts, for which tabs are required.${prompt};
Trading ${item-plural: 35[2]}, gil, or a piece of equipment at designated locations (while in possession of a chapter transcript) will trigger the commencement of your training.${prompt};
Traded items will not be returned to you. You will, however, be furnished with rewards of correlating value upon the successful completion of each elite training regime.${prompt};
Even within elite training, there are regimes of varying difficulty. The trade limit for each succeeding chapter will be greater than the last, and the training objective more challenging.;
For safety reasons, all participants are recommended to be well prepared.${prompt};
Lastly, we at the A.M.A.N. recognize the importance of rest and recuperation as part of a healthy adventuring lifestyle. Therefore, a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all adventurers following the completion of an elite training regime. Until this time has elapsed, you will be unable to undertake further training, even if a chapter transcript is in your possession.${prompt};

${choice: 0}[Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend!;
Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm!;

What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!?;
Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!${prompt};
There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt};
What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!;
Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt};
We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.;
But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt};
There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.;
Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt};
Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.;
Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.;
It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt};
The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt};
In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.;
Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt};
Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt};
King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.;
How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt};
In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt};
“Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt};
Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.;
A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt};
We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.;
We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt};
Let's see...;
It appears that ${number: 0} moogle ${choice-plurality: 0}[tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.${prompt};

It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, glorious day!;
All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!${prompt};
Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air?;
You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...${prompt};
“Thrifty Transit”!;
A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer!;
For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!${prompt};
“Martial Master”!;
As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!${prompt};
“Blood of the Vampyr”!;
Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!${prompt};
“Treasure Hound”!;
With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!${prompt};
“Artisan's Advantage”!;
Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!${prompt};
“Myriad Mystery Boxes”!;
What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm!;
What genius could have devised such commendable creations?${prompt};
“Dilatory Digestion”!;
Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo!;
Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.${prompt};
“Boundary Buster”!;
Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo!;
It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!${prompt};
“Bountiful Bazaar”!;
Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!${prompt};
“Swift Shoes”!;
This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!${prompt};
“Crystal Caboodle”!;
Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!${prompt};
${prompt};
Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar.;
If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...${prompt};
What? What about the past, you say?;
Of course the magic won't travel through time.;
What a strange question, kupo...${prompt};
But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.${prompt};
The whole system is filled with mysteries.${prompt};
Oh, it's you! It's really you!;
The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!${prompt};
It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo!;
We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts.;
If you'll just sign right here...${prompt};
Sign for the moogle?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
Oh, thank you, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss]...${name-player}!;
A truly heroic name, kupo!${prompt};
As a reward for your efforts, please have this!;
Many thanks, and ${choice: 0}[safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!${prompt};
What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo.;
I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...${prompt};
If you change your mind, come back quickly.;
The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...${prompt};

Hi there! I'm ${related-entity}, your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant!;
I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt};
I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!;
You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Undertake training.;
Hear an explanation.;
What's the qualifying time?;
What's the fastest time?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that's just too bad!;
It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!;
The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt};
The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt};
But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.;
The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt};
Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt};
With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!;
Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt};
The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!;
When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt};
Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.;
The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt};
I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt};
Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt};
What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt};
Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt};
One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.;
But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?;
So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!;
And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt};
We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within ${number: 1} minute${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] ${number: 2} second${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young ${choice-player-gender}[wolf/vixen] like you, surely!;
And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt};
Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...;
But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!;
At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.;
All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...${prompt};
Give to the children?;
${selection-lines};
I live to give!;
Charity begins at home.${prompt};
But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...;
Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!${prompt};
You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated.;
Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?${prompt};
There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you.;
If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>${prompt};
So, are you ready-steady?;
${choice: 0}[Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO!;
Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!;
Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.${prompt};
But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!;
Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness.;
Let's start from the top, shall we?;
Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now?;
Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Hear an explanation.;
Where're the smile helpers again?;
Cancel the training.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face...;

The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};

Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.;
Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt};
By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt};
At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt};
That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt};
From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt};
But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt};
The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.;
As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt};
We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt};
Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.;
For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt};
Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt};

I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the ${choice: 0}[Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana].;
My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.${prompt};
I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Ask a bunch of questions.;
Participate in Voidwatch Ops.;
Request debriefing.;
Request ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
Check ${color: 5}voidstone${color: 1} stock.;
Request reward issuance.${prompt};
While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.${prompt};
Enlisted in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say?${wait-36: 2};
Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel.;
Come back again once you have proven your worth.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You must be at least level ${number: 0} to participate in Voidwatch.;
Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!${prompt};
I see you've yet to be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.${prompt};
You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or “jurisdiction.”${prompt};
Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.${prompt};

When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.;
The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.${prompt};
Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!${prompt};
Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.${prompt};
You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.;
This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.${prompt};

“Voidwalker” is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.${prompt};
Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt};
While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt};
As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt};
To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt};
Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt};
Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt};
Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.;
Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt};
These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.;
They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt};
Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt};
The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt};
That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt};
Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt};
Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt};
Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt};
You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt};
Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt};
The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt};
When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt};
However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt};
Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt};
Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt};
But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt};
You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.;
In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt};
The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt};
To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt};
One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt};
All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt};
Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt};
For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt};
In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt};
Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt};
If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt};
Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.;
It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt};
Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt};
Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt};
Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.;
They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt};
(Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt};
They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt};
Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt};
Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.;
But I digress...${prompt};
Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt};
As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.;
Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt};
It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.;
Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt};
Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt};
Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt};
The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt};
I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt};
I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt};
Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt};
Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt};
Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.;
Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt};
And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt};
I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.;
Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt};
As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.;
Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt};
Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt};
Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.;
There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.;
Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt};
Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?;
Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt};
As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.;
Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt};
The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.;
Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?;
Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt};
At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.;
Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt};
If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt};
Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.;
The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt};
Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt};
"Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}";
Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt};
It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt};
If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt};
Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt};
As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.;
There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt};
Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt};
Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.;
If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt};
As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt};
Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt};
Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt};

Hmmm.;
Sorry, but I don't think you have what it takes to survive these underground caverns.${prompt};
Have you heard of the Meebles before?${prompt};
They're a subterranean race of beastmen that strikingly resemble moles.;
No need to get your britches in a bunch if you haven't, though--studying them is our job.${prompt};
We, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, have left no stone--figurative or real--unturned in our search for answers about this elusive species.;
Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt};
They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work throughout a network of burrows.${prompt};
Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?;
Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt};
Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?;
We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt};
Oho, I knew it was a good idea to prepare this grimoire.;
Here, it should help with your research.${prompt};
It looks like you can't carry any more. Try emptying some articles out and return when you have the room.${prompt};
Hahaha, you look like you've just been thrown from a chocobo!;
No need to be scared. I'll explain the process as best I can, but feel free to ask if I've missed something.${prompt};
Let's see if I can do this. First, form a party of one to six people.;
Next, trade your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt};
If the need arises, I can always transport you there.${prompt};
Alright, here goes nothing. First, form a party of one to six people.;

After that's done, you're ready to go spelunking...unless you're the party leader.${prompt};
Then you'll have to talk to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher/me/me] again to decide which expedition to undertake.${prompt};
I must warn you, though, that some expeditions require everyone to make a unanimous decision.${prompt};
Once your party's expedition has been chosen, it's time to go spelunking.${prompt};
Have your party leader talk to the Meeble guarding the burrow entrance.;
He'll escort you to the right research site.${prompt};
After you've finished an expedition, use ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to return aboveground and report to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher in charge or me/me/me] to get your grimoire back.${prompt};
Now for a word about grimoires.;
They impart various benefits depending on what expeditions you've completed.${prompt};
It's dangerous down there, so be sure to make use of your grimoire.${prompt};
Finally, while there are many types of grimoires, they all share the same attributes.;
Feel free to change them out depending on your companions and the research assignment at hand.${prompt};
You must be the explorer my compatriot in Jeuno was talking about. What brings you here?${prompt};
Well, well, look who it is.;
What do you need this time?${prompt};
Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.${prompt};
We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!${prompt};
I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for “nefarious deeds” once again.${prompt};
Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives!;
Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.${prompt};
How, you ask? By collecting as much information as possible through new expeditions and finally getting to the bottom of this Moblin nuisance! We're always in need of proven researchers like yourself, should you wish to join in the action.${prompt};

Any questions?;
${selection-lines};
No, not right now.;
How does this whole research thing work?;
I...descend into underground caves!?;
What are these grimoires about?;
How do I begin an expedition?;
What goes on after an expedition?;
What dastardly foes lurk down below?;
Any rhyme or reason to these burrows?;
What are research marks?;
Can you tell me about the Meebles?;
What is grimoire engraving?;
Could you tell me about wizened worms?;
Palimpsests? Huh?${prompt};
You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.;
The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt};
Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.;
Be careful.${prompt};
Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt};
Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.;
However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt};
Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt};
Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.;
Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.${prompt};
What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.;
Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt};
Like I said, they're no picture books for children.;
They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.${prompt};
These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice!;
See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.${prompt};
Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.${prompt};
Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions.;
Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.${prompt};
At the moment we only have ${number: 0} types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.${prompt};
When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt};
When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to me.${prompt};
Once you do that, ${choice: 0}[he'll/I'll/I'll] dole out ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Those're the only supplies you'll need to start spelunking, but not so fast. You first have to decide what expedition you'll undertake.${prompt};
I'll help you make the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt};
It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots.;
The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt};
Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.${prompt};
It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you're allowed to choose any expedition you've already proven your worth on.${prompt};
Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt};
After signing up, you'll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt};
They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt};
...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.;
I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt};
Don't worry, this method is tried and true.;
Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt};
That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you're the only one who isn't carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they'll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt};
In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt};
Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you're free to experiment all you want.${prompt};
...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt};
There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt};
Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt};
They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt};
Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.${prompt};
You'll be given ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} after completing an expedition.${prompt};
One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt};
After making your escape, there's only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
After making your escape, you can show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to me.${prompt};
${choice: 0}[One of us will/I'll/I'll] reference the data you've collected and catalog it in your grimoire.${prompt};
If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} instead.${prompt};
Sadly, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} allows only its bearer to come up for air.;
Don't forget to show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.${prompt};
There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.;
You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.${prompt};
Oh, and if you've been wondering how to get ahold of one of these ${item-plural: 3[2]}, you'll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.${prompt};
Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.;
Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt};
Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.;
That's why.${prompt};
Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt};
Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt};
That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.;
Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt};
Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt};
This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt};
In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt};
This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt};
This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt};
Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren't stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt};
That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).;
We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt};
You should also know that we only give out one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} every ${number: 1} ${choice: 3}[hour/minute]${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt};
We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...;
How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt};
It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt};
On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.;
Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt};
I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.;
If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt};
Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt};
In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You'll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt};
How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt};
We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt};
How do you get them? It's simple.;
The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt};
There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.;
The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt};
Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt};
They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt};
Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?;
Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt};
Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?;
We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt};
I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt};
But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt};
Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt};
Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt};
We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt};
Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.;
Let me explain.${prompt};
If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt};
Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt};
Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.;
It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt};
Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt};
According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt};
Palimpsests?;
I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt};
The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt};
Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.;
Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt};
Except it's not!;
Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt};
Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.;
These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt};
All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt};
I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt};
Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt};
If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.${prompt};

Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...in the name of knowledge!${prompt};
This expedition involves collecting data at certain Points deep within the caverns...stealthily. Don't get found by anything there, or you'll come back empty-handed.${prompt};
Like moths to flame, the beasts in these caves are attracted to Subterranean Safepoint fire. Extinguish the torches to disperse the hordes...but not too fast. Extinguish multiple ones at once and you'll attract unwelcome guests.${prompt};
“Endeavor to find the most expeditious route from the specified points to increase research productivity.” Wow, you'd think whoever made this objective could be a little more direct. Anyway, you may not need this advice, but try not to get found by any enemies along the way.${prompt};
Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...without injuring any Snarling Meebles, for they're the subject of our research at the moment.${prompt};
For the cost of just a few ${item-plural: 3[2]} an expedition, you too can help save the lives of starving Meebles. Please, think of the Meebles and do the right thing.${prompt};
This expedition aims to improve research efficiency by having you find the shortest route from point myeh to point gah. Oh, those names aren't the product of apathy on my part.;
I'm subtly hinting that the routes change depending on the time of day you enter. Whoops, so much for subtlety.${prompt};
Those Varanefts and Tectochuks are enigmas wrapped in riddles encased in gobs of mystery. Yummy, yummy mystery.;
This expedition tasks you with unwrapping and sucking every last drop of mystery out of their behavior.${prompt};
We'd like you to develop an intimate relationship with certain subjects down there. The catch is that they're not very friendly, so you'll need to endure some of their blows first. Go unconscious, though, and it'll be harder to collect the right data.${prompt};
Ready for a little reconnaissance?;
We need someone to clear the way for “big boys” to do “real researcher's work.” Pompous jerks.;
Anyway, this sounds obvious, but try not to get knocked out, okay?${prompt};
Treasure for everyone! The MBEC has unearthed lots of chests down belowground!;
Experience has proven that some of those chests are just monsters lying in wait, though...so we've decided to send adventurers down there first.${prompt};
Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...which may require you to go for a swim!${prompt};
“Even filthy bloodsuckers like Hirudinids and Stagdellas can offer scientific insights,” my tail!;
We've tried everything and haven't found a single piece of data worthy of analysis, so...uh...try slaying them at the same time? I don't know.${prompt};
“Just when we thought it was okay to implement the scientific method again, our fellow researchers get attacked by notarizing monarchs!”;
Wait a minute! When I find the dolt who wrote this report...${prompt};
You've researched the rest, so now it's time to take on the best! Brave close encounters with the burrows' most feral fiends to receive glory, gil, and ${choice-player-gender}[girls/guys]!;
...Wait, we don't have the funds for those last two.${prompt};
The goal of this expedition is to compile data regarding certain points within the burrows. The area is crawling with annoying Mafic Maroliths, though. We know that they possess a hive mentality, so as long as you take some down, the others should get the point.${prompt};
Ever feel like you're being watched? I do all the time.;
My superiors tell me that our activities are being monitored by enemies...though not by the evil rarab in my closet, as I'd suggested. But what do they know!? Try and beat them at their own game and best them without getting detected. Then maybe I can get some sleep at night.${prompt};
The Meebles we were observing have been attacked!;
Oh, the Galkanity! The Elvaanity! The...I'm so flustered I can't think!;
Please save them! Without their cute little snouts and endearing gruff talk, what else is left in the world to enjoy!?${prompt};
Like moths to flame, the beasts in these caves are attracted to Subterranean Leohtfaet fire.;
Extinguish the torches to disperse the hordes...but not the Meebles. Spare the Meebles at all costs.${prompt};
Those adorable Meebles are at it again, collecting ${item-plural: 3[2]} like they were real miners. Indulge them in their harmless fantasy and try finding ${item-plural: 3[2]} at mining points throughout the caves. Pretty please?${prompt};
Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible.${prompt};
The goal of this expedition is to compile data regarding certain points within the burrows.;
For this one, they've even been pre-numbered for you! All you need to do is examine them in order from youngest to oldest.;
What, that's not how you say it? You mustn't be from around here.${prompt};
Those dastardly little buggers are breaking our Burrows Depthmarker!;
Show them that science always shines brightest by defending the Burrows Depthmarker for as long as possible!${prompt};
On this expedition, you'll have to make as many hot-tempered bombs as possible self-destruct.;
Sounds like your best bet is to insult their cooking. Thanks, I'll be here for all eternity.${prompt};
Moblins are supposedly gathering certain “elaborate parts” from treasure chests and fallen fiends. We don't know exactly what manner of confounding contraption they intend to contrive, but bring us enough parts and we'll <ahem> “piece it together.”${prompt};

Well, if this isn't the cat's meow. There is something you wish to ask of me? Hoping to have me shed some light on a particular matter?${prompt};
...This is wholly unexpected.${prompt};
I've seen futures both brighter and darker, but in each at least there was a future.${prompt};
Ah, but those feathered wings represent a new hope. A possibility to ensure that what should come to be...does come to be.${prompt};
Perhaps it's best if we not paw around here, and consult Atomos instead. Ask his opinion.${prompt};
Which means that you'll have need of this.${prompt};
This should provide entry into what we call the “Walk of Echoes.”${prompt};
The entrance there is the same as the entrance here--a cavernous maw. Gaping expanse of space.${prompt};
${name-player}, you have come. Shown your face before me.${prompt};
Alexander's cry has reached my ears.${prompt};
Ah, I have awaited you. Hoped for this chance.${prompt};
Unfurling here before you is the Walk of Echoes.${prompt};
If you look above, you will see the prime avatar Atomos given physical form...${prompt};
Or so you would think. No, the entire Walk of Echoes itself is Atomos. Its body and soul.${prompt};
Some refer to him as the destroyer of worlds, for he feeds on futures that shall not come to pass. Whose existence is forbidden.${prompt};
I trust you remember that Atomos consumes all futures that are forbidden.${prompt};
And I'm sure the one question that must be pulling at your mind--bothering you to no end--is why Atomos is not feasting on your “dark future” as we speak.${prompt};
I, too, have pondered that very question, and I will not play cat and mouse with you--that future is not a forbidden one.${prompt};
There is nothing that I can do, what with Atomos so intricately connected to the laws of this world. So important to the way Vana'diel plays out.${prompt};
Oh? That's not why you're here?${prompt};
Why are you here?;
${selection-lines};
I need Iroha to be accepted.;
No real reason.${prompt};
Come, come. We all know that's a bald-faced lie. Nothing could be further from the truth.${prompt};
Out with it. You'll never get what you wish for unless you ask.${prompt};
What a perplexing conundrum.${prompt};
I am quite lucky to have been protected by the Goddess, but you...a great pair of white wings has wrapped you in its embrace, although I'm hard-pressed to say why. I haven't got a whit of an idea.${prompt};
But those without such a boon cannot traverse the boundaries of time.${prompt};
Why would you think there would be a means to save her?${prompt};
You should count your blessings that Phoenix felt the need to save her at all. Most would have been left by the wayside.${prompt};
Why that dour look? Don't tell me you're going to come mewling some trite complaint.${prompt};
Well?;
${selection-lines};
Of course I'm upset!;
Isn't there anything we can do?;
I...suppose not.${prompt};
An unsurprising response, to be sure.${prompt};
Of course you're upset. It's understandable.${prompt};
Forgive my starkness. A thousand apologies.${prompt};
But don't mistake my honesty for callousness. Your story has shook me to the bones. Sent a chill up my spine.${prompt};
I'm still letting it sink in--a force so mighty it can charm even Siren, the very mistress of seduction.${prompt};
I'm positively at the end of my rope. My wits' end.${prompt};
...But there's still another option.;
Surely I don't need to tell you who Altana is.${prompt};
Never once have I been able to set eyes on her.${prompt};
But you...${prompt};
A day may yet come when you will be able to see her in person. Become the most intimate of acquaintances.${prompt};
Because you and yours are children of the Goddess.${prompt};
And you bear a brighter future on your wings.${prompt};
Wait! I have an idea. A flash of inspiration.${prompt};
Altana may be able to provide Iroha the succor she seeks.${prompt};
And if she can set everything right...it makes my whiskers twitch!${prompt};
Her love is eternal, and surpasses the very laws of our world.${prompt};
Of course, this leaves us the one small problem of how exactly you go about communing with her...${prompt};
However, I know of a “fabulous” person who might have an answer...${wait-36: 2};
Lilisette.${prompt};
I'll see if I can bring her to you. But it'll take some time.${prompt};
Your first order of business should be to set things right in this world. Help subjugate the forces that threaten it.${prompt};
I'll claw at the problem from a couple different angles in the meantime.${prompt};
But never give up--spread your wings and soar to the heavens!${prompt};
Aha!;
${name-player}, it's you! Did you happen upon ${choice: 2}[that regal cat/Cait Sith] again?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Then I have a stranger question: have you been having any odd dreams lately?${prompt};
${name-player}...;
A first reunion was surprising enough, but a second!${prompt};
This isn't going to be a happy one either, is it? What happened?${prompt};
Cait Sith was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I couldn't pluck the answers off her.${prompt};
All I know is that it's got to be related to those dreams I've been having. You've seen them too, haven't you?${prompt};
Is this another one of my dreams?${prompt};
I've seen all manner of disturbing dreams lately. Perhaps because of Lilith's dark future...${prompt};
You've seen similar ones too, haven't you?${prompt};
Have you had odd dreams?;
${selection-lines};
Not dreams, but visions...;
Not really.${prompt};
I knew I couldn't have been the only one!${prompt};
They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.${prompt};
Are you quite sure?${prompt};
They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.${prompt};
I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.${prompt};
I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.${prompt};
Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.${prompt};
Huh? You had a different dream?${prompt};
Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!${prompt};
Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?${prompt};
Then in my dreams...all that light...;
Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?${prompt};
What kind of trickery is this!?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I'll think of something.;
I need your help.;
...${prompt};
Oh, I see how it is. You're going to run off and save the world!${prompt};
Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!${prompt};
And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?${prompt};
You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...${prompt};
Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.${prompt};
${name-player}, you're really something else.${prompt};
You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.${prompt};
I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.${prompt};
Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?${prompt};
Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.${prompt};
We might have to rack our brains for this one...${prompt};
S-sorry for stepping out of line.${prompt};
I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.${prompt};
After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!${prompt};
So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?${prompt};
We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.${prompt};
Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.${prompt};
Oh? What is...;
Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?${prompt};
That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!${prompt};
Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!${prompt};
${name-player}, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.${prompt};
You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!${prompt};
Something awful's happened! Not good at all!;
If it isn't that odd kitty cat!;
Cait Sith...? What's wrong?;
${name-player}, it's about that ambassador “friend” of yours. The person you've been looking for.${prompt};
He found his way ${choice: 2}[here/to the Walk of Echoes]!${prompt};
The Walk of Echoes?${prompt};
Oh dear. Here. I'll let ${name-player} explain the rest. Fill you in on the particulars.${prompt};
I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!${prompt};
How terrible must this foe be if he's managed to make his way ${choice: 1}[to this world/to the Walk of Echoes]?${prompt};
${name-player}, I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!${prompt};
Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!${prompt};
Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!${prompt};
That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.${prompt};
Together we have the strength to conquer the darkness!${prompt};
I'll be waiting for you in the Walk of Echoes.${prompt};
And this Walk of Echoes...we can get there from a cavernous maw?${prompt};
Got it! I'll meet you there!${prompt};
