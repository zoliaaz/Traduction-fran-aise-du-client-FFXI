${choice: 0}[Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!];
It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
Why, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!${prompt};
I wish you speed upon your journey.${prompt};
You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.${prompt};
Come back when you have the requisite certification.${prompt};
Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.${prompt};
Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?;
Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt};
The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt};
Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt};
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};
You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt};
In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt};
One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt};
Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt};
The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt};
You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt};
There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt};
The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt};
When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt};
A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt};
The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt};
I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt};
Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of ${number: 0} imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt};
It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt};
The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt};
The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt};
We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt};
The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt};
The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt};
We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt};
Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt};
The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt};
Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt};
We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt};
Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt};
The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt};
It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt};
Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number ${number: 1}.${prompt};

Behavioral research.;

Nothing.${prompt};
Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt};
It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt};
The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt};
Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt};
If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt};
While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt};
Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt};
For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt};
Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt};
You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt};
By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt};
The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt};
Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt};
Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt};
The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt};
Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt};
The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt};
The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt};
While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt};
Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt};
This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt};
Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt};
The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt};
Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt};
This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt};

Those twitherym here in Ulbuka are adorable! I want to give them a big huggy-wug!${prompt};
Have you ever seen a twitherym? They're creatarus with exquisite wings made of pure beauty, and they live deep within the jungles.${prompt};
Stories abound of the magic contained in the dustaru their wings leave behind. Fathom that!;
So...I got to thinking. Maybe-waybe we can use that magic to help the colonization effort!${prompt};
But every rose has its thorns. Not even experienced pioneers have laid so much as a finger-winger on them.${prompt};
Yet there may be another way! They imbibe the sap from local trees, gaining nourishmentaru from the vitamins and minerals within. When they dance around the trees, their wings flutter and deposit trace amounts of dusty-wust on the sap, which then runs down the trunks and limbs.${prompt};
That's where you come in, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Missus] Pioneer. Can you find some of this sap and deliver-wiver it to me? Think of the research! Think of the possibilities!${prompt};
The butterflies nest to the south of here, where the most succulentaru trees reside. Take a gander and see if you can't locate any sap!${prompt};
Stupendous-wendous! The sap you've brought back contains more dust than I could have hoped for!${prompt};
So much progress in so little time! This sends my research forward by monthy-wonths! Only a tad longer and I'll be able to concoctaru something that'll knock the pioneering world flat on its backside!${prompt};
Until then, I presentaru you with a token of my esteem.${prompt};
The sap contains a faintly glimmering dust.${prompt};
You already have enough sap.${prompt};
<Sigh> Pioneering, pioneering...I came here to colonize the jungle, not fight endless hordes of monsters!${prompt};
At least we've managed to establish a foothold...not that it's done us much good.${prompt};
There's a mantid here that's a particular blight on the land. Not satisfied to simply eat other vermin, it turns its mandibles on us as well!${prompt};
Most mantids reside somewhere north of here, but this one has migrated south to wreak havoc upon those of us unlucky enough to get within reach of its razor-sharp claws.${prompt};
I'd like to exterminate the pest, but I have little training in either sword or spell. Could you teach them that we pioneers mean business?${prompt};
I can tell you the best way to take care of it. Those foul vermin devour chapuli the way you or I would devour steak, so if you use a chapuli as bait you should be able to lure it out into the open.${prompt};
When it's caught you in its pincers, survival comes down to your skills. Give it what it deserves, but don't get cocky. If you succeed, I'll have a little something for you when you come back.${prompt};
Some part of me thought you would fail--but I'm glad you proved me wrong! Now we should have an easier time opening Eastern Ulbuka to the masses.${prompt};
But I fear that the mantids aren't our biggest enemy. As we progress further into the continent, we keep finding greater threats that dwarf what we have seen to date.${prompt};
Our ancestors chose to spurn pioneering efforts many centuries ago, erecting Jorius Yett to keep us safe from the horrors of Ulbuka...and now I can see why.${prompt};
I can't shake the feeling that there's something out there, waiting for us to make a misstep. When that time comes, we'll all be counting on you.${prompt};
For now, though, I promised you a reward. Take it with my thanks.${prompt};
What's this? You still have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Here, let me take it off your hands.${prompt};
A vast amount of unknown objects lie scattered about the ground.${prompt};
I'm starting to get really sick of these pesky wasp nests...${prompt};
You there! You look like you can handle yourself with my little wasp hive problem. To be a bit clearer, the things themselves aren't the problem--it's what resides inside them.${prompt};
If they were empty, I'd go get rid of the lot myself. But look at me--do I look like I can go taking a mace to a monster?${prompt};
No, no I cannot. That's why I'm looking for someone to smash into the nests and take care of some of the belaboring wasps inside.${prompt};
A number? You really want a number to kill? <Sigh> I want to say “as many as you can,” but you've probably got better things to do...so let's say ${number: 1}. Does that sound doable?${prompt};
You actually went out and killed them for me? What a pal! Hopefully they didn't sting you too much.${prompt};
There's something I didn't tell you--those wasps you took care of barely scrape the honeycomb of what's out there.${prompt};
No, much more fearsome beasts exist in Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt};
Have you ever heard tales of the Naakuals? These loathsome creatures are demigods of the region, beasts of immense power that make other dangers look like bothersome Goblins.${prompt};
Children are told fairytales of one Naakual making the Ceizak Battlegrounds its domain. Yet in recent months, pioneers have reported sightings that send chills down the spines of Adoulin's governing body.${prompt};
<Whisper> I have said too much. They have eyes and ears everywhere. <Cough> For now, accept your just reward for a task well done.${prompt};
You there! This forest is no place for the likes of you! Run back home to mommy before you get yourself killed!${prompt};
<Grunt> Another pioneer come to “brighten up my day”? Bah. If you really want to prove yourself as a member of the Pioneers' Coalition, you're going to have to learn a few tricks.${prompt};
What do I mean? Any staunch veteran would know that the jungle has grown at a dizzying pace over the past few years, owing to some force that we cannot even begin to fathom.${prompt};
But all you naive pioneers from the Middle Lands come waltzing into Ulbuka, thinking you can just chop down trees to clear the way--but it's not so simple. Damn things sprout up again like weeds.${prompt};
${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is necessary to even have a prayer of proceeding further into the jungle.${prompt};
Such techniques will help you clear a path deeper in--not that I'd expect you to be able to put up a fight against the savage beasties there anyway.${prompt};
So? We going to do this or not? If you want to learn about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} skill, you're gonna have to join a Colonization Reive!${prompt};
Well, well, the unexpected has happened. You already have the requisite colonization experience.${prompt};
I suppose it's time to teach you about the skill ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} so that you can slash through groves of trees like bottles of frontier soda.${prompt};
Now take a look--a little chop here, a hack there...${prompt};
You may be a bit green still, but I trust that you've now learned the basics of ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Now get back to pioneering before I kick your butt all the way to Adoulin.${prompt};
We've still got a lot to learn if we're going to colonize the land, but with pioneers like you around...it'll take twice as long.${prompt};
Keep on fighting and discovering more about the land, and one day I might just recognize your potential. Not that I'll get my hopes up.${prompt};
Think of Colonization Reives as training to learn about ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and maybe that'll keep you from crying all over my tunic.${prompt};
Well now, this does come as a surprise. You actually learned a bit about colonizing.${prompt};
I can sense the thirst for knowledge deep within you. Too bad you're too dull to absorb it all. <Sigh> No harm trying, though. Ready to learn ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};

${color-alt: 15}${name-player} has collected a soil sample!${prompt};
Just when I thought those two good-for-nothings had turned over a new leafkin, it turns out it's just a pioneer doing their dirrrty work.${prompt};
${name-player}! What are you doing here? Don't tell me those two good-for-nothings got you to do their dirrrty work?${prompt};
I came all the way out here to see their progress only to learn that they're currrled up back in Adoulin.${prompt};
That is what happened, isn't it? The scarrredy-cats begged you to come out here for them.${prompt};
Tell the truth?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Let sleeping cats lie.${prompt};
I figurrred as much. Here, let me take that dirt off your hands.${prompt};
You can't fool me so easily. I wasn't borrrn yesterday.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} hands the dirt over to Lhe Lhangavo.${prompt};
Rrridiculous. I knew they had no spines, but this...${prompt};
We've alrrready left the woods to you pioneers, and now my own men won't even do the most basic of tasks.${prompt};
Everything was different when Shla was arrround.${prompt};
Who's Shla? Shla Kheefid, my partner back in the day.;
The two of us often visited the forrrest.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition hadn't yet been established, and it was difficult to get purrrmission to go exploring.${prompt};
We caused the soldiers no end of consterrrnation with the way we went out to the forest during the day and came back late at night.${prompt};
But we were never brrrave enough to venture into the farthest depths.${prompt};
We prrromised that we would never go there without the other.${prompt};
The two of us spent many days imagining what awaited us there in the rrrecesses of Eastern Ulbuka.${prompt};
One day, though...Shla chose to head out by herself--and she was neverrr heard from again.${prompt};
It was about then when there was talk of forrrming the Pioneers' Coalition, but by that time I couldn't bring myself to go out anymore.${prompt};
Eventually I came arrround, in large part thanks to the way the Coalition looked after me.${prompt};
I vowed that sooner or later I would venturrre into the forest depths and see what lies beyond.${prompt};
Maesteeeeeer!${prompt};
And now these two decide to show up, screaming bloody murderrr.${prompt};
You maggots are complete failures! Shoving off your workload like that!${prompt};
<Gulp> Sh-she found out...${prompt};
But we...we finally came around. We know th-this is something we have to do ourselves.${prompt};
We got lost along the way, though, and somehow ended up in the Sih Gates.${prompt};
A-and then we saw it. The ghost!${prompt};
Aaaaaaaaah!${prompt};
Quit pussyfooting around. There's no rrreason to be afraid.${prompt};
Listen good. At night, ghosts appear. So what? It comes with the territory.${prompt};
But this one isn't like a normal ghost! No one has ever seen one like it before!${prompt};
Ugh...fine. If you're that worried about it, I'll go over there and take a look.${prompt};
And you--I want you along for the rrride.${prompt};
And ${name-player}--I want you to come along for the rrride.${prompt};
So? Where did you see it?${prompt};
Th-the road leading to the Cirdas Caverns. Going by the map, it's...${prompt};
Who needs a map? You're coming with me!${prompt};
Though the wall appears to be completely enveloped in tree roots, excavation equipment might reveal something beneath it.${prompt};
Upending some of the soil reveals a weathered pouch made of leather. Judging by the location, it could only come from a pioneer who lost his life long ago.${prompt};
A brass-embossed envelope rests within the pouch, which in turn contains a crumpled sheet of vellum.${prompt};
How could those infernal forces have gotten so far back? Damn it, where's August!?${prompt};
Wh-what in the...;
By Altana, I can't see two fulms in front of me!${prompt};
A-a wall of light? Is this the Goddess herself come to mock me?${prompt};
Wait!;
That's where Jorius was dispatched!${prompt};
Wh-what in blazes!?${prompt};
The light...the light is completely disintegrating them!${prompt};
I'll say, Jorius! None will ever again doubt your strength.${prompt};
There's not a bone or stinking chunk of pustulous flesh for malms!${prompt};
And I'll be damned--you sent the Velkk scurrying back with their tails between their legs.${prompt};
You've saved us. No, you've saved the entire city.${prompt};
And August's wife and children--they're unharmed.${prompt};
C'mon. It's high time we take a breather.${prompt};
Yo, Jorius! It's safe to come back! They're all gone!${prompt};

Just beyond here lies Western Adoulin, the city where fortunes are made and lost. The efforts put into colonization have taken their toll on pioneers, and that area of the city serves as a place of respite for the weary.${prompt};
My heartaru goes out to all you pioneers. As if the dangers of the jungle weren't enough, you've also got to contend with the foul beasts within. It's a position I certainly do not envy-wenvy.${prompt};
A warm smile and a pataru on the back is all I am able to provide, but Elmric at the south side of tent-went may be able to give you more.${prompt};
This frontier station in the Ceizak Battlegrounds serves to accommodate the needs of pioneers. Is there something I can help you with today?${prompt};

Something's not quite right. Head to ${zone: 0[2]}, where Arciela awaits you.${prompt};
A strange force fills your soul.;
You begin to glow with an inner warmth!;
You there!;
If you value your life, don't you dare step another foot towards the jungle!${prompt};
This damsel must have been summoned by the spirits of the forest.${prompt};
Oh, ${name-player}.;
How coincidental that we should meet under such unsavory circumstances.${prompt};
Haha. By “summoned by the spirits of the forest,” I meant exactly as I said.${prompt};
You can take my words at their face value.;
To elaborate, I mean this current episode mimics one that occurred many years past.${prompt};
As to what the forest might want with her...my memories offer not even the slightest hint.${prompt};
What I do know is that this maiden will continue to heed the hinterland's call if we pretend this is only an isolated incident.${prompt};
She may even venture into the dark heart of the jungle, for there is no possible way we can keep watch over her at all times.${prompt};
If only the forest were not so dangerous...;
Maybe then she could feasibly meet with her mind's captor and plead for release from this ailment.${prompt};
Left to her own devices, however, I fear that it is more likely she would be praying for the sweet release of death from whatever savage beast stumbles upon her.${prompt};
If you wish to keep this girl from becoming a clump of bloody flesh hanging between jagged fangs, you will need to ascertain what it is that the spirits of the jungle want with her.${prompt};
Fortunately, you already know someone whose erudition regarding forest apparitions is nonpareil.${prompt};
Who do you know like that?;
${selection-lines};
Teodor.;
Arciela.;
No one.${prompt};
As much as I appreciate your flattery, I must say that you are incorrect. Think long and hard before answering again.${prompt};
${name-player}, I understand that as an adventurer you are constantly asked to make split-second decisions. This is not one of those times. You only make yourself look like a fool for doing such.${prompt};
Precisely.;
I am certain you were witness to it personally, but I have heard many a tale about how Arciela is able to commune with those who inhabit the jungle.${prompt};
The way I see it, ${name-player}, you are the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] for the job. You know the right people, and more importantly...${prompt};
Any adventurer worth his weight in bayld knows that saving damsels in distress is his Goddess-given duty!${prompt};
Any adventurer worth her weight in bayld knows that saving denizens in distress is her Goddess-given duty!${prompt};
${name-player} of the Middle Lands, do you have what it takes to uphold the tenets of your faith?${prompt};
Oho, what unbridled enthusiasm.;
Very well, I hereby entrust you with this most lofty of deeds. I would lend a hand myself, but I am afraid both of mine are tied with other affairs at the moment.${prompt};
Hey!;
Don't think that stealthy black outfit doubles as official permission to enter the woods. Get back here!${prompt};
Let the man-wan be, Elmric.${prompt};
He has his own brand of permission-wission. It would be bestaru if we didn't interfere.${prompt};
I doubt I shall ever understand how he manages to remain so expression-wessionless at all times.${prompt};
At any rate, he is a true oddity. An enigma tightly enclosed within a riddle, shrouded by a conundrum-wondrum. No wonder so much of the soldiers' idle chit-chataru revolves around him.${prompt};
Well, if there's no use chasing after that rebel, let's concentrate on protecting the girl...${prompt};
Hey, you! Pioneer!${prompt};
Yeah, I'm talking to you.;
We heard you blabbering with that black coat earlier.${prompt};
What was all that about? The girl's being summoned by spirits and you need to enlist Arciela's help or something? And how do you even know the princess?${prompt};
Ahhh, if my memory-wemory serves me, you are that adventurer from the Middle Lands.${prompt};
Hmph.;
What a surprise. I guess that means you'll be able to tell Arciela about this little incident?${prompt};
You deal with that, and we'll deal with getting the maiden home safe and sound.${prompt};
Huh?;
Why in all that's holy would you ask us where the princess is?${prompt};
You're the one who's all friendly with her. Wouldn't you know better than us?${prompt};
Why don't you try looking for her in places where you've met her before?;
Pretty basic advice, right? Well, if you ask a stupid question, you get a stupid answer.${prompt};
We've seen no change in the girl's condition. She remains unconscious.;
Were you able to meet with Arciela?${prompt};
What? Why do you keep asking me where she is!?;
I told you, if you want to meet her again, try looking where you've met her before!${prompt};
Oh, it's you...and Arciela!? Pardon me, Lady Adoulin, for not noticing you sooner.${prompt};
And here I thought that adventurer was just blowing smoke. Anyway, what brings you out here?${prompt};
Oh, the girl?;
She finally regained consciousness, so we escorted her back home.${prompt};
You escorted her home?;
${selection-lines};
Where's that?${prompt};
It's in Eastern Adoulin--some nondescript boarding house on the way to the statue of the Goddess. How about you let the princess do the talking, Middle Lander?${prompt};
Oh, I know whom you're talking about! That's Nyline, Pollimio's only daughter!${prompt};
We can't afford to let this chance pass us by. Let's head to their boarding house right now!${prompt};
So, her name's Nyline, huh?;
Hey, I thought I told you to stop talking to me!${prompt};
If you're really Arciela's friend, you'll get out of my face and over to that boarding house! It's near the statue of the Goddess, so hut-hut!${prompt};
Ugh, why did you of all people have to show your unseemly cratered face around me?${prompt};
What is more unsettling, though, is that a creature so base and primitive could possess such unbridled powers.${prompt};
Ingrid's shame and anger manifest themselves upon her countenance unchecked.${prompt};
Have anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
What happened?;
Why are you here?${prompt};
A tiger happened, that is what.;
A gargantuan feline with fur as fetidly aureate as gil dropped in a gutter carried her off in its slobbering jaws.${prompt};
The thing towered three full persons above us. Never have I seen a grotesquery of such cloud-cleaving proportions.${prompt};
Not only that, but its deafening roar shook every tree and stone in sight.${prompt};
A single glance into its beady eyes was all I needed to know that this monstrosity would shred Adoulin's entire populace to bits to satisfy its uncanny thirst for blood.${prompt};
I swear on my life that I could see those ferocious teeth puncture the princess's fair skin as it whisked her into the jungle, and it was all I could do to stay conscious when I caught wind of its breath. The odor could only be described as the mephitic stench of death.${prompt};
The stupidity of your question causes my head to throb with pain. What else could we be doing besides searching for the princess?${prompt};
It is only elementary that we expend our utmost efforts to return the Order of Adoulin's most beloved personage to her homestead if she goes missing. I suppose even that concept proves convoluted to someone who knows only how to spill blood rather than preserve it.${prompt};
Of course, another exorcism--oh, sorry, riffraff like you probably call them “spook-'em-outs” or something equally idiotic--is necessary, but just when we thought we had found her...${prompt};
Well, this is what happens when your opponent is too craven to face you head-on. I do not truly expect a savage beast to understand the concept of honor, but deception and trickery are the only tactics which he may employ to best someone of my caliber.${prompt};
The injustice of it all makes even my visceral organs boil with rage. We were ilms away from bringing her home...${prompt};
Brooding about it, however, will accomplish nothing.${prompt};
I would like nothing more than to go barreling into the depths of the forest and rescue our maiden in distress, but such stratagems befit no one but dim-witted adventurers who have heard one too many heroic ballads.${prompt};
An organized search party suits this situation best, not a misdirected band of vigilantes.${prompt};
Feel free to play your little game of Sword and Spell all you want, but we competent adults will return to Castle Adoulin to devise a fully thought-out plan.${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Quit.;

Is it true that you've found a cure for my brother's illness?${prompt};
Of course, my princess.;
The answers you seek lie deep within the forest. Allow me to “take a stab” at escorting you there.${prompt};
...Where are you taking me, Ingrid?${prompt};
You shall see.${prompt};
What're you doing!?${prompt};
This is nothing personal, Arciela. It is only that your archaically conservative attitudes about expansion are starving Adoulin of its future.${prompt};
If only you were less of a sniveling waif that kowtows to every sprite in the forest, colonization could have gone on unabated...${prompt};
...and his ideal world would have been realized!${prompt};
Eeeeeeeeeeeek!;
...Uhng...!;
...W-wait...;
Is this light...from the World Tree?${prompt};
We passed over it as we fled, and its power is made manifest.${prompt};
These golden shimmers will bring new life unto this weary land.${prompt};
New life...${prompt};
Rosulatia's pulled through for us. We owe her'n those other two a huge debt.${prompt};
That we do.${prompt};
Princess, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Ya sure pulled through when we needed ya.${prompt};
I'm just sorry I couldn't be standing by yer side.${prompt};
No, Morimar. What you did was more than enough.${prompt};
The rest've ya were the real stars. The iron fist of Hades is gone at last, and those of us who've seen it from start ta finish know more than any how much this means.${prompt};
Thank you.${prompt};
'Course, don't go expecting things ta be all smiles and rainbows. The tough part's still ahead.${prompt};
It's time ta head back.${prompt};
Sure is!${prompt};
The city is waiting for us!${prompt};
There you are!${prompt};
You and Morimar just snuck off like children escaping from a sermon!${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
I'm glad you made your peace.;
Speaking of Morimar, where is he?${prompt};
Stop trying to change the subject!${prompt};
Do you remember the promises we made? Not just in Leafallia, but in the castle?${prompt};
You said we'd stick through things together...and then you leave me...${prompt};
Hehe! Just a quick little jab to get you back.;
Of course, I was sad, but your being there at all meant a lot.${prompt};
Arcielaaaaaa!;
You can't just go running off like that! Grennith'll have my head!;
<Huff puff>${prompt};
(Stupid Fremilla!)${prompt};
(Maybe you should've kept up!)${prompt};
(Yeah! Fly around like us!)${prompt};
“Stupid Fremilla”!? I didn't run all the way out here just to--${prompt};
(Stop being such a baby!)${prompt};
(Yeah, quit whining!)${prompt};
(After all, we're the best of friends now!)${prompt};
Eeeeeep! My head is pounding because of you bouncy buggers!;
They've taken a real liking to Fremilla. Ever since the orders and I made up, they've been fluttering around her day and night.${prompt};
To be honest, I'm a bit jealous.${prompt};
Inquire about whom?;
${selection-lines};
Fremilla.;
The heartwings.;
Ygnas.${prompt};
I was so happy when she finally woke up.${prompt};
She had it tougher than the rest, what with being possessed by Balamor...${prompt};
...But now she's the perfect picture of health and energy.${prompt};
I made her my personal attendant.${prompt};
“Why?”${prompt};
I asked her. You were at the castle--everything is happening so fast.${prompt};
I know she can be a bit daft at times, but at the same time her hard work and dedication inspire me to reach for greater heights.${prompt};
I've brought her with me to the jungle to help get her in tip-top shape.${prompt};
At least that's what I've told her.♪${prompt};
Ygnas helped them to see that none of us meant any harm.${prompt};
But you've experienced how temperamental they can be.${prompt};
Eventually, though, we got through to them.${prompt};
(Don't think we've totally forgiven you!)${prompt};
(Yeah! 'Cause we haven't!)${prompt};
I suppose not!${prompt};
Aaaaaaaaah!${prompt};
(She's done it again!)${prompt};
(And to the rescue we go!)${prompt};
Though a bit childlike, they connect the forest to humanity, and I fully intend to make sure our relationship is always positive and fruitful.${prompt};
Hehe, I thought you would ask about him.${prompt};
You may have guessed, but that little leafkin is my brother.${prompt};
The curse of the founder king has been lifted, and Ygnas is back to normal.${prompt};
Maybe it's because he was a leafkin for so long, but now he's able to switch back and forth at will.${prompt};
I would have given anything to capture the look on Grennith's face when she saw him poof out in a bundle of leaves.${prompt};
He's given me so much wonderful advice, and it seems he prefers that form more than his human one...but I'm not completely sure how I feel about it.${prompt};
Phew...${prompt};
My days and nights are filled with matters of state, and time vanishes like smoke upon the wind.${prompt};
Sometimes I wonder if we'll even have much time to talk anymore, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Up until just a little while ago we stood together, shoulder to shoulder...but now, the city is at peace.${prompt};
Don't get me wrong--I don't begrudge it a minute. But no victory is accomplished without a price.${prompt};
Colonization continues, and Adoulin remains in need of pioneers...especially men and women like you.${prompt};
Remember how I referred to you as a wind?${prompt};
If you try to seal wind away, it quickly turns to ordinary air. For it to continue blowing, it needs to be able to travel the world.${prompt};
I want you to continue blowing at the backs of those who need a little push forward...${prompt};
...and bring positive change to them in the same way you did to me and my city.${prompt};
And because of that, I know it would be wrong to tie you here.${prompt};
But no matter where your travels take you, I hope that you'll return to us from time to time, lending a hand where it's most needed.${prompt};
It'd be no greater honor than to...${prompt};
Ah! I almost forgot something!${prompt};
I was speaking with Ingrid a little while ago...${prompt};
...And she mentioned you have a little something to return to me.${prompt};
Do you have anything to return to her?;
${selection-lines};
No?;
You mean your bonnet?${prompt};
I dropped something when Darrcuiln saved me here in the battlegrounds.${prompt};
Do you know where it is?${prompt};
No...${prompt};
Take a good look at me. Isn't something missing?${prompt};
<Sigh>${prompt};
Are you absolutely sure?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Stop playing around! I know you have my bonnet! The one that I'm always wearing!${prompt};
Fine! If you want it so bad, I'll give you one of my spares, but give me the one you've got!${prompt};
Yes, that's the one!${prompt};
I'm so glad it didn't get lost!${prompt};
I've got a couple similar ones, but this is my absolute favorite. When I came to in Kamihr, I immediately noticed that it was gone.${prompt};
I was actually pretty depressed. You see, my mother made this for me.${prompt};
Thank you for taking such good care of it.${prompt};
Ok! Let's do this!${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
What are we doing?;
Huh?${prompt};
Surely you didn't think I'd be sitting behind a desk shuffling papers all day!;
If I'm going to lead, I'll do it my way--by setting an example of harmony between my people and the jungle.${prompt};
<Huff> <puff>...${prompt};
Huh? Where did she...;
Princess? Arciela!?${prompt};
Over here, Fremilla!${prompt};
Wha--;
Princess!${prompt};
You'll have to keep up! I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.${prompt};
${name-player}, don't forget about me!${prompt};
W-wait!;
Gyaaaaaah!;
Heavens! You can't just leave me behind--!;
Many volumes have been penned in Adoulin's history.${unknown: 0x7F38B400};
One strange story, written far, far, in the future, goes like this...${unknown: 0x7F38B400};
A nation once ruled by a council of twelve was united;
once more under the hand of a benevolent queen.${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
And that land would leave an indelible mark on history.${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
Change did not come all at once, but each passing;
year turned more prosperous than the last.${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
The queen's sword shone brightly in the daytime sky...${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
...As she strode through castle and canopy with a;
golden tiger and tiny leafkin by her side.${unknown: 0x7F386801};
Nothing happens.${prompt};
Teleportation protocols active. Proceed?;
${selection-lines};
No.;
Beam me up.${prompt};
${name-player}!;
Did you come all this way just to see me?${prompt};
Are you here to see her?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
It's just a coincidence.${prompt};
Oh...I see. I understand if you have other things to do.${prompt};
Hee hee! I'm happy to hear you say that--even if it's a little fib.${prompt};
You know, ${name-player}, I've been feeling a little down lately. I can't help but think about my father.${prompt};
I can't help but think back to that conversation we had with Estienneux. Remember?${prompt};
My father brought a small contingent into the jungle, never to return again.${prompt};
Everyone thinks I always snuck out to the forest because I wanted to learn more about it...but they were only half right.${prompt};
I also hoped to find anything of my father's. A ring, a torn piece of cloth...anything.${prompt};
But I couldn't find so much as a trace. They had vanished as if whisked away by some spell.${prompt};
Now that the mood in Adoulin proper has begun to settle, I've asked Morimar to help me look--but he, too, thinks their disappearance was completely out of the ordinary.${prompt};
His many years of patrolling the depths of Eastern Ulbuka gives him a certain insight the rest of us lack. It's that insight I'm depending on.${prompt};
In fact, he should be back from his rounds any minute. Will you stay with me until he returns?${prompt};
My father was a strong leader, but he caused his advisors no end of consternation.${prompt};
He was prone to speak in riddles and take erratic actions. Oh, ${name-player}, if you could see the look on his aide Fusilton's face...${prompt};
What's that now? The apple doesn't fall far from the tree?${prompt};
Now that you mention it...I suppose it doesn't!${prompt};
He was a good, kind man.${prompt};
One evening, he took Ygnas and me aside and expounded on what it meant to be a leader.${prompt};
“The right to guide others is always accompanied by obligation and responsibility. One who leads people to success must always be aware of what this means and remain ever on the side of justice.${prompt};
“But this does not mean that a leader must remain cast in the same mold all throughout his life. He must learn from those who came before him without being beholden to their ways of thinking and acting.${prompt};
“Living in the times we do requires taking a different, more critical stance. We have the duty to look beyond our country and critically examine what is important for Vana'diel as a whole.”${prompt};
...I looked up to him. We all did.${prompt};
But I suppose when we first met, you had no idea that I was of noble birth, right?${prompt};
My father made me what I am today. I've no delusions otherwise.${prompt};
I wish...I wish he could see me today, and that he would be proud of me.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
He's proud of you. Everyone is.;
You'll see him again. I know it.;
Just say focused on the city.${prompt};
I hope so. I feel everyone's gaze upon me with every step I take...especially yours.${prompt};
You're right. A goodbye is never permanent.${prompt};
Ooof...you got me good with that one!${prompt};
Thank you for being frank with me. You've always been my rock.${prompt};
What on--!;
Don't worry, Arciela. I'll make sure to keep ${name-player} safe.${prompt};
Is this...is this the Trust magic that has become popular in the Middle Lands?${prompt};
A particularly vibrant Tarutaru visited the castle from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies about a fortnight ago, and he explained to Ygnas and me how strong bonds can bring about a magic unlike any other.${prompt};
Then I suppose our friendship is even closer than I had thought.${prompt};
Let me tell ya, Princess, when ya search fer ages and find nothin' you start to lose confidence in yerself.${prompt};
Oho, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
Arciela musta told you the whole story, yeah?${prompt};
I've lost count of how long I've lived here in the wilds.${prompt};
And if anyone knows about the oddities that've happened these five years, it'd be me.${prompt};
But an entire troop vanishin' inta thin air...it's just unnatural.${prompt};
I'm about ready ta throw my hands up. Whatever happened, it wasn't because of the jungle.${prompt};
Someone--something--just threw 'em off into another dimension. That's the only explanation.${prompt};
You can't possibly mean...Tartarus?${prompt};
I doubt it.${prompt};
I remember reading about something like that in the Middle Lands, when a unit mysteriously disappeared during the Great War. You'd be surprised what volumes are available in Celennia Memorial Library.${prompt};
Perhaps it could be related?${prompt};
Sometimes ya hear 'bout things like that, but just 'cause somethin' happened o'er there doesn't mean it's the same here.${prompt};
Maybe not...;
Thank you for checking, Morimar. Let's turn in for the day.${prompt};
Whatever ya say, Princess. And don't worry--if I find somethin', you'll be the first ta know.${prompt};
Great!${prompt};
${name-player}, thank you for keeping me company. Hopefully my alter ego can accompany you when I cannot.${prompt};
You know, I'm reminded of something.${prompt};
My father once carried a blade of pure mythril with seven stars inscribed upon the hilt.${prompt};
Wherever he is now, I hope he still bears it by his side.${prompt};
Listen to me, rambling on about maybes and hopefullys.${prompt};
Stay safe, ${name-player}. Be sure to visit me at the castle sometime.${prompt};
Oho! Look who we have here!;
Ah, I suppose you expected me to exit, stage left?${prompt};
Yet I stand before you, as full of vim and vigor as always.${prompt};
I myself could not have written a more fabulous reunion.${prompt};
Tut-tut. Before you attempt to lay waste to me once more, shouldn't you at least offer words of congratulation at my surviving?${prompt};
Hm? Her?${prompt};
Oh, no, I have nothing to do with her being in this piteous state. Cross my heart and hope to die!♪${prompt};
I arrived here, and there she was, sprawled on the ground like a discarded prop. Come to think of it, I do seem to recall seeing her before...${prompt};
I just wanted to ask her if she intended to try out for a main role on this Ulbukan stage, or if she would rather play a bit part.${prompt};
Oh, no need to thank me. I've never had a flair for the restorative.${prompt};
Master...;
I met him...the ambassador.${prompt};
I confronted him, trying to force him...to purge the darkness within you.${prompt};
B-but...I couldn't...;
He escaped...;
F-forgive me.${prompt};
Come, come. What did you expect?${prompt};
Ah, and perhaps you realized already...${prompt};
That masked you sure is something else. That apple fell pretty far from the tree, hmmm?${prompt};
What horrible thing happened to turn you astray? Betrayal? Despair? Malediction? Voodoo?${prompt};
Urk...;
Your little friend here seems ready to kick the bucket.${prompt};
Not like I can do much to help her, but I'll be more than pleased to watch over her until her inevitable demise.${prompt};
Perhaps a little mood lighting would be in order? Maybe some dramatic music?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
What happened?;
Iroha, I...I love you!;
Don't leave!${prompt};
I tried to apprehend the ambassador...that masked man...${prompt};
<Gurgle>...${prompt};
M-master...How could you joke at a time like...;
<Gurgle>...${prompt};
Oh, don't stop now! I do love a good Romeo and Juliet knock-off!${prompt};
M-master...fret not...;
We will be together...before long.${prompt};
I must tell you something before...before...${prompt};
The ambassador said...;
“When the orb is filled with light...the Reckoning will be at hand.”${prompt};
That can only mean...that he came into existence...when the Reckoning occurred.${prompt};
I had hoped...to be there with you...until the very end.${prompt};
Master...in my future, you left...leaving me behind.${prompt};
The crystal's reverberations...Selh'teus's voice...;
Eventually they all left me.${prompt};
All I could do was wait for the end...;
...For the cloud to engulf me.${prompt};
But the world stood frozen in time...with nary a sunrise nor sunset.${prompt};
And then a divine voice...called out to me.${prompt};
Reisenjima was the only place left on Vana'diel...and countless worlds had succumbed to the darkness...${prompt};
“You must reverse the Reckoning...”${prompt};
“You must reverse the Reckoning, even at the cost of Vana'diel herself...”${prompt};
And so I reached out to the light...and it brought me here.${prompt};
You must make many journeys...;
Learn many things...;
Meet many people...${prompt};
The orb...you must...${prompt};
Well, that's a new one! I expected a corpse, and here we are with your lovely little friend vanishing into thin air.${prompt};
But I'll give her this--for a Hume, she's got some spunk.${prompt};
And her musings--did she skip to the end of the script without reading the middle?${prompt};
So this “Emptiness” eats up her world and she time-warps her way back to us.${prompt};
Maybe I shouldn't be one to talk, but doesn't that strike you as a touch unfair?${prompt};
And you've got quite the curious role in this whole affair, too. Different than her, mind you, but amusing nonetheless. Though I suppose that's a mystery best left for later.${prompt};
I'd love to just dig into that little skull of hers to find out what makes her tick.${prompt};
At any rate, whatever powers she's got sure didn't stop her from expiring.${prompt};
And that leaves it to you to carry out her last will and testament. Could you imagine the tears rolling down those cheeks if she came back and you were off playing Boom or Bust over in Adoulin?${prompt};
Not that I'd put it past you.${prompt};
And let's be frank--the two of you have been nothing but thorns in my side ever since I tried to suck the life out of Tartarus and who-knows-how-many other worlds.${prompt};
And of course, I would be remiss to let such a tale of ${choice: 0}[friendship/love] end in anything other than pure, unadulterated tragedy!${prompt};
...Aaand so I have a little gift for you.${prompt};
Your precious little orb? I'll take just an inkling of its juices as a surcharge.;
Now, tell me if that doesn't rest a bit lighter in your pockets. And as an extra parting gift, I'll leave you with your memories of the dearly departed. Don't say ol' Balamor never gave you anything!;
Bwehehehe!;
Hm? Are you still trying your hand at playing detective?${prompt};
I see... So Fremilla is the one doing the investigating this time around.${prompt};
It must've been quite the sight to see her racing out of the castle... She refuses to be tied down by convention, although I suppose I'm not one to talk.${prompt};
That being said, I imagine she's so focused on helping Arciela that she's probably just moving blindly about without any real direction.${prompt};
Although, the day will eventually come when Arciela and Adoulin itself require her support. I look forward to seeing that day in person.${prompt};
In fact, that day might come even sooner than anticipated...${prompt};
It truly is strange...${prompt};
At first, I was able to use the power of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to speak only a few rudimentary sentences.${prompt};
But now, I'm actually quite fluent.${prompt};
Although it's coming along slowly, I've been able to hold conversations with the townsfolk recently.${prompt};
And I'm only able to take that next step because peace has been restored to Adoulin.${prompt};
In other words, ${name-player}, I have you to thank.${prompt};
It's long overdue, but I want to express my gratitude.${prompt};
Normally, this would be where I tell you to let me know if you ever need my help...${prompt};
However, there is still much that requires my attention. I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance to you.${prompt};
What!?;
Maybe there is a way I could help you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Is that the Trust magic I've been hearing about?${prompt};
Arciela's told me about it, but I've never actually seen it in person...${prompt};
This really is amazing! The leaves are so lifelike... It's like an exact duplicate of me!${prompt};
This is proof of the connection between our hearts and minds, ${name-player}... This shows just how strong the bond between us is!${prompt};
Y-Ygnas!;
I-I... I finally--found you.;
Hah... It's tough... Not used to this--body... Hard to speak...${prompt};
Huh!? What's going on here!? There are two of you, Ygnas!?${prompt};
Ahh... I get it. One of you must be Geosuke...;
H-huh!? He disappeared! What's going on here, Ygnas? Or are you Geosuke? I-I'm so confused!${prompt};
That was what is known as an Alter Ego.${prompt};
An Alter-whatsit? What on Vana'diel is that!?${prompt};
I don't know about Fremilla.${prompt};
I don't know about Alter Egos.${prompt};
I don't know about anything.${prompt};
I-It's them! Here they come again!;
Hah... I don't think Fremilla's in any position to be saving Adoulin just yet...${prompt};
Alright then! I suppose it's time for me to get to work!;
Hah... Hah... How did it all come to this?${prompt};
Wait... Huh? Ygnas!? He's disappeared again!${prompt};
Fremilla! Look after Arciela for me!${prompt};
Huh!?;
Ygnas!${prompt};
I'm a bit worried about something. I need to go on ahead for a while.${prompt};
I leave the rest to you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Hey! We can't let him get away!;
Kyyyaaaaaaahhhh!;
Hey! We let him get away!;
The following is an excerpt from the biography of a certain individual...${unknown: 0x7F38B400};
In the distant future...${unknown: 0x7F38B400};
The allied nation was drawn together under the rule of a single queen...${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
It expanded in both size and splendor, and its name and queen would be known throughout the land.${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
Although it would take some time for their fame to reach such heights...${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
The young queen sauntered forth with her jeweled sword hanging from her hip...${unknown: 0x7F38F000};
And her many great deeds performed were actually the work of a small tree-like spirit...${unknown: 0x7F386801};
