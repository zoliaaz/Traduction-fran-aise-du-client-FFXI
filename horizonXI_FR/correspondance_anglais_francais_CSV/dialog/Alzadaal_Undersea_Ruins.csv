This is an ancient ruin you have the privilege to be in. Try not to disturb the--${prompt};
This is my first time in an ancient ruin! It's so exciting!${prompt};
Poor old Tateeya is stuck in the factory all by herself!;
But lucky me gets to go on a field trip with Mister Ghatsad!${prompt};
Well, I'm glad to see you're taking an interest in the past.${prompt};
But if you keep up that ruckus, who knows what sort of unwanted attention you'll attract?${prompt};
Even with us here to protect you, some monster might snatch you away into the shadows.${prompt};
They've even employed mercenaries from Salaheem's Sentinels to patrol the ruins for dangerous beasts.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Many alchemists have fallen prey to the legions of foul creatures that stalk these halls.${prompt};
You know how on moonless nights you can hear the roar of the Cyan Deep echoing through the darkness?${prompt};
That sound is really the wails of those lost alchemists as their spirits roam the ruins in despair...${prompt};
Rishfee!${prompt};
That's quite enough. The poor child is shaking in fear.${prompt};
Is that r-really true?${prompt};
Maybe you'll be the first to find out...${prompt};
Y-you're lying!;
You're just being a big meanie-weanie!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Amnaf. What do you see?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Quiet...${prompt};
We're not alone...${prompt};
Oh?${prompt};
Hey, it's you!;
What are you doing down here?${prompt};
If you want to see the ruins, you should come along with us!${prompt};
Ah, yes. Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} marks you plainly.${prompt};
Are you taking care of your automaton?${prompt};
Are you here all by yourself?${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
I'm assuming this is your first visit to the ruins?;
Perhaps it would benefit you to join our little tour.${prompt};
Mister Ghatsad was about to tell us about the Alzadaal civilization.;
These ruins have so many stories!${prompt};
Which part of the ruins do you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
The windows.;
The pillars.;
The floor.${prompt};
You wish to learn about the windows?${prompt};
Look at those fish swimming around in there!;
I wonder what would happen if the windows broke!${prompt};
Those fish are actually swimming in the waters of the Cyan Deep. We are currently on the bottom of the ocean, looking out at them.${prompt};
Those windows are under an incredible amount of pressure from the weight of the water. If the windows were to break, I'm afraid we'd be crushed in an instant.${prompt};
What is that sparkling light all over the glass?;
I've never seen anything like it!${prompt};
That is the glow of plasma oil...${prompt};
Ooh, isn't that the same oil we use in the automatons?${prompt};
That's correct.;
The windows of these ruins are actually membranes of plasma oil that repel the waters of the sea like giant bubbles.${prompt};
You mean it just bounces off?${prompt};
You could put it that way, yes.;
But these barriers have been in place for hundreds of years. I highly doubt they'll give way any time soon.${prompt};
A truly astonishing feat of technology.${prompt};
However, the only reason these membranes hold is due to a constant supply of plasma oil.${prompt};
Some day, this supply must run out, and when it does...${prompt};
Are y-you trying to scare me too, Mister Ghatsad?;
I'm not sure I wanna stay here much longer...${prompt};
Ah, you've touched upon an interesting area.${prompt};
But it is not the shape of the pillars that is so fascinating.${prompt};
Any person with a basic knowledge of archaeology would recognize the graceful conical base and frail-looking central column.${prompt};
This design was often seen in the temples built during the reign of Emperor Alzadaal, some 900 years ago.${prompt};
The fascinating thing about these pillars lies in the construction itself.${prompt};
There are markings that suggest a degree of rotation and elongation is possible...${prompt};
Why would they make a pillar like that?${prompt};
Hmm, I wonder the same thing.${prompt};
I theorize that the architects of this structure wanted to incorporate a level of flexibility to compensate for the changes in water pressure...${prompt};
That's pretty clever...${prompt};
Should these technological marvels be understood in the near future, I hope to adapt their use to the field of automaton construction...${prompt};
Mister Ghatsad!${prompt};
I'm gonna work real hard on my studies so I can help you!${prompt};
The floor?;
Yes, it really is quite fascinating.${prompt};
Ooh, I wanted to hear about this!${prompt};
The elegant mosaics on the floor are designed with several different varieties of stones... One might say that these designs are symbolic of the prosperity of the Alzadaal Dynasty.${prompt};
It's a shame we've lost so many of the arts of that age...${prompt};
What about this shining symbol on the floor over here?${prompt};
I'm sure I've seen this design somewhere before...${prompt};
Hmmm....${prompt};
Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum...${prompt};
That is a transport device not unlike the runic portals currently employed by the Empire.${prompt};
The Aht Urhgan Archaeological Research Institute has deemed these devices safe for use in their continuing investigations.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum...;
So they still work even after 900 years?${prompt};
Yes.;
A curious fact.${prompt};
The A.A.R.I. has been diligent in its efforts to remove all traces of dust and grime as they work through the ruins, but have not attempted any maintenance.${prompt};
There simply hasn't been a need.${prompt};
It's as if these ruins have been frozen in time...${prompt};
Not merely in appearance, but in all of its functions.${prompt};
I love mysteries!${prompt};
I bet the ruins were just waiting for us to rediscover them!${prompt};
You could be right, Abda-Lurabda...${prompt};
I think that's enough for one day.;
Time to return to the workshop.${prompt};
What? Already?;
We just got here!${prompt};
We can't have poor Tateeya mind the place all by herself, now can we?${prompt};
I suppose not...;
But you'll bring me here again, right?${prompt};
I promise.${prompt};
Rishfee, would you mind escorting young Abda-Lurabda back to Al Zahbi?${prompt};
Aren't you coming with me?${prompt};
Not just yet. I have some things to discuss with this mercenary...${prompt};
Well, okay.;
See you later!${prompt};
I suppose you're wondering why I asked you to stay.${prompt};
As you can see, I am also an alchemist affiliated with the Aht Urhgan Archaeological Research Institute.${prompt};
I often have cause to visit the ruins in this manner.${prompt};
Have you figured out what the A.A.R.I.'s true purpose is here in the ruins?${prompt};
The conservation of cultural heritage?${prompt};
The research of ancient civilization?${prompt};
These are merely facades.${prompt};
The truth of the matter is, our organization is under orders from the Empress to locate the missing Astral Candescences.${prompt};
Yes.;
The candescence held in Al Zahbi is not the only one in existence.${prompt};
How much do you know about the Astral Candescence, ${name-player}?${prompt};
How much do you know?;
${selection-lines};
I'm an expert.;
Not so much.${prompt};
Well, it seems our nation's treasure is more famous than I expected.${prompt};
The Astral Candescence was originally brought into the city to halt the spread of the Bastokan Blight in the Empire.${prompt};
The emperor of the time hoped to ease the suffering of his people and his nation...${prompt};
The candescence blesses all with its energy, regardless of station or wealth. It became a symbol of salvation.${prompt};
It is ironic that the candescence is now the catalyst for a new conflict, as the beastmen hurl themselves against our defenses time and again in an effort to claim it.${prompt};
The Astral Candescence is a national treasure that is set upon the Astral Plinth within Al Zahbi's Hall of Binding.${prompt};
Known as the “Astral Wind,” the infinite energy of the astral plane flows from this treasure...${prompt};
...uplifting the Empire's citizens and granting them courage.;
It is the source of the Empire's prosperity.${prompt};
And yet the candescence is also the catalyst for unending conflict, as the beastmen hurl themselves against our defenses time and again in an effort to claim it.${prompt};
We receive the blessings of the candescence at the price of peace...${prompt};
But there is more than one candescence.;
There are few that are aware of this fact.${prompt};
Through the research of various ancient texts and relics, we have verified the existence of four other candescences.${prompt};
If we can but find these missing treasures, there may be a chance to end this futile conflict.${prompt};
That is the aim of the A.A.R.I.${prompt};
What do you say, ${name-player}?;
Will you aid us in our search?${prompt};
Hm?;
You wonder why I know your name?${prompt};
It is not so surprising.;
I was the one who sent the request to Salaheem's Sentinels asking you to patrol the ruins.${prompt};
It seems the Immortals stationed at the staging points have taken a liking to you.${prompt};
Your name was at the top of the list of candidates.${prompt};
${name-player}, if we can find these missing candescences...${prompt};
...Aht Urhgan, no, the entire Aradjiah Continent may know the paradise of peace once again.${prompt};
Ghatsad hands you an ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
That ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will lead you to a candescence.${prompt};
But, be warned.${prompt};
This device is not set to respond to faint astral waves. The Astral Wind that blows from the candescences reaches far across the land, even as it weakens in intensity.${prompt};
Picking up these waves would help little in pinpointing a location, and so you will only receive a response when you are close to the source.${prompt};
I'm sure you can see why your position as a mercenary with duties across the continent will prove invaluable.${prompt};
I ask that you carry the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with you at all times.${prompt};
Ah yes, the device has been constructed to ignore the emanations from the candescence in Al Zahbi.${prompt};
You have your mission. The future peace of the Near East is riding on your success.${prompt};
One more thing, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Do not reveal my position as the chief of the A.A.R.I.;
We should not even acknowledge each other on the street.${prompt};

Show me!;
Show me the will that allowed you to take my hand!;
The vessel changes shape to meet its needs. Call it evolution.${prompt};
But those who completely lose their mortal form are no better than monsters...${prompt};
How will you fare?;
Will you keep your mortal form until the end?;
Heh...${prompt};
No matter. You have faced the truth and taken the life of a colleague you never knew.${prompt};
Your actions do you credit.${prompt};
Now, perhaps, you will understand Raubahn...or should I say, Waoud?${prompt};
Now you may understand the meaning behind his questions...${prompt};
You have earned your reward.;
There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt};
Now is not the time for that!${prompt};
Nothing happens...${prompt};

Greetings, mercenary.;
I am ${name-npc} of the Immortals.${prompt};
You are here on an Assault mission?;
Then you'll be wanting command verification.${prompt};
Do you want command verification?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.;
I want to ask you some questions.${prompt};
What do you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Command verification.;
Nyzul Isle Assault missions.;
Nyzul Isle Uncharted Region.${prompt};
If you have ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[credit/credits] available from your Imperial Standing, I will recognize your ability to lead this Assault mission.${prompt};
Receive command verification?;
${selection-lines};
Yes. (${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[credit/credits]);
No.${prompt};
Very well.;
Consider your command of this mission verified.${prompt};
With this in your possession, you will be able to pass through the runic seal and enter the Assault area.;
Good luck.${prompt};
I cannot entrust leadership of a mission to a mercenary with such an unimpressive standing.;
Return to me when you are worthy.${prompt};
You refuse to assume leadership?;
Perhaps you should make that decision before you speak to me.${prompt};
No?;
Then I suggest you complete your preparations and await your leader's orders!${prompt};
Receiving command verification will authorize you to begin an Assault mission.${prompt};
You will also be responsible for confirming that all members are prepared to begin the mission.${prompt};
Shouldering this responsibility, and leading your party to victory are all part of being a truly outstanding mercenary.${prompt};
The Nyzul Isle remnants are divided into numerous separate floors.;
It it not possible to travel between these floors by normal means.${prompt};
The only way to pass from one floor to another is by using Nyzul “tokens” at a device known as the “Rune of Transfer.”${prompt};
You currently possess ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Nyzul token/Nyzul tokens], and can travel to any floor up to and including Floor ${number: 2}.${prompt};
The only way to pass from one floor to another is by using Nyzul “tokens” at a device known as the “Rune of Transfer.”${prompt};
You currently possess ${number: 1} Nyzul ${choice-plurality: 1}[token/tokens], and have explored as far as Floor ${number: 4}.${prompt};
This is the Nyzul Isle staging point.;
If you have no official business here, it's time for you to leave.${prompt};
Letting the San d'Orian spy live was the right move, it seems...${prompt};
It has all unfolded just as the Grand Vizier predicted.${prompt};
And so you have come...${prompt};
A pity.;
I always respected you, ${name-player}, but such are the twists of fate.${prompt};
The Grand Vizier has decreed that your time on this stage has come to an end.;
!?;
Hehehe.${prompt};
One, two, three...at ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} per...${prompt};
${name-player}!;
This level of assistance just cost ya ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!${prompt};
Naja! What is the meaning of this?${prompt};
That's what I'd like to know!${prompt};
This employee still has a pile of tuition fees to pay.;
If I let ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] come to a messy end here, I'm losin' out on a lot of cash!${prompt};
You worry for a few measly coins?;
If you stand against me, your entire company is at stake.${prompt};
Ooh, I'm shakin' in my booties.;
Need I rrremind ya that my company has the personal backing of the Emprrress?${prompt};
Times have changed, foolish Mithra...${prompt};
My help is expensive, ${name-player}.;
Better take care of this quickly if ya don't wanna spend the rrrest of your life payin' it off!${prompt};
For the Sentinels!!!;
${color-alt: 121}Proceeding with the Aht Urhgan mission “Path of Darkness” will prevent you from entering Salaheem's Sentinels until the mission is complete.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You can now proceed with the Aht Urhgan mission “Nashmeira's Plea.”${prompt};
Do you wish to proceed with the mission?${prompt};

Amnaf.;
My dear Immortal Lion.${prompt};
Your part in this is over.;
You have earned eternal rest...${prompt};
Ewww...;
Now this is an interrrestin' development.${prompt};
My tail is twitchin' all over the place...${prompt};
(Listen up, ${name-player}. We rrrun in different directions and meet up back at the office...)${prompt};
Now!;
${name-player}...one day I shall feast on your soul...${prompt};
One day...;
So, ${name-player}...;
This is the path you have chosen?${prompt};
Your decision has been noted...;
We have received an update from a patrol boat in the Gugru Blue.;
A force of close to fifty airships has been sighted advancing on Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
So...they have come.${prompt};
This would explain the appearance of the cluster of dots on the control panel display, wouldn't it, Ghatsad?${prompt};
Yes, Grand Vizier.;
They appear to be moving slowly, and keeping some distance from each other. They obviously fear the destructive power of the main cannon.${prompt};
Can we handle them all?${prompt};
We focused the energy of the cannon when destroying the previous target, but perhaps this time we should lure the enemy vessels as close as possible and then fire in a diffusion pattern. There's a good chance the entire fleet will be obliterated...${prompt};
In any case, we need to wait for the cannon to recharge.${prompt};
Very well.;
Let us await the arrival of this armada and provide Alexander with a fitting tribute.${prompt};
We have guests...;
You're just in time for the fireworks, Nashmeira.${prompt};
I came to speak with you, Razfahd.${prompt};
Speak with me...?;
I see you've brought your pet mercenary along for the “conversation.”${prompt};
${name-player} is here as my friend.${prompt};
As you wish.;
Now what is it you wish to discuss?${prompt};
I want you to stop using this automaton as a weapon of war.${prompt};
Hmph, I should have known...${prompt};
Nashmeira, you looked forward to the completion of the colossus as much as anyone.${prompt};
This is true...but that was before I learned more about your intentions from ${name-player} and Luzaf.${prompt};
If you use this machine to summon the spirit of Alexander, the world will be plunged into Ragnarok!${prompt};
In the space of a single night, the Empire will be reduced to a smoking ruin, just like the Alzadaal civilization before us...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ragnarok? You disappoint me, Nashmeira.;
The servants of the underworld have poisoned your mind.${prompt};
The might of Alexander will flood Urhguum with divine illumination, and bring about an eternal peace for the Empire.${prompt};
This will be the true Age of Judgment.;
Ragnarok was merely an example of how our ancestors failed.${prompt};
This time, there is nothing to fear.${prompt};
The astral candescences that form the heart of this colossus have been created using the latest Imperial technology. We will not repeat the mistakes of Alzadaal.${prompt};
Razfahd!;
Do you truly believe you can impose your will on a god!?${prompt};
And even if you could, the “peace” such a god would grant us is nothing more than a farce.${prompt};
Our nations are formed from a gathering of individuals.${prompt};
It's when these nations learn to cooperate and live in harmony that we learn the true value of peace.${prompt};
The gods bless us when they recognize the efforts we have made.${prompt};
Ever the idealist, Little Sister...${prompt};
Do you not see how our Empire is suffering?${prompt};
The authority we once wielded has all but evaporated.;
Our enemies constantly test our defenses, sniffing for the slightest hint of weakness like a tiger stalking a wounded marid...${prompt};
Our citizens stand on the brink of oblivion.${prompt};
And you must learn to accept certain sacrifices in exchange for their salvation.${prompt};
Please, Razfahd!;
I know that even ${name-player} here would be willing to speak on our behalf.${prompt};
We must try to negotiate with the Middle Lands once more!${prompt};
It is far too late for that.${prompt};
A fleet of airships from your precious Middle Lands approaches even as we speak.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
If we do nothing, Al Zahbi will be engulfed in a sea of flame...;
Who knows how many of our people will die?${prompt};
The cogs of war have begun to turn, and there is nothing either you or I can do to stop them.${prompt};
But we can--!${prompt};
Nashmeira.${prompt};
I am resolved to be remembered as the villain in this chapter of history. You need not let it concern you.${prompt};
But I will tolerate no further hindrances.${prompt};
Razfahd...!;
Listen to me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I have failed to persuade my brother to change his course.${prompt};
But we cannot allow this colossus to unleash another Divine Spear.${prompt};
(Can you see that control box that Ghatsad labors over? I have seen it before.)${prompt};
(It's much like one of the animators used to control a normal automaton.)${prompt};
(If we can somehow gain access to that box, we should be able to operate the colossus from the outside.)${prompt};
(All I need you to do is distract them for a moment!)${prompt};
What do you think you can do, mercenary?;
Your pitiful efforts will change nothing.;
Raubahn.${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, long have I awaited the chance to devour your essence.;
Do you recall what I told you about the purpose of the Empire?;
You have finally glimpsed the truth behind the curtain.${prompt};
And now you shall surrender your strength to me!;
Tremble...before me...;
Worship...my greatness...;
Tremble...;
Tremble...before...me...${prompt};
Has...has it stopped...?${prompt};
You don't tremble enough...!${prompt};
Ovjang!?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ovjang. Mnejing.;
Thank you...${prompt};
${name-player}!;
I did it!;
I took control of the colossus.;
I never could have done it without your distraction!;
Thank you, ${name-player}!;
Now we have to get my brother out of there...${prompt};
Aphmau!${prompt};
Luzaf!?${prompt};
You're okay!;
Thank Walahra...${prompt};
Look!;
We shut down the colossus!;
And Alexander is gone...${prompt};
There's no one left to fight.;
There's no need for Odin to take you over...${prompt};
Luzaf...you're finally free!;
Be careful, Aphmau!;
Odin yet lurks within me...;
Aphmau!!!${prompt};
Those...who fail to worship...will be judged...;
...;
Alexander!!!;
Ahahahahahaha!;
Excellent, my knight!;
Thy rage is most pleasing...${prompt};
Odin...;
Once again...the Age of Judgment...has come...;
Thy demise...shall be swift...${prompt};
Thy words ring empty!;
I shall shower the earth with the shards of thine iron shell.${prompt};
Is this the dawn of Ragnarok...!?${prompt};
XIII...;
XII...;
XI...;
Thou seek to unleash Divine Judgment?;
Then Gungnir shall pierce thine intent...${prompt};
VI...;
V...;
Aaagh!!!;

I...;
You mustn't do this...;
Nooo!!!;
Where am I...?${prompt};
(Nashmeira...)${prompt};
Razfahd...?${prompt};
Do not fear...${prompt};
I will not...allow...these deities...to destroy our beloved...Aht Urhgan...${prompt};
What are you talking about?;
Your voice is so weak, Razfahd...${prompt};
I wanted to see...your smiling face...one more time...${prompt};
Don't go!;
Farewell...Nashmeira...;
No...;
Don't leave me...!;
Razfahd...;
Razfahd!!!;
Raz...fahd...;
Nash...;
Why dost thou sheath thy blade?${prompt};
My knight...;
Dost thou defy...${prompt};
...thy lord and master...?;
Aphmau...${prompt};
There are yet many things for you to accomplish.${prompt};
I will not let you perish here...;
Great Odin, Lord of the Underworld!${prompt};
I have defied your will!${prompt};
And yet I live...${prompt};
Why?${prompt};
Why do you spare me?${prompt};
I relinquish this pseudo-life of mine to the girl, Aphmau...${prompt};
It is time I returned to serve you in the halls of Valhalla...${prompt};
Ugh...${prompt};
Aphmau?${prompt};
Luzaf?;
What happened to me...?${prompt};
Merciful Odin...${prompt};
There is more I would say to you.${prompt};
But my time here has drawn to an end...${prompt};
Luzaf!${prompt};
You have a future before you.;
And it is not your future alone...${prompt};
The citizens of the Empire and of Ephramad...;
You carry the burden of their hopes and dreams...${prompt};
Don't you leave me as well!;
I will follow you anywhere...${prompt};
You are surrounded by those who care for you.;
The people of Aht Urhgan...the highest general to the lowest footsoldier in your army...;
And, of course, your trusted mercenary, ${name-player}...${prompt};
You're right...;
I must be strong.;
I will be the Empress that Aht Urhgan needs!${prompt};
Ahahaha.;
Never lose that spirit, Aphmau.;
Ah, I see the ocean!;
It seems my next battlefield shall be the Sea of the Underworld.;
...${prompt};
${name-player}.${prompt};
We have neglected our duties for far too long...${prompt};
Aht Urhgan is waiting!${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.;
${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”;
${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”;
${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.;
${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
It...it's not possible...;
Alexander! Why do you not respond!?;
The control lever...;
Ghatsad! What is going on!?;
I...am...Alexander.;
Tremble...before me...;
Worship...my greatness...;
That voice...!;
It echoes within my skull!;
I don't understand it.;
The colossus is not responding to external commands.;
No...it cannot be...;
I shall ascend to the heavens...;
Razfahd!?;
Ghatsad! Out of the way!;
Ovjang. Mnejing.;
Lend me your strength...;

Cursed essences of creatures devoured...;

The grrreat gouts of blood are frrree of charge!${prompt};
Ninety-nine silver coins a pop! A bargain, I tell ya!${prompt};

Pray to whatever gods you serve.${prompt};
Behold the power of my eldritch gaze!${prompt};
I will carve the soul fresh from your bones.${prompt};
My flesh remembers the wounds of ten thousand blades.;
Come, cut me again...${prompt};
My skin remembers the fires of ten thousand spells.;
Come, burn me again...${prompt};
My belly remembers the punctures of ten thousand arrows.;
Come, shoot me again...${prompt};
Hehehe...;
Do you now understand what it is to fight a true Immortal?;
Realize your futility and embrace despair...${prompt};
Ugh...;
Has your god granted you the miracle you seek...?${prompt};
Incredible.;
Feel the infinite power of divine might!;
Alexander will lead Aht Urhgan to certain victory!${prompt};

Something draws near!${prompt};
${keyitem-article: 0[2]} begins to pulsate gently...${prompt};
Quite the accomplishment.;
Never would I have expected you to surpass Zahak.;
I must confess, your persistence has piqued my interest...;
Hmph, so be it. Let us see if you are truly worthy of what it is you seek.;
A trial by battle you have earned. Your judgment shall be levied by mine own hand!;
Such...such power. Rarely...have I witnessed...${prompt};
You must call upon the cemetery in Caedarva Mire whilst bearing your mythic weapon in hand.;
Seek out the powers that rest there...${prompt};
For within those hallowed grounds forever sleeps a great soul, the breaker of waves.;
In former times, mine own enemy, to be sure, yet one who commanded admiration and respect, even from myself.${prompt};
Just like him...you are.;
An indomitable spirit, unknowing of defeat or resignation.${prompt};
As appropriate a place as any for this passing of the torch to take place, I should think.${prompt};
This you must do. Otherwise, the prize you seek shall never fall within your grasp.;
Go now...;
The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.${prompt};
The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.${prompt};
You have lost sight of the monster and can no longer sense its presence.${prompt};
You have wandered too far from the monster and can no longer sense its presence.${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
You're late, late, late!${prompt};
We've been waiting so long our joints have started to rust!${prompt};
Our preparations are complete.;
We need only install the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, and we can proceed with the activation.${prompt};
How did you fare with Megomak?${prompt};
Yes, this will do.;
Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt};
We are ready, Your Highness.${prompt};
...Then let us begin.${prompt};
When the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is activated, you must resist the extradimensional intruder with all of your might.;
Even a weakened colossus in a strictly controlled environment will not go down easily.${prompt};
Still your heart and clear your mind, ${name-player}.;
Your humble retainer Gessho stands at your side, ever ready to lay down his life for yours...${prompt};
L-lay down whose life?;
I thoughtaru we were j-just along for “obser-wobservation”!${prompt};
<Sigh>... Can you not even show some spine at a time like this?${prompt};
Silence.;
It begins.${prompt};
Power, check. Spatial variance readings, stable.;
Activation in three...two...${prompt};
I...am...Alexander.;
Tremble...before me...;
Worship...my greatness...;
Those...who fail to worship...;
Shall be...judged...${prompt};
You did it! You truly did it!;
That's my number one mercenary!${prompt};
Impressive indeed.${prompt};
Deactivation successful.;
Spatial variance measured at 25 and dropping...;
10......5......${prompt};
...Zero.;
We've done it, Your Majesty.${prompt};
I see your martial skills have not diminished one bit, ${name-player}.;
It was an honor to fight by your side once more.${prompt};
What's this...?;
Your Majesty, I'm getting unidentified vital signs from within the colossus!;
It's... Could it be!?${prompt};
L...Lord Razfahd!?${prompt};
Brother!!! Brother, can you hear me?${prompt};
Unbelievable... He is breathing.;
Was he...alive all this time?${prompt};
Please compose yourself, Your Majesty.;
We must carry your brother to the palace at once.${prompt};
My apologies, ${name-player}.;
Come to the palace afterward, and we shall properly reward you for your efforts.${prompt};
What dedication! What speed!;
That's our ${name-player}.${prompt};
Our people need live in fear of the colossus no more.;
Thank you, ${name-player}. I knew you wouldn't fail us.${prompt};
We will make arrangements with President Naja upon our return to the palace.;
Rest assured that you shall be richly rewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
${name-player}. You are a true ally of the Empire, and a true friend.;
Until we meet again...be well.${prompt};
${name-player}, you have my thanks as well.;
Mind you, I know better than to promise that this will be the last time we call upon your services.${prompt};
Until we develop a means to seal the distortion permanently, we must remain ever vigilant against extradimensional threats.${prompt};
My team and I will redouble our efforts.;
Promise us that we can count on your strength should another crisis arise.${prompt};
Farewell, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Thank goodness you've arrived.${prompt};
This building--and those like it scattered throughout the land--are historic ruins of the great Alzadaal Dynasty, which flourished over 900 years ago.${prompt};
Only under the most special of circumstances are those not from our lands permitted entry.${prompt};
Lady Nashmeira, if I may be so bold...;
What is the gargantuan contraption behind you?${prompt};
We refer to it as the colossus, a grand device manufactured by the Empire that houses the prime avatar.${prompt};
To think that such a monstrosity...${prompt};
I'm afraid I cannot explain more at present, but this edifice is related to the prime avatar spoken of in Aht Urhganian legends.${prompt};
${name-player} and I would surely like to hear more about what exactly this prime avatar is.${prompt};
In simple terms...an iron giant.${prompt};
An iron giant!?${prompt};
Its name is Alexander--a being that commands the forces light.${prompt};
It's a being that rules over the forces of light...known as Alexander.${prompt};
Huh?;
How is--;
What on Vana'diel...${prompt};
Ah, Phoenix. Thy voice always grated on mine ears.${prompt};
Oho. But 'twould seem thou art even more cacophonous than usual. Perhaps because now there are two of thee.${prompt};
Ah, so one carrying thy blessing has alighted on this land from the future.${prompt};
I understand thy predicament.${prompt};
If thou dost deem her to be of great importance, then I shall honor thy request to give her form in this world once more.${prompt};
Lady Iroha!;
Master...;
Sir Tenzen...${prompt};
How do you react?;
${selection-lines};
Iroha! Are you...;
How do you feel?;
I thought you had been killed!${prompt};
Lady Iroha, your journey to the realm of the living has surely taken its toll. Permit me to explain in your stead.${prompt};
None understand better than I.${prompt};
Phoenix has become whole in the future, and its life force has brought Iroha back to us.${prompt};
Yet this is not the first time, and gods strike me if it is the last.${prompt};
She is stuck within the cycle of life, returning to Vana'diel each time she is struck down.${prompt};
Would that I were not endlessly reliant on my family to rescue me after each mishap...${prompt};
My blade once held power of a similar magnitude, so I am all too familiar with the particulars.${prompt};
Yet just as flame can cauterize a grievous wound, so too are Phoenix's blazing wings of life accompanied by indelible pain. Am I wrong?${prompt};
There is no need to put on a brave front. Though your body may have recovered, your spirit yet needs time to heal.${prompt};
There is naught else for me to do...${prompt};
That girl's presence in this world is forbidden, and is why death doth clamor to claim her at every opportunity.${prompt};
Forbidden...?${prompt};
Doubtless because she has not yet been born.${prompt};
Order must be obeyed, and all that would threaten it shall be expunged.${prompt};
Even Phoenix can only protect her for so long. Its breath draws ever fainter, its energies beginning to wane.${prompt};
I have done what I can, but whether she is long for this world is not something for me to decide.${prompt};
I care not what hardships I must overcome. Master must bring light to my future, and my calling is to guide ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] along the path.${prompt};
And thou wilt stop at naught to banish the Emptiness.${prompt};
"Yet the Emptiness bringeth absolute darkness; it is not the absence of light I shall face ${choice: 1}[in the end/when Ragnarok cometh].${prompt}";
The spirits of eld have surely felt the presence of such an abomination since time immemorial.${prompt};
It surpasses the power of the gods themselves, and shall descend upon Vana'diel ere long.${prompt};
And its underlings have already arrived in our time.${prompt};
Lord Alexander, they aimed to engage in a ritual with the Astral Candescence and use it to steal your power.${prompt};
Ah yes, I recall the Candescence.${prompt};
But thou art slightly mistaken. They were not after my light, but rather Odin's darkness.${prompt};
Of course, it is only via my form that they would be able to summon Odin.${prompt};
But that would call forth${choice: 0}[/ another] Ragnarok!${prompt};
I would relish such a test of wills.${prompt};
${choice: 0}[No!/You can't--!]${prompt};
Fear not, youngling. They scattered as chaff before the wind.${prompt};
What concerneth me now is whether they will attempt to clip Phoenix's wings again...${prompt};
...or whether they will search for their darkness elsewhere.${prompt};
Hold.${prompt};
My primary concern lies not with vanquishing the ambassador, but rather with ensuring Master is prepared for the time of reckoning.${prompt};
And that is why ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] needs to fill the orb with...${prompt};
<Cough> <Hack>${prompt};
L-Lady Iroha!${prompt};
You mustn't--you need rest!;
You mustn't--you need rest!;
She is about to fade once more.${prompt};
Dost thou wish for a way to save her?${prompt};
'Twould be but a small hope, but the only being that could convince Vana'diel to accept her in this time would be one born of Altana's tears.${prompt};
One of the newest guardians of this world--Cait Sith.${prompt};
Ask Phoenix for its aid...${prompt};
My health should be...the least...of your concerns...${prompt};
Master...leave me to my fate...and continue your journey.${prompt};
Shhh. You'll be in safe hands back at the palace.${prompt};
Shhh. You'll be in safe hands back at the palace.${prompt};
She is correct. We shall return to Aht Urhgan in the meantime, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}! ${prompt};
Odin...let me gather what little darkness you have left.${prompt};
I shall...be free...${prompt};
