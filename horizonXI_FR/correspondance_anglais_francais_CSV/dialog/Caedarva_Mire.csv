I am Nahshib, and this is the Dvucca Isle staging point.;
I will fulfill my duties to the Empress day or night, rain or shine!${prompt};
I take great pride in my work. What could be more honorable than protecting the Empire?;
What I'm really trying to say, though, is...${prompt};
If you don't have any business here, then leave before I chase you out!${prompt};
I am Nahshib, and this is the Dvucca Isle staging point.;
I will fulfill my duties to the Empress day or night, rain or shine!${prompt};

If you've got something to say, then spit it out!${prompt};
Show the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
I have nothing to say.${prompt};
You show the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Nahshib looks confused.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?;
Did you meet with Naja Salaheem?${prompt};
I heard from Daswil that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} can be used to earn recognition as an Immortal...${prompt};
I never imagined I would get my hands on one so early... I'm still a brand-new member, after all.${prompt};
Oh, yes. Let me thank you.${prompt};
I have some good news for you.${prompt};
Do you see that shining blue pedestal behind you?${prompt};
It's a transport device called a “runic portal.”${prompt};
Apparently, the great alchemists of Aht Urhgan created it. That kind of knowledge is completely beyond me.${prompt};
It doesn't really matter, though. All that matters is that it's extremely convenient. Why not give it a try?${prompt};
You'll be in for a surprise...;
Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the “Chamber of Passage” in Al Zahbi!${prompt};
Then, you'll be able to use the runic portal to freely travel to and from Al Zahbi.${prompt};
The next time you wish to return here to the Dvucca Isle staging point, you would do well to remember the runic portal.${prompt};
If you have no business here, then leave. This is the Imperial Army's territory.${prompt};
I am sure the runic portal will come in handy the next time you wish to return here to the Dvucca Isle staging point.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s mercenary badge flashes.;
The mark of the wildcat... I see you have joined the ranks of the Salaheem's Sentinels mercenaries.${prompt};
So, you and I are both new recruits...${prompt};
You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};
Your Imperial Standing has increased!${prompt};
I, Nareema, will carry out the Empress's orders through fire, ice, and storm!;
Oh...welcome to the Azouph Isle staging point.${prompt};
Wait! I do believe you're trespassing on Imperial property!${prompt};
Get out of here!${prompt};
I, Nareema, will carry out the Empress's orders through fire, ice, and storm!;
Oh...welcome to the Azouph Isle staging point.${prompt};
You got something you want to say to me?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Nareema's face lights up!${prompt};
Oh! ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! How did you get this?${prompt};
It's magnificent... Look how it gleams... This scent makes me feel so fresh and pure!${prompt};
This is such a precious item. Thank you so much!${prompt};
What can I give you to show you my gratitude?${prompt};
Oh, I know! I have some fantastic information for you.${prompt};
See the glowing blue device behind you?${prompt};
That's a “runic portal,” the pride of Aht Urhgan!${prompt};
Our brilliant alchemists created it themselves. It takes you apart and puts you back together in a faraway place!${prompt};
Scary, isn't it? I was scared at first, too. I mean, the entire contraption is simply beyond belief. It's hard to believe that such a thing could exist on Vana'diel!${prompt};
I really don't get it... How could your body be disassembled, and then each individual molecule meticulously reassembled in Al Zahbi's Chamber of Passage? Does that make sense to you?${prompt};
Well, it might be frightening, but once you've traveled to Al Zahbi once using the runic portal, you can use it to return here, too!${prompt};
So if you'd ever like to talk with me again, don't forget about it!${prompt};
I know better than that. Your face says it all!;
I've heard enough, though. Get out of here before I chase you out...${prompt};
If you ever want to return here, you can use the runic portal. At least, I think so...${prompt};
Is this the mark of the wildcat? So you're a mercenary now, are you?;
I hope that all the fighting doesn't change you...${prompt};
Long ago, I used to be an adventurer... I was so free back then. I don't want you to ever lose that youthful innocence.${prompt};
Press a button to continue.${prompt};

You can't be serio--hmm? What's this?${prompt};
The monster...isn't here?${prompt};
You...defeated it for me?${prompt};

Stop your useless chatter. Get that gil pouch now!${prompt};
M-my apologies! Right away!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss]!;
Thank you for your help. If this useless cur wasn't so slow, that monster would be feeding on Hume kebabi by now.${prompt};
Ulp...${prompt};
What?;
Have you found the gil pouch yet?${prompt};
You have a lot of nerve, fool. You were the one who claimed that dropping the pouch in the swamp would turn it to gold! If you had never spouted such nonsense, this never would have happened!${prompt};
...Weren't you the one who threw it in, though?${prompt};
Maybe if I throw you in, then I'll get the gold...${prompt};
M-my apologies!${prompt};
...It's here!;
I found it! I really found it! My pouch!${prompt};
It's about time. Lose it again, and you'll be praying for mercy.${prompt};
We now return! See you later, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss]!${prompt};
S-sorry, we've got to be getting back now. But I thank you for your help from the bottom of my--${prompt};
It's time to go! Stop wasting time and get over here!${prompt};
W-wait up!${prompt};
You see a shadow for a split second, but it is difficult to make out anything from here.${prompt};
There you are!;
Finally...let's go home together!${prompt};
I'd sooner run with the chigoes.${prompt};
Seriously... Look at me! I've got it made... I've even got a slave now to do whatever I want! Life is a breeze since I've met him!${prompt};
Come on, Ellie... Let's perform together again! Our fans are waiting for us!${prompt};
Our fans...oh yes...${prompt};
But those are my fans, not ours. Everyone looks forward to my performance! You don't entertain anybody...${prompt};
All you do is stand there. Lately you hardly even touch the animator! Hopeless lout...${prompt};
B-but...${prompt};
I'm fine on my own, so stop worrying about me, okay? Get lost!${prompt};
Wait!;
I've seen a lot of performers who went solo and completely flopped!${prompt};
And I've seen a lot of performers who didn't need their useless partners.${prompt};
Eh...${prompt};
The point is, I'm not going back. I'm staying right here for now.${prompt};
That's...that's...${prompt};
That's...${prompt};
That's okay by me.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
I'm going home. I'll be back for you later, though.${prompt};
H-hey, wait just a minute here...${prompt};
Hmph, get out of here.${prompt};
Iruki-Waraki... You're not really leaving, are you?${prompt};
What else can I do? I will come back for her later, though.${prompt};
You will, won't you? You promise, right!?${prompt};
Um...uh...sure.${prompt};
Oh yes, in exchange for your promise and as an apology for stealing your automaton, please take this.${prompt};
This was the last thing the girl who wanted to become a puppetmaster left to me... Please take good care of it.${prompt};

You get the feeling you are about to make a discovery...${prompt};
A chill runs down your spine!${prompt};
This...this is...${prompt};
(Sniff sniff sniff...)${prompt};
Tickles Liliroon nose...like big, pooofy lotus flower scent...${prompt};
Liliroon is sure!;
This definitely his scent!${prompt};
But no one here...${prompt};
Liliroon? Could it really be you?${prompt};
?${prompt};
It is you!;
Do you remember me? We used to work together. It's me, Dashahan!${prompt};
Oooh, Dashahan! Yooo change so much Liliroon did not recognize! Dashahan become very fine person!${prompt};
I should say the same of you, Liliroon. I've heard about the work you're doing. Serving the Empress! Quite impressive!${prompt};
Have you also come to pay your respects?${prompt};
It all thanks to teacher...Liliroon's gooorooo!${prompt};
Yes...so you came to tell him of your success, didn't you?${prompt};
It trooo. Liliroon have much catch up on, and teacher also must have much! It been long since Liliroon speak with him.${prompt};
Liliroon?;
You came to pay your respects...right?${prompt};
Respects...?${prompt};
You mean...you haven't heard?${prompt};
Hear what?${prompt};
It's been two years now...${prompt};
All of a sudden, he fell, clutching at his chest...and...${prompt};
Well, you knew that he had a bad heart, didn't you?${prompt};
Ah... I see no one told you...${prompt};
Now he lies here, under the lotus blossoms that he loved so much...${prompt};
...It can't be...${prompt};
He continued his work until the very day he left this world.${prompt};
He always said that life wasn't long enough to experience all the scents in this world... He always felt that no matter how long he lived, his work would never be finished...${prompt};
Heheh. Those words really described the kind of person he was, didn't they?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Liliroon's gooorooo...always full of sooorprises.${prompt};
Liliroon expected him scold her like long ago...${prompt};
Tell Liliroon that nose bad and scent Liliroon made very pooor work...${prompt};
He wouldn't do that. Why, he was as proud of your accomplishments as if they were his own.${prompt};
Is that trooo?${prompt};
Of course it is. He used to talk about how amazing it was that a little Qiqirn could do such work all alone in a place as intimidating as the Imperial Palace.${prompt};
Then he'd start harping on us about how we should try to live up to the example you'd created.${prompt};
...${prompt};
He entrusted me with something to give to you if we should ever meet again...${prompt};
...Really? What is it...?${prompt};
This scent...${prompt};
It's empyrean incense... The professor finished his work before he died.${prompt};
!${prompt};
This incense is one of a kind... It is said to bring sublime happiness to anyone who burns it.${prompt};
Of course, that's just a saying used to describe what a wonderful fragrance it is...${prompt};
Apparently, only those with a vast field of aromatic knowledge and those who have mastered the art of perfumery are capable of creating this incense.${prompt};
His work was phenomenal... The scent of his incense is enough to make anyone feel content.${prompt};
Liliroon... Please burn it here.${prompt};
I'm convinced that the professor intended this incense for you, his dearest pupil...${prompt};
Okay...${prompt};
What's happening!?${prompt};
Teacher...;
Liliroon doing goood work now.${prompt};
Liliroon want to be perfooom maker as goood as yooo...${prompt};
That why Liliroon working so hard...${prompt};
...Eek!${prompt};
Basweema?;
What's wrong?${prompt};
Wh-who are you!?${prompt};
Get away from Basweema! If you don't, I'll...I'll...make you sorry!${prompt};
Oh no...my foot!${prompt};
Ahgdeen! Are you all right?${prompt};
Oh, the pain...everything's going dark... Basweema, I'm...I'm done for... My life may end here...${prompt};
There's something I wanted to tell you...${prompt};
But I didn't want to pressure you...${prompt};
So those words will die with me now...${prompt};
Even if I must leave this world, I want you to be happy. Goodbye, Basweema...${prompt};
No!;
Ahgdeen, hang in there! Open your eyes! Please!${prompt};
Ahgdeen!!!${prompt};
B-Basweema!${prompt};
To think that I could meet you even in death!${prompt};
This truly is heaven! Now I can live with you forever!${prompt};
Calm down, Ahgdeen. This isn't heaven, and you aren't dead.${prompt};
And I don't intend on finding happiness all on my own.${prompt};
...You mean to tell me it was all just a dream?${prompt};
It wasn't a dream, either. Will you stop it, already?${prompt};
I am glad you aren't hurt, though...${prompt};
Sorry for all the fuss. We didn't expect anyone to come by...${prompt};
You really surprised me! Hardly anybody ever comes here.${prompt};
You want to know what we were doing? Um...well...${prompt};
Th-there aren't that many places where, um...a couple can be alone in peace, you know?${prompt};
What are you so embarrassed about?${prompt};
Uh...anyway, what are you doing here? If you're lost, I'll help you find the way back to town!${prompt};
...You're not lost?${prompt};
M-my mother sent you to come find me!?${prompt};
I never expected her to follow me all the way to Nashmau...${prompt};
I'm sure you've figured this out by now, but my mother gets very upset when things don't go her way.${prompt};
She always wanted me to be her precious little boy. I had no freedom to make my own choices...${prompt};
Whenever I had an opinion, she would just ignore it and say, “Just leave everything to your old mom here”!${prompt};
I left because I couldn't stand it any longer, and I wandered, looking for my place in this world...${prompt};
And somehow, I ended up here...and met Basweema, who also happened to be passing through the area.${prompt};
She listened to my complaints and troubles, and ran her fingers through my hair for comfort...${prompt};
I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I cried like a baby. My mind had never been so at ease.${prompt};
Heh, I'm sorry. I'm rambling, aren't I?${prompt};
But anyway, that's the situation. I will not go home. Can you tell my mother that you couldn't find me?${prompt};
Ahgdeen...${prompt};
Come... Let's go meet your mother.${prompt};
What!? Why?${prompt};
I'm sure that if you tell her how you feel, she'll understand. Think of how devastated she'll be if you leave her like this.${prompt};
You don't know my mother. She could even try to drag me back home. I might never see you again...${prompt};
Ahgdeen, you're not as weak as you think. I'm sure you'll be okay.${prompt};
Basweema...${prompt};
You've helped me out in more ways than you can know. Thank you.${prompt};
I will have a talk with my mother.${prompt};
Do you think you could come along, too?${prompt};
I'm sure my mother wouldn't hurt Basweema, but still...I want you there to watch.${prompt};
Was the operation successful?${prompt};
I almost had him...but there was interference, and the operation ended in failure.${prompt};
I see... Your disguise will not work far from the mire...${prompt};
We must devise a new plan...${prompt};
Basweema!${prompt};
Ahgdeen!? But why?${prompt};
Ohoho, this is interesting. The fool yearns to become a sacrifice, does he? I am tired of this boy... Dispose of him.${prompt};
Basweema, please. Listen to what I have to say.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I want to be with you. I want to live together! I still feel that way, even now.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Please come with me, Basweema.${prompt};
There is nothing more pathetic than a man who begs...${prompt};
Ahhh!${prompt};
Run...hurry!${prompt};
Why did it have to come to this!?${prompt};
Controlled by your own desires... You are a disgrace to the Lamiae.${prompt};
It is time for you to rest, traitor!;
Basweema!!!;
Basweema! Stay with me, Basweema!${prompt};
Ahgdeen...?${prompt};
Heh...to think, I was about to turn you into a qutrub... Such a disappointment...${prompt};
Basweema...${prompt};
You know...I believe that not everyone who chooses an undead existence was charmed by the Lamiae...${prompt};
But there are some, like me, whose feelings are genuine...${prompt};
I don't want to lose you. I want to be together for all eternity...${prompt};
And if that means becoming a qutrub, I'm willing to do it!${prompt};
Ahgdeen...I have never met someone so kind.${prompt};
I have but one request. Please take me to the place where we first met.${prompt};
I'm really sorry my mother said such horrible things.${prompt};
There's no need for you to apologize. I'm okay, really.${prompt};
But I think I made a bad impression on your mother...${prompt};
It certainly is hard to win a mother-in-law's favor, isn't it?${prompt};
Heh, I'm sure that if you work at it, you'll be fine.${prompt};
Anyway, didn't you drop an earring somewhere around here a while ago?${prompt};
It was you who dropped it, while you were trying to see how it looked on me!${prompt};
Is that how it was...?${prompt};
You always forget things when they're your own fault...${prompt};
Ahgdeen?${prompt};
What is it?${prompt};
When you told me in front of your mother that you were going to marry me... I was very happy.${prompt};
But I betrayed both you and my kind...I hid the fact that I am a Lamia, and I couldn't even turn you into a qutrub.${prompt};
You are not weak, Ahgdeen... I was the weak one. I'm so sorry...${prompt};
Basweema... You betrayed no one. You protected me, even though you knew what it would cost you.${prompt};
Thank you...${prompt};
I'm going to tell you what I couldn't bring myself to say before...${prompt};
...;
What is it?${prompt};
I love you. More than anything.${prompt};
Basweema...? You heard me, right? Say something...${prompt};
You're not teasing me again, are you?${prompt};
Haha, you may have fooled me before, but you won't get me this time...${prompt};
So give it up already, all right? Open your eyes...${prompt};
Please?;
...Basweema...?${prompt};
All I wanted was to live happily together...${prompt};
But now, I can never have her back. So tell me, who is to blame for it?${prompt};
My mother, because she tried to force me to return home? You, because you came to search for me? Or the Lamia who hurt her?${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sorry. Pointing fingers won't bring her back...${prompt};
This is the ring I was going to give her.${prompt};
I intended to use it when I proposed to her, but that's not going to happen now...${prompt};
Goodbye, Basweema...${prompt};
You lost your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
Typical mercenary...${prompt};
Here, take this and get out of my sight!${prompt};
You...you lost another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt};
Do you know how long it takes to get those things reissued?${prompt};
Good-for-nothing, rock-headed mercenaries!;
Take your worthless hide out of here and gimme time to forget your oafish face!${prompt};
Hey, admiral-type person!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Where is this ship headed to?${prompt};
Dvucca Isle.${prompt};
Oho.${prompt};
Now I know our destination.;
We're going to Periqia.${prompt};
He's right, isn't he?${prompt};
Periqia...${prompt};
I've heard stories about that place.${prompt};
A long time ago, it was said to have been a base for the Ephramadian corsairs, who would terrorize merchant vessels sailing the neighboring waters.${prompt};
<Shiver>...;
They attacked innocent traders?${prompt};
Traders from Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
But one day the corsairs were caught in a violent storm, and they all sank to the bottom of the ocean.${prompt};
Not all of us...${prompt};
...?${prompt};
What has become of Periqia without the corsairs?${prompt};
Could the ghosts we've been hearing about have taken over the base?${prompt};
Spirits of the corsairs, maybe...?${prompt};
Hmph.;
And how would you feel if that were the case?${prompt};
I would be...${prompt};
Excited!${prompt};
Yes, this all sounds very exciting!${prompt};
Exciting?;
You could be killed.${prompt};
But...but...;
Just because they're ghosts now, doesn't mean they don't remember their families and friends, right?${prompt};
They would have to be sad, and lonely, and...${prompt};
...suffering all this time, missing their loved ones.${prompt};
They probably repented their evil pirate ways and vowed to be good from now on...${prompt};
And...${prompt};
And?${prompt};
And the crew of this ship has been so nice to us!${prompt};
They were a little frightening at first...${prompt};
But they even gave me oil when my helmet started creaking.${prompt};
Is that right...?${prompt};
!?${prompt};
...${prompt};
What is it, Admiral?${prompt};
Silence!;
That sound...;
There's no mistaking it!${prompt};
Oh yes, now I hear it.;
Sounds like an apkallu being strangled to death...${prompt};
I will never forget that sound...${prompt};
Never forget the tears...the blood...the bones...of that day.${prompt};
Blood?${prompt};
Bones?${prompt};
Lamiae...${prompt};
That sound is the shriek of the whistle used by the Imperial Army to control their pet Lamiae.${prompt};
That can't be right.;
Lamiae are enemies of the Empire.${prompt};
Those that broke free.${prompt};
It was two hundred years ago when our hideout was invaded by biological weapons of destruction, sent by the Imperial forces in an attempt to extinguish the last of the corsairs.${prompt};
Those monstrosities were the artificially created Lamiae.${prompt};
You're lying!;
The Lamiae attack everyone, even the capital of Al Zahbi!${prompt};
Heh.;
Their pets turn against them.${prompt};
They were just one of the many heinous blunders made by the Empire.${prompt};
The Imperial Army--and Aht Urhgan--is invincible!${prompt};
Why would they bother with anything as hideous as the Lamiae!?;
Besides, the Empress would never allow it!${prompt};
You doubt me?;
Come see for yourself!${prompt};
What should we do, Aphmau?;
He must be lying.${prompt};
Of course he is.;
It can't be true...${prompt};
If the Grand Vizier were here, he would say:${prompt};
“Trust your own eyes.”${prompt};
You've found nothing?${prompt};
Grand Vizier.;
We are scouring every inch, but this place is like a labyrinth...${prompt};
Spare me your excuses.${prompt};
I accepted your proposal to make use of the Lamiae's acute sense of smell in spite of vocal protest from the generals, and against my better judgment.${prompt};
Understand that you will not be leaving this rock until Her Magnificence is back under our protection.${prompt};
These Lamiae have been enhanced through advanced alchemical processes, Grand Vizier.${prompt};
I assure you, we will locate the Empress.${prompt};
You better hope you are right.${prompt};
You seem surprised, ${name-player}.${prompt};
This operation should never have been necessary.${prompt};
I must admit, I did not expect you to be here to witness it.${prompt};
As I feared...${prompt};
Who is that? The one in red armor?${prompt};
It looks like the Grand Vizier...${prompt};
It can't be!;
There must be some mistake...${prompt};
You seem distraught.;
Does it shock you to see your countrymen working alongside those abominations?${prompt};
Or perhaps...you know this man in red armor?${prompt};
Yes...${prompt};
And so you should.;
He is, after all--${prompt};
My brother...${prompt};
What?${prompt};
He is my brother...${prompt};
What are the Lamiae saying?${prompt};
That she is close...very close...${prompt};
Then cover this area again!;
Leave no pebble undisturbed!${prompt};
Your will...${prompt};
No...${prompt};
!;
My mercenary...${prompt};
Of course!;
This is just some horrible misunderstanding.${prompt};
There's some big picture that I'm just not seeing.;
All I have to do is ask!${prompt};
Razfahd!;
...${prompt};
You force my hand...;
Come along with me...${prompt};
!;
Nash...${prompt};
What...what are you doing here, Razfahd?${prompt};
I received a report that you had been abducted.;
Are you unhurt?${prompt};
I'm fine, obviously.${prompt};
So you're the one who took her...${prompt};
No, he didn't do anything!${prompt};
I followed him of my own free will!${prompt};
You followed him?;
What were you thinking?${prompt};
You can't just chase after every strange character who catches your eye...${prompt};
Do you have any idea of the danger...?${prompt};
...${prompt};
You're trying to lecture me?${prompt};
You're the one who's working alongside Lamiae--sworn enemies of the Empire!${prompt};
Don't you understand?;
I was using these creatures to look for you.${prompt};
That's no excuse.;
Those “creatures” are evil savages!${prompt};
You're the one who used to tell me that when I was a child!;
Are you saying that was a lie?${prompt};
Grand Vizier!;
Answer her question!${prompt};
Calm down, Aphmau...${prompt};
Answer the question!${prompt};
Are you saying you don't have an answer?${prompt};
Listen to me, Aphmau.;
These creations are not the same Lamiae I have taught you to fear and despise.${prompt};
They are aiding our army, as allies to the people of Aradjiah.${prompt};
They are like your mercenary, ${name-player}.;
You have nothing to fear from them.${prompt};
Mercenaries...? Like ${name-player}?${prompt};
That's right.${prompt};
Ahahaha...${prompt};
Your lies know no bounds.${prompt};
Nothing to fear?${prompt};
Not for their twisted masters, perhaps.${prompt};
“Allies to the people of Aradjiah,” you say?${prompt};
These vicious demonesses that feasted on the flesh of my still-living companions!?${prompt};
Who are you?;
And what would you know of it?${prompt};
I know all your filthy secrets.${prompt};
The words of a lunatic.${prompt};
That costume you wear...;
You are descendant of the corsairs?${prompt};
No, they wouldn't dare show themselves so openly.${prompt};
I know who you are...${prompt};
And now that you know?${prompt};
Will you set your pets on me?${prompt};
Just as your ancestors did?${prompt};
It can't be...${prompt};
Is it true, what he says?${prompt};
Grand Vizier.;
We require an answer.${prompt};
Aphmau...${prompt};
Do you remember the last words of our father?${prompt};
...${prompt};
“We are the Emperor.;
The Emperor and Aht Urhgan are as one...”${prompt};
!;
Words that you took for your own.;
They do more than describe the absolute authority of the Emperor...${prompt};
They also signify a responsibility.${prompt};
A responsibility to protect the lives of the tens of thousands of citizens from our countless enemies within and without the vast territories of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
There are times when carrying out this responsibility requires extreme measures.${prompt};
But...${prompt};
Those are not the only words he used.${prompt};
He also said, “A heavy hand is not needed to govern an empire.”${prompt};
“A gentle hand will guide the people.”${prompt};
Anyone can see that the use of Lamiae is going too far.;
You're twisting the spirit of his teachings.${prompt};
Aphmau...;
A time will come when you will understand.${prompt};
You always do this.${prompt};
Whenever an important matter arises, you treat me like a child.;
I'm supposed to listen to whatever you decide.${prompt};
And you expect me to accept the responsibilities of an empress?${prompt};
Nashmeira!${prompt};
You do not have the will to be Empress.${prompt};
You are not prepared to allow your subjects to bleed while you remain unsullied on your throne.${prompt};
Why is this role so hard for you to comprehend?${prompt};
If I'm so unsuitable...${prompt};
Why...;
Why don't you become Emperor!?${prompt};
This isn't a game, Nashmeira!${prompt};
Listen to me!${prompt};
I was once destined to sit the Imperial throne...${prompt};
But as our father lay on his deathbed, he named you as his successor.${prompt};
I don't know what you're talking about...${prompt};
I...I...${prompt};
Do you know why?${prompt};
How should I know?;
I don't want to know...${prompt};
I never wanted to be Empress in the first place!${prompt};
Let me tell you why.${prompt};
At the time when our father named you successor...${prompt};
...the blood of beasts flowed in my veins, just as it does in these creations.${prompt};
The same blue blood that you and our father despise.${prompt};
!${prompt};
I didn't...;
I never...${prompt};
Just listen.;
It was unavoidable.${prompt};
It happened while you were living at the temple...${prompt};
I received a mortal wound while fighting on the eastern front at the behest of our father.${prompt};
!${prompt};
The only chance I had to survive was a transfusion of regenerative blood from a monstrous donor.${prompt};
I never knew...${prompt};
Now do you understand?${prompt};
I do...${prompt};
Now please, do as I say and return to the palace.${prompt};
I will, but...${prompt};
You think this is over!?${prompt};
Do you think I will let two members of the Imperial family simply walk away!?${prompt};
Rider in darkness...;
You have my gratitude!${prompt};
Thank you for this opportunity to avenge my people.${prompt};
Your cursed bloodline ends here!;
!?${prompt};
What's happening to the admiral!?${prompt};
I've seen this creature somewhere...${prompt};
The Dark Rider...${prompt};
Underworld cur!${prompt};
Meet your doom!;
Hee hee, hee hee!${prompt};
Didn't expect this to happen so soon!${prompt};
Luzaf, no!;
Nashmeira! Stay back!${prompt};
Hmm?;
What's goin' on here? Boss...?;
Flit!?${prompt};
Quickly, take us to the ship!${prompt};
Hang about!;
Are you tryin' to give me orders?${prompt};
Just do it!${prompt};
Nashmeira! What are you doing!?${prompt};
Flit, please, there's no time!;
The ship! Now!${prompt};
R-right!${prompt};
I'm sorry, Razfahd.;
I have to help him.${prompt};
Stop!;
Farewell.${prompt};
Don't worry about us.${prompt};
We'll be fine...${prompt};
You came all this way for me...;
Forgive me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Please. Be the one friend I need!;
Dammit.${prompt};
Nashmeira...${prompt};
Grand Vizier.;
I have an urgent report...${prompt};
You are certain?${prompt};
Yes, my lord.;
We must return at once.${prompt};
${name-player}.${prompt};
This opponent is beyond the capabilities of a single mercenary.${prompt};
Your mission to locate Aphmau is over...${prompt};
I release you from your duty.${prompt};
Her Magnificence is with the admiral of the Black Coffin.${prompt};
Luzaf!?${prompt};
Reassign the Immortals searching for Aphmau to surveillance of the Ashu Talif.${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
Luzaf...;
He may have been chosen to become the next rider.;
Be on your guard.${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
Speak not a word of this to anyone.${prompt};
Especially to the president of Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Your remuneration will be sent ahead of you.;
Tell your employer your mission from the palace is complete.${prompt};
Dismissed.${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
You see an unusual stone tablet. It is emitting a faint light from its engraving.${prompt};
You see an unusual stone tablet. It is emitting a radiant light from its engraving.${prompt};
Sprinkle some salt on the tablet?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
The stone tablet quickly absorbs the salt and begins giving off a metallic grating sound...${prompt};
The salt grains patter against the stone tablet and scatter all over the ground. You could have sworn hearing the tinkling sound of a bell...${prompt};
You see an engraved stone tablet.;
A slight warmth is radiating from its surface.${prompt};
Place your hand on the tablet?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You have endured much and served well to come here bearing these items.;
You have been deemed worthy and shall now be instructed.${prompt};
Take yourself to the ruins known as Nyzul Isle.${prompt};
It is there, perhaps, that we are fated to meet at last...${prompt};
It appears to be the grave of a great soul to an age long past.${prompt};
You offer up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, and ${item-singular: 2[2]}... ${prompt};
You sense an ominous presence...${prompt};
The heady fragrance of wine pervades the air...${prompt};
Minute glittering fragments are scattered all over...${prompt};
Broken shards of insect wing are scattered all over...${prompt};
The ground is strewn with shed leaves...${prompt};
Piles of pamama peels litter the ground...${prompt};
The ground is smeared with bloodstains...${prompt};
Numerous strands of hair are scattered all over...${prompt};
Broken shards of insect wing are scattered all over...${prompt};
A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...${prompt};

The ground is smeared with bloodstains...${prompt};
Something draws near!${prompt};
I had no doubt that you would come, ${name-player}.;
As I said, an indomitable spirit, indeed. It is not within you to concede defeat so easily.${prompt};
Perhaps you are now asking yourself how this could be? Granted, the visage you see before you is but a remnant of my former self.;
The arms which I amassed during my reign conferred such otherworldly power upon me that even after death, I was able to remain in this world.${prompt};
Should one of my arms fall within the hands of one deemed unworthy or impure, the Empire would be damned to a fate of fire and ash.;
That much is certain. Such is the power of the mythic weapons, and cause for their safekeeping all these years.${prompt};
The fear of such an occurrence led me to imbue the mythic weapons with my very essence to further hinder their powers.;
This was to serve as the last bastion of defense, should the vigil weapons ever be lost and my arms left unguarded.${prompt};
Yet, it would now seem that even that role has come to an end.;
These tumultuous times have ushered in changes the likes of which this world has never seen.${prompt};
${name-player}, it falls to the likes of you to shoulder the burden now.;
Waver not, and bend the might of ${item-singular: 0[2]} to your will, and with it bring an end to this era of shadows.${prompt};
Your epic journey is near complete.;
Come, then, and show me the weapon you have brought all this way.${prompt};
For the time is nigh for the fetters to be undone!;
By the hand of ${name-player}, the world shall bear witness to the true power of ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Relinquish your weapon to me now, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} which you bear.;
A requiem for the spirit which guards it will set it at peace, and thus the last barrier shall be breached.${prompt};
So, you think yourself prepared?;
Very well, then. Let us proceed.${prompt};
Let the vigil over this arm be ended. Your watch is over, good spirit.;
Rest now, my friend. Rest now, forever. Sleep now the untroubled sleep of the angels...${prompt};
At last, my arm is complete again!;
Word shall be brought to the royal line. It will be known that their ancestor sends them a mighty gift.${prompt};
Farewell for now, ${name-player}.;
Go well...;
I know when it's not safe to be around a woman any longer, so being the sensible man I am, I took off like lightning. Of course, she came after me at top speed. I guess I am rather hard to resist, and I do appreciate the thrill of the chase...${prompt};
I finally managed to escape, but when I stopped to catch my breath, I noticed a beautiful scale clinging to my arm.${prompt};
It was the last trace of her I had. I had hoped she would catch me...I wished...${wait-36: 2};
Oh, how I missed her.${prompt};
And then, at that moment, rain began pouring from the skies!${prompt};
The only souvenir of our destined meeting was washed away forever!${prompt};
How could this happen to me!?${prompt};
How...could this...happen...${prompt};

The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};

He's a soulflayer.;
He's a blue mage.;
I have no idea.${prompt};
Hehe. I see...;
So this is the m-m-magic I've heard so much about.${prompt};
And it appears he is looking to use his power to revive this Falak creature.${prompt};
<Wheeze>...;
Falak... All...will be...devoured...${prompt};
Ah, yes... Falak...${prompt};
I heard about him from that m-m-motley group known as the Destiny Destroyers.${prompt};
Falak first appeared in Aht Urhgan several thousand years ago, after being born from the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt};
They said that the egg was never broken, allowing him to hatch from it undisturbed.${prompt};
The terrible m-m-monster laid waste to all around it, and devoured everything that stood in its path.${prompt};
Then, the beastmen known as the Mamool Ja engaged the creature in a terrible battle that lasted m-m-many nights...${prompt};
Eventually, they m-m-managed to defeat Falak and separated its body into nine separate pieces.${prompt};
However, even that did not kill the beast.${prompt};
So they scattered the pieces in m-m-multiple locations across the land, sealing them away for eternity.${prompt};
Hehe... It possesses a rather potent life force.;
If the stories are true, then it is likely an actual terrestrial avatar.${prompt};
If possible, I should have liked to m-m-meet this Falak and obtain its strength as my own.${prompt};
<Wheeze>...;

Erk!? <Cough, gasp>...;
Hm? What is this?${prompt};
I... I am no longer a blue mage...${prompt};
It appears the m-m-magical power within you has been absorbed by this “Prison Orb.”${prompt};
If you are looking for som-m-meone to blame, you should blame your m-m-master for doing this to you.${prompt};
Why would I want someone to blame?;
In fact, I should be thanking you.${prompt};
I am the Immortal known as Amnaf.${prompt};
Hm!? Is that you, ${name-player}!?${prompt};
Tell me, what happened to the Grand Vizier!?${prompt};
I see... I am relieved to hear that he is well.${prompt};
What!? Wait, does that mean that he has gone on to Valhalla too?${prompt};
No, I cannot dwell on that now...;
There is important news that concerns the fate of the Empire.;
I need you to report something back to Captain Raubahn for me.${prompt};
There is a large-scale war brewing in Valhalla, land of the chosen souls...${prompt};
There is an open rebellion against Odin, the god who controls Valhalla.${prompt};
The mage leading the rebellion appeared alongside a massive dragon...${prompt};
What did you say!?;
He used magic to convert countless souls into his minions, bringing them back to life in an effort to force open the gate to Valhalla.${prompt};
He has also chosen Rishfee's soul among them, in order to use the power of the blue mages...${prompt};
That is why I went to meet this mage, in order to find Rishfee.${prompt};
The mage said he was looking to bring about the resurrection of Falak in Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
That he wished to bring chaos down upon the land of the living.${prompt};
Wait! What is this m-m-mage's name!?${prompt};
His name is...;
<Cough, gasp>...;
Forgive me, I...;
Hang in there!;
Rishfee...;
You must save him...;
Blast! We alm-m-most had the answer we were looking for!${prompt};
What should I do in regards to Falak...${prompt};
No, I m-m-must first figure out how the gate to Valhalla can be opened...${prompt};
Hmm... They m-m-must've found something upsetting within the facility.${prompt};
Don't worry about it! It doesn't matter when we were born or when we die!${prompt};
B-but this truth is almost too shocking to believe...${prompt};
Hraaaah! We mandragora were created by humans!${prompt};
That just means you have kin such as Lamiae, puks, and Merrows right there with you!${prompt};
So don't worry about it! Just focus on living your best life now.;
That's all that matters, got it!?${prompt};
Hraaaah! The chosen elite such as yourself can't possibly understand what I'm feeling!${prompt};
The mandragora should never have been born, so we were abandoned!${prompt};
Hey! Who are you calling elite!?${prompt};
Come on now, let's all settle down.${prompt};
The real villains here are the ones who dreamed up such a hideous plan in the first place.${prompt};
They are toying with actual lives here. We should be blaming the alchemists, not each other.${prompt};
Hraaaah! That Moblin is gonna pay for this!${prompt};
Huh!? Megomak is a good friend who gives us a place to stay!${prompt};
See, that's what I'm talking about! Those of us who've been abandoned would rather live freezing under a bridge!${prompt};
Now, now... Try to calm down a bit.${prompt};
Maybe we shouldn't have agreed to Megomak's request.${prompt};
W-we located the egg he's looking for, but it's not going to be easy...${prompt};
I don't get what he's so mad about...;
Mandragoras are a completely different story.${prompt};
M-m-my head is starting to hurt just listening to all this..${prompt};
Should we get m-m-moving?;
Hm? What's with that puppet?;
Stop right there, Uran-Mafran.${prompt};
The Empress has ordered me to escort you back to Al Zahbi.${prompt};
What?;
First, I will need to take your belongings.${prompt};
Wait! Wait right there!;
Huh!? Who is this!?${prompt};

Hey! What's gotten into you!?${prompt};
T-try to calm down...${prompt};
Hm? What is going on here, ${name-player}?${prompt};
It's a little hard to explain. We m-m-might want to silence that talking plant first though.${prompt};
Settle down, citrullus.${prompt};
Who are you calling a citrullus!?${prompt};

Hraaaah!;
Skreee!;

Beatin' on innocent beings like that without even listening to what they have to say first!${prompt};

Mandragoras are actually chimeras.;

Magh Bihu was abandoned.${prompt};
Chimeras: the creation of life using forbidden alchemy techniques.${prompt};

However, that is not what I want to know.${prompt};
