${choice: 0}[Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!];
It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
Why, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!${prompt};
I wish you speed upon your journey.${prompt};
You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.${prompt};
Come back when you have the requisite certification.${prompt};
Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.${prompt};
Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?;
Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt};
The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt};
Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt};
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};
You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt};
In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt};
One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt};
Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt};
The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt};
You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt};
There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt};
The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt};
When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt};
A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt};
The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt};
I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt};
Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of ${number: 0} imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt};
It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt};
The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt};
The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt};
We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt};
The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt};
The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt};
We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt};
Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt};
The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt};
Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt};
We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt};
Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt};
The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt};
It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt};
Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number ${number: 1}.${prompt};

Behavioral research.;

Nothing.${prompt};
Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt};
It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt};
The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt};
Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt};
If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt};
While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt};
Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt};
For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt};
Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt};
You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt};
By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt};
The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt};
Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt};
Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt};
The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt};
Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt};
The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt};
The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt};
While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt};
Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt};
This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt};
Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt};
The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt};
Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt};
This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt};

Stop!${prompt};
Take a look. The fertilizer I used has created such succulent bounty.${prompt};
At the very least, wait until they are fully ripe!${prompt};
The plants might give birth to monsters? You're...you're serious, aren't you?${prompt};
But then all my work...${prompt};
By the Goddess!${prompt};
Gyaaaaaaaaah!!!${prompt};
Help meeeeee!;
Please, no!;
I told you! Get back!${prompt};
Outta the way!!!;
Erisa, are you okay?${prompt};
I-I think so.${prompt};
That's why I told you to give us the plants. You were lucky things didn't turn out worse.${prompt};
So, the stories were true. I suspected as much.${prompt};
I will make a direct appeal to Gratzigg to prohibit bringing these seeds into the city proper.${prompt};
But first, to clean up this mess here. We have to make sure no more are strewn about the area.${prompt};
I wonder if these monsters were really trying to attack us.${prompt};
Kyff, are you out of your mind? You saw what they did just now!${prompt};
Well, when Erisa tried to stop it, it backed down as if it were listening to her...${prompt};
Now I'm certain there's something wrong with you. Since when can monsters understand language? Now get back to cleaning this place up!${prompt};
Y-yes, of course.${prompt};
Pardon my brashness, but, um...would it be possible for you to bring these to Erisa for me?${prompt};
They're some seeds I came across in the forest.${prompt};
Oh, there's no need for worry. They are just seeds of the first plants that she ever grew.${prompt};
I know that this experiment took a bad turn, but not knowing what might occur is precisely why her research is necessary.${prompt};
I don't want her to give up her studies.${prompt};
Kyff! Stop blabbering and get over here!${prompt};
I'll be right there!${prompt};
Thank you for doing this.${prompt};
Kyff asked you to take some seeds to Erisa? She certainly did seem a bit down. I'm sure the seeds will cheer her up.${prompt};
The new breed of plant has been replaced by a more common species.${prompt};
The plant sways gently back and forth.${prompt};
I don't need to tell you that raptor fights are one-on-one competitions between two raptors. Predictably, the raptor that successfully makes its way through the brackets to the end is declared the champion.${prompt};
Recently, everyone's eye has been on Vicious Vorahal. His spinning kick has carried him to near-limitless victories in the arena, and many a maiden has thrown her handkerchief into the ring in support.${prompt};
Still, a good deal root for another competitor--Tenacious Tirrod--as a bit of a guilty pleasure.${prompt};
He's an underdog to be sure, having no trophies to his name, but his never-say-die attitude has won the hearts of his supporters.${prompt};
Did you manage to catch the raptors yet?${prompt};
I caught a glimpse of one over there, but it vanished before I could subdue it.${prompt};
You too? You wouldn't think something so large could be so nimble.${prompt};
How could that guy manage to catch one...?${prompt};
Using a trap, of course.${prompt};
Who's there? What are you doing with that raptor? They're meant to be “taken care of”!${prompt};
Who do you think it is?${prompt};
Ilney! I told you to lay low!${prompt};
What do you expect me to do, seeing you bumbling around? As soon as it's captured, I'm outta here.${prompt};
A simple matter, really. I used the rockberries to lure them in, and they were like putty in my hands.${prompt};
That raptor you captured earlier? He let himself get caught to protect this one. It almost moved me to tears.${prompt};
So that's how you did it...${prompt};
Have a look. If I give this one a few good whacks, the other one will come rushing in to protect him.${prompt};
What did I tell you?${prompt};
Aren't you...the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who came to my house before?${prompt};
You appear to have recovered splendidly from your wounds, Ilney.${prompt};
Hmph. I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling mummers.${prompt};
Caught in the act, indeed. When I went to go see Vorahal, I tinkered with his cage.${prompt};
Y-you tricked us! You never had any intention of cooperating, did you?${prompt};
What goes around comes around. You put on such a stellar performance that I should invite you to join with the Mummers!${prompt};
A-as if I'd ever join your useless coalition! It's only fit for pranksters and miscreants!${prompt};
Miscreants, you say?${prompt};
The way I see it, the only miscreants here are the ones who brought some trumped-up charges against innocent raptors!${prompt};
I-I was just...${prompt};
What's going on here?${prompt};
Maester Gratzigg!${prompt};
Look who descends from the heavens just when his lackeys need him most. You wouldn't happen to know anything about this raptor incident, would you, Gratzigg?${prompt};
I was just looking into it myself. Something is clearly amiss.${prompt};
Amiss, indeed. The raptors breaking free, attacking innocents--evidently your people were involved in this sham of an operation!${prompt};
What's the meaning of this!?${prompt};
Maester, f-forgive...${prompt};
How dare you spew such lies!${prompt};
Flaviria, please accept my apologies on behalf of our coalition. My subordinates acted without my consent.${prompt};
Accept your apologies? Well, that depends. I'm sure the Scouts' Coalition would love to get wind of such a farcical scheme!${prompt};
...;
Drawing attention to this incident won't do any good for either of us.${prompt};
My point is that something like this will never happen again. You know I'll be true to my word because I need to save face as a coalition leader.${prompt};
Well...I suppose I can forgive you.${prompt};
You have my gratitude, Maester. I'll return the captured raptors to you immediately. Come.${prompt};
Well, well, those foot soldiers aren't the only ones capable of putting on a good show.${prompt};
Didn't you notice it?${prompt};
Gratzigg's words may have been pretty, but I know better.${prompt};
He'll do whatever it takes to stop pioneers from exploring the lands.${prompt};
And that man named Ilney--I'm almost certain he reports to the Ulbuka Wardens.${prompt};
Have you never heard of them? They are staunchly opposed to what we are doing in Ulbuka. It does not surprise me in the least that they would be in league with the Peacekeepers.${prompt};
But enough political lessons for today. We have got fights to plan!${prompt};
Would you mind going back to Pagnelle and telling her the raptors are safe and accounted for?${prompt};
You've seen for yourself what a worrywart she is. She'll be waiting for good news.${prompt};
Please forgive us for the raptor incident.${prompt};
That being said, shouldn't you be heading back to the Mummers' Coalition to let them know the raptors are safe and unharmed?${prompt};
The renowned Watergarden Coliseum Fights are currently in session. Care for a view?${prompt};
See the greatest show on Ulbuka?;
${selection-lines};
I'm chomping at the bit!;
Such vulgarities are beneath me.${prompt};
What a shame. I wish I could go in your place...${prompt};
Let me show you in. You're going to have one hell of a time!${prompt};
Ladies and Gentlemen!${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is proud to present to you...the famous, the one and only...raptor fights!${prompt};
Our first bout today features two of our most imposing specimens.${prompt};
In the right corner, with a body hard as mythril, it's Fearless Fismar!${prompt};
And in the left corner, the indomitable scourge of Ulbuka, Tenacious Tirrod!${prompt};
Only the victor will be eligible to move on to the next round, folks. Which will light the flames of conquest? Which will dive into the depths of obscurity?${prompt};
Let the battle commence!;
Wasn't that dramatic, folks?${prompt};
And now, our final event of the day!${prompt};
You know him, you love him, and above all you fear him, the undisputed champion of the ring...Vicious Vorahal!${prompt};
Who among us could fathom that Tirrod would survive to face Vorahal in the arena!?${prompt};
Will he be able to claim the crown for the first time in his career?${prompt};
Or will he fall, like so many before him?${prompt};
The decisive bout is about to get underway, folks!${prompt};
And...here they go!;
What's this? The two of them just staring each other down? Is this some cunning plan, or have the two lost the will to fight!?;
Here comes Tirrod, preparing to make his first move!;
But there's Vorahal with the dodge!;
And here comes the returning blow--a body slam right to the torso--but Tirrod seems unfazed!;
Tirrod prepares for another advance...but he's a bit dazed, perhaps thrown off balance from Vorahal's assault!?;
Vorahal, sensing an opportunity, comes back with a 360-degree revolving attack!;
Tirrod staves it off with his tail!!! Could this be any more dramatic, folks!?;
Wait--Vorahal is preparing for--could it be--his famed special attack!?${prompt};
There it is!!! The famed Raking Tornado, right to the head!;
And...${prompt};
And we have a winner! Vicious Vorahal successfully defends his crown!!!${prompt};
But Tenacious Tirrod put on quite the impressive performance! Come on, everyone, let's give our competitors a huge round of applause!${prompt};
That certainly was quite the spectacle.${prompt};
And before you accuse me: no, I wasn't stealing any glances.${prompt};
This is the Watergarden Coliseum, where the Mummers' Coalition holds periodic rrraptor fights.${prompt};

Welcome to the Rala Waterways, our little “home away from home,” if you can call it that.;
A little ways in is the Civic Arboretum, where we grow vegetables to help feed Adoulin.${prompt};
In better days, good-for-nothing kids would abscond down here and engage in all manner of miscreant behavior.${prompt};
Now, though, monsters have taken root, forcing all but the most hearty aboveground.${prompt};
Another one of the Peacekeeperrrs' cronies, here to cause trouble in the name of “orrrder”?${prompt};
We've no need of your help. Surrre, some of our plantations have been shut down, but we're getting along fine.${prompt};
I suppose I can grant you entrance into the Civic Arboretum.${prompt};
I wouldn't go much farther, though. Things have gotten quite hairy with all the monsters popping up of late.${prompt};
I'll let you in on a little secretaru!;
The Peacekeepers' Coalition puts on a brave front, but even they don't know where the monsters-wonsters came from!${prompt};
I betaru that they were able to get in because the buildings around here are old and decrepit. A perfectaru breeding ground, if you will.${prompt};
These vegetables don't satiate my hungerrr...what I really want are some good fish!${prompt};
Lucky for me there are some good fishing spots right around the Arrrboretum.${prompt};
We put all our effortaru into cultivating these vegetables, but they pale in comparison to what we could grow aboveground.${prompt};
Who am I? Oh, I representaru the Civic Arboretum Workers' Union. Pleased to make your acquaintance.${prompt};
Ever since my hubby lost his boat, the lovely Arciela has been so good to us.${prompt};
She even helped the two of us find employment down here.${prompt};
It's a far sight better than doing nothing! And in an odd way, I've come to think of these lovely little plants as my children.${prompt};
Whaddya want? Can't you see I'm busy?${prompt};
Ohoho, look at my precious little babies, growing so big!${prompt};
My my, you sweeties sure are looking pretty! I bet you could make Arciela jealous!${prompt};
Oy, Mukki, you'd better not be sucking up all the nutrients, y'hear!?${prompt};
What's wrong with you? Not enough fertilizer or somethin'?${prompt};
<Sigh> How long am I going to have to spend in this hellhole?${prompt};
Damned beasts destroyed my ship, and it'll take years before I can save up enough money for a new one...${prompt};
I've even had to rope my wife into working, too. What kind of a husband does that?${prompt};
Why howdy-wowdy, stranger! I'm Jaroney-Baroney, geomancer in training!${prompt};
The cyclical flow of wataru in the area helps to maintain balance not just for the vegetables we grow, but also for geomantic-wantic harmony.${prompt};
My master sent me down here to study the flow of energy in this area, and my heartaru is aflutter with what I might learn!${prompt};
I-I'm really in for it now! They sent me for maintenance...where all the monsters are!?${prompt};
My superiors bestowed on me a rune of p-protection, but...even if it works on monsters, it doesn't do a thing f-for my nerves!${prompt};
You stand at the Peacekeepers' Coalition's outpost in Rala Waterways. I, Relentless Storm, am in charge of our operations in the area.${prompt};
I wouldn't go past the gates if I were you...but if you're determined, make sure you're prepared for the dangers within.${prompt};
And I don't just mean the monsters. Which gates are opening depends on the day and time, so if you aren't careful, you may find yourself in trouble should you need to beat a hasty retreat!${prompt};
This area is off-limits to outsiders. Now step back.${prompt};
A strange design is etched into the gate.${prompt};
Open the gates？;
${selection-lines};
Forward we go!;
Retreat!${prompt};
Leaving so soon?;
${selection-lines};
Yup.;
No way.${prompt};
A strange design is etched into the gate.;
The gate snaps shut! ${name-player} leaps back from its doors.;
${color-alt: 15}Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} crumbles to dust and extricates myriad faculties buried deeply within you.;
A crumpled sheet of parchment rests at the bottom of the chest.${prompt};
The Civic Arboretum provides us with a stable food source, but finding provisions wasn't always so simple.${prompt};
The Adoulin Islands are so tiny that space was at a premium. Only the smallest of orchards could prosper in any sort of way.${prompt};
We imported all of our other comestibles. For example, Zulkheim flour has always been a hot commodity in these parts.${prompt};
Of course, the arboretum isn't some agricultural panacea. We still have to rely mainly on trade with other countries for most victuals.${prompt};
Hopefully this place will be the first step in self-sufficiency for our nation.${prompt};
Something descended from the ceiling with nary a warning!${prompt};
What entity keeps the Sacred City safe?${prompt};
Thank you for meeting me here.${prompt};
I understand you've found out a good deal of the...task I asked of you.${prompt};
If you're going to call me out for a meeting, I'd prrrefer going somewhere with a spot of tea.${prompt};
Don't you think, Margret?${prompt};
Our boss has her hands full, so I'll be our rrrepresentative at this little repartee.${prompt};
As you will.${prompt};
But I'm afraid there will be no imbibing of beverages today.${prompt};
The only water we have around is that running beneath our feet, and I'm not convinced of its drinkability.${prompt};
Let's cut to the quick. Who stands to benefit the most from Melvien's death?${prompt};
Who benefits the most?;
${selection-lines};
Arciela.;
Margret.;
Estienneux.;
The Ulbuka Wardens.;
I do.${prompt};
Surely you can't be serious! Now shut your trap and listen. It was...${prompt};
Estienneux. Exactly.${prompt};
As aide to the minister of finance, he was first in line to succeed his superior--and he has done precisely that, as acting minister.${prompt};
And if Adoulin's economic upswing continues, it's only a matter of time before the “acting” part is dropped.${prompt};
He gathered some volumes from the library and recommended them to his unwitting master.${prompt};
He knew as well as any of us that Melvien was partial to historical nonfiction.${prompt};
He was fully entranced by what he found within, and devoured every last drop of knowledge.${prompt};
Spurred on by what he found, he set foot into the jungle, alone, where he was quickly ripped to shreds as monster chow. It's the most logical explanation.${prompt};
At least, that's what the Ulbuka Wardens think.${prompt};
They believe it was a sinister plot orchestrated by those in favor of colonization.${prompt};
Their theory goes, then, that the supporters tried to make it seem like opponents of colonization had done the deeds with the goal of swaying public opinion in their favor.${prompt};
It's a pretty picture they paint, but upon closer inspection, the lines waver and the canvas is discolored.${prompt};
Perhaps you can defend yourself.${prompt};
I'm surrre you must have been quite saddened by the death of your onetime classmate, dear Margret.${prompt};
And what does that mean?${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition isn't the only organization in this city with its ears to the ground.${prompt};
You and Melvien always shared a close platonic bond.${prompt};
Yes, so much so that none questioned your constant comings and goings from Malecroix Manor.${prompt};
You said yourself--his aide went to the library to borrrow a volume of some import.${prompt};
Let's follow this line of thinking down the rabbit hole.${prompt};
There's only one person who could waltz into Melvien's residence while Estienneux was away without arousing any suspicion.${prompt};
And what if that individual convinced Melvien to set out for Kamihr Drifts?${prompt};
Of course, it would have to be someone with a wealth of knowledge...knowledge about new materials...effective pioneering logistics rrroutes...something that would surely pique the minister of finance's curiosity.${prompt};
So who could that be?${prompt};
Maester Margret of the Scouts' Coalition! There can be no other!${prompt};
Is that an accusation?${prompt};
You haven't established a motive.${prompt};
Oh, you had a motive.${prompt};
...Do share.${prompt};
“The Great Expedition.”;
Yes, a colonization game developed based on authentic records.${prompt};
It was created ten-something years ago at one of Adoulin's most prestigious academies. Created by you, Margret.${prompt};
I understand Melvien often found himself engrossed in the particulars.${prompt};
His fondness for the game led him to take a distinct interest in the colonization effort, culminating in participating in a survey group in the hinterlands.${prompt};
The very same foray that ended in the demise of his beloved father.${prompt};
The tragedy shook Melvien to the core, and he was a changed man.${prompt};
He was egged on by one of his most trusted friends...and lost his family in the process.${prompt};
He never forgave you. When colonization recommenced, he saw the opportunity to exact revenge on the one who shattered his life.${prompt};
It would be a simple matter for an information broker such as you to catch wind of his plot. So you schemed to strike before you were taken down. As I've already established, you would experience little difficulty calling him out to Kamihr Drifts.${prompt};
Once you had done the deed, all you had to do was wait for the reports to come flooding in.${prompt};
And were you not in charge of inspecting the body? A few facts changed, a few details overlooked...and the truth would be relegated to shadow, with no one the wiser.${prompt};
How is the paint looking now, Maester?${prompt};
Our flawless investigation has uncovered the most heinous of motives.${prompt};
Unlike you, we deal in facts, not theoreticals.${prompt};
Now it's your turn. Care to defend yourself?${prompt};
No! I would never--${prompt};
Look at you squirm!${prompt};
My job here is done. The Peacekeepers' Coalition will take over from here.${prompt};
But the Couriers' Coalition has something to say first.${prompt};
Who's there?${prompt};
R-Reginald?${prompt};
I was the one to discover the body.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
While it was true the body appeared to have been intentionally hidden, the fatal blow was clearly dealt by an axe.${prompt};
You were there, ${name-player}. What happened?${prompt};
Who killed Melvien?;
${selection-lines};
Arciela.;
Margret.;
Reginald.;
Estienneux.;
The Ulbuka Wardens.;
Morimar.;
I did.${prompt};
...No. That can't be right.${prompt};
It's about time to give the right answer.${prompt};
The weight of expectations is becoming unbearable.${prompt};
...${prompt};
If you cannot answer, then I will. ${choice: 0}[A strange, well-built man/Morimar] dealt the killing blow.${prompt};
Beyond doubt.${prompt};
Aha. The man goes by the name “Morimar.”${prompt};
There were no bullets left in the chamber when the gun was discovered.${prompt};
Which leads us to one inevitable conclusion.${prompt};
To begin, the first shot was fired by Melvien.${prompt};
After a brief struggle, ${choice: 0}[the man/Morimar] retaliated from behind, deciding the fight in one swift strike.${prompt};
He then set the body down in a secluded place to make it seem he had fallen during a trek into the forest...${prompt};
...In order to prevent Adoulin from plunging into chaos.${prompt};
Mufeh.${prompt};
Y-yes?${prompt};
The tapestry you wove...${prompt};
...Comes apart when you realize Margret didn't inspect the body immediately. It would have been impossible for her to falsify a report if I found the body first.${prompt};
B-b-but--!${prompt};
We have bullets and axe wounds as evidence. Judging from that, Margret must be innocent.${prompt};
You can prattle on all you want about suspicions and motives, but our undeniable evidence contradicts you at every turn.${prompt};
And the murder weapon also absolved Estienneux of any wrongdoing.${prompt};
...I suppose it does.${prompt};
And as for you...${prompt};
Yes, uh...I...${prompt};
When you--or rather Margret--looked back on the game she created, she had one very valid criticism.${prompt};
“I didn't create enough pieces.”${prompt};
Ah, yes, the Great Expedition.${prompt};
Adding in pioneers certainly spices up the rules.${prompt};
Perhaps you were the piece she needed all along, ${name-player}.${prompt};
With that matter settled, I take my leave.${prompt};
The false charges against Margret have been dismissed. She is doubtlessly awaiting you at Sverdhried Hillock.${prompt};
Hellooo! We're here to claim that which is rightfully-wightfully ours!${prompt};
Hmmm...is it just me, or is there no one here? Were we supposed to use the service-wervice entrance?${prompt};
...And there are no raptor fights or anything.${prompt};
(Hmph. Boneheaded twerps found the guts to come here...right into our grasp.)${prompt};
And a grand welcome here to the bright lights and dazzling effects of the Dashing Dreamers' next show!${prompt};
Don't worry, my lovely Tarutaru friends. We'll let you do a special little number that'll leave your heads spinning!${prompt};
Yes, spinning...and whirling and twirling all the way to a cargo ship bound straight for the Middle Lands!${prompt};
Hungry for more? Then feast your eyes on this delicate contraption we've prepared especially for you!${prompt};
A-absolutaruly amazing! The cheap--she's moving!${prompt};
But...what's the look of murder in her eyes!?${prompt};
${name-player}! You've g-g-got to help us!${prompt};
U-ugh...these nobodies are all over us like a bad rash!${prompt};
Two black-nosed pimples marring my smooth, supple skin...${prompt};
W-we'll remember this, you talentless hacks! My gorgeous Big Mama--the most beautiful in the land--will come and give you what for!${prompt};
Celestin, we talked about this! My Sweet Mama is the prettiest lady in the land, not yours!${prompt};
Don't make me remind you of what happened the last time we...${prompt};
<Grumble> Here's your stupid doll. A Dashing Dreamer always pays his debts.${prompt};
And you wanted some meat for your grinder? Then let me throw in a little something else--but you need to lay off the fat.${prompt};
Oooh! A tasty treataru!${prompt};
What is... What is...!?${prompt};
Hahaha! A special ${item-singular: 0[2]}, made by yours truly! Hopefully you find it...palatable!${prompt};
Nooo!${prompt};
Celestin, we need to have a chat about how my Sweet Mama's lustrous mane has as much volume as that coming out your mama's nose...${prompt};
Fabioso, my Big Mama is a pop star supreme! Next to her, yours is as flat as a wooden board!${prompt};
Tuffle-Buffle...!${prompt};
${name-player}, he's got droopy-woopy eyes and they won't pop open!${prompt};
Aha! If I were ill, I know who I'd wantaru to take care of me--Svenja!${prompt};
Yes, that's it! To the Order of Janniston we go!${prompt};
I'll lug Tuffle-Buffle to her manse, so in the meantime...${prompt};
...you take care of the mannequin!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You are left utterly speechless.;
Hehehe! Life must be so difficult when your face looks like a dhalmel stomped on it.${prompt};
Now, to stuff these two into barrels and get them boarded for their fabulous journey.${prompt};
Boat heading for Nowheresville, population: two!${prompt};
And as for you--well, we only brought two barrels, so promise not to show your face around here anymore and we'll call it square.${prompt};
No one will ever find this stupid prop within the recesses of the nearby depository...${prompt};
You're after the Dashing Drrreamers?${prompt};
Funny, that. They waltzed into the coliseum clutching a couple of barrrels from the warehouse nearby.${prompt};
What on Vana'diel is going on in there? Firrrst Adoulin's famous duo sneaks in through the back, and now a Tarutaru hauls tail out of here drrragging another by his coattails?${prompt};
He flailed about like a madman, screeching something about Svenja and the Orrrder of Janniston.${prompt};
The Dashing Dreamers? Funny about that. The duo hauled a pairrr of squeaking barrels out the front door not two minutes ago.${prompt};
Something about a carrrgo vessel and just desserts... I don't get paid enough to pay much attention.${prompt};
I...I made it.;
Chalvava, I'm here to...pick up this day's shipment of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Always a pleasure, Cynthia. You can't begin to imagine what a help it is to have you come pick-wick them up so frequently. I've been running around like a chocobo with its head cut off ever since that explosion a while back, and the repairs sure have kept our hands full.${prompt};
Unfortunately, today's deed is done. Ygnas was here not half an hour ago to pick them up himself.${prompt};
Odd that you didn't pass-wass him on your way down here.${prompt};
Oh, not again...;
I've got to hurry back to the castle!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Fremilla was always a touch on the flighty side, but Cynthia's gotaru heaps of neuroses all her own.${prompt};
My, my, the waterways are abuzz with activity today!${prompt};
So, ${name-player}, tell me--to what do I owe the honor-wonor?${prompt};
Who would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Ygnas.;
Fremilla.;
Cynthia.${prompt};
Fremilla?${prompt};
Up until recentaruly, she was the one in charge of receiving the ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} that I delivered to the castle.${prompt};
But after Ygnas recovered, she was assigned to serve Arciela full time.${prompt};
Ah, so you knew that?${wait-36: 1};
Just between the two of us, I had pictured servants-wervants to have a stronger head on their shoulders, but it's a small miracle that Fremilla doesn't drown while drinking water.${prompt};
Although...I remember that time she had you running around as her ${choice-player-gender}[errand boy/errand girl], so there's obviously a calculating side to her.${prompt};
Wait--don't tell me she's at it again, taking advantage of your good graces-waces!${prompt};
Cynthia?${prompt};
You know, it wasn't terribly long ago that I was in charge-warge of the tomato shipments...${prompt};
But ever since that terrible incident with the anti-colonization forces and the explosion down here, I've had my hands full--and so she started to come down here to pick them up directaruly.${prompt};
In factaru, you just missed her.${prompt};
But Ygnas made his way down here firstaru, and took the vegetables back with him. That's bureaucracy for you--the right hand never knows what the left is doing.${prompt};
Ygnas?${prompt};
If you recall, his patronage is the very reason that the Civic Arboretum has grown and expanded to the flourishing gardens it is today.${prompt};
Naturally, I was concerned for Ygnas's health from both a personal and professional perspective, but to see him looking like that...well, now I see why he's been a staunch supportaru of our vegetables.${prompt};
Don't get me wrong: I'm elated that he's better and visiting regularly. It was a bit of a surprise, that's all.${prompt};
He seemed particularly concerned about the effects the explosion-wosion had on the arboretum's expansion and the growth of our crops.${prompt};
You're wondering how I can understand him?${prompt};
Well, he's not much for speaking-weaking, but body language can tell quite a lot if you're inclined to pay attention.${prompt};
And when you work around vegetables all day, your green thumb becomes good for more than just growing-wowing.${prompt};
It's a matter of watching with your eyes rather than listening with your ears.${prompt};
The princess was always espousing her philosophy of harmony with nature, and I like to think I'm doing my partaru.${prompt};
But I've babbled enough. My vegetables await!${prompt};
How are you, my pretties?;
Ygnas has already collected the day's shipment of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Assuming he is to deliver them to the kitchen, I'd wager he's back at the castle by now.${prompt};
I always seem to meet you in the strangest of places, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Does this mean...you also came here because you heard about the duel?${prompt};
The thing is, the guards aren't going to let you in unless you have express permission to enter.${prompt};
Wait, but why would you care about this duel in the first place? I can't imagine my brother's stake in this interests you at all.${prompt};
Could it be that you're concerned about the widening schism between supporters and detractors of the colonization initiative?${prompt};
What are you concerned about?;
${selection-lines};
The schism.;
Arciela's brother.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
Thank you for caring so much about Adoulin even though it isn't your homeland.${prompt};
Hey, why don't I bring you along as a guest? That way the guards can't raise any objections.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
I'm not completely convinced this isn't just lip service.${prompt};
Either way, though, I suppose it's the thought that counts.;
Why don't I bring you with me as a guest? That way the guards can't raise any objections.${prompt};
No unauthorized persons are allowed in the Watergarden Coliseum.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s with me. I hope you aren't implying that I would bring someone of ill repute into the coliseum.${prompt};
My deepest apologies, Princess! I was unaware that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was in your company.${prompt};
Please proceed. The duel should be starting any moment.${prompt};
Neither of you plan to back down, I assume?${prompt};
Why would I when this crrretin's the one at fault!?${prompt};
The only thing more ridiculous than that coat you call your fur is the way you twist facts regarding the colonization movement! How dare you spit in the face of the alliance's decision?${prompt};
Hrrrah!;
Hnnng...!;
Trrry this on for size!;
Ah...!;
Hahaha, this certainly is a heated battle.${prompt};
And now for the grrrand finale!;
As if I would fall for that twice!;
Do not underestimate the power latent in all runes!;
Grrraaaaaaaaaaaa!;
Urk!;
<Cough> <wheeze>;
What seems to be the matter? Cat got your tongue?${prompt};
I'll kill you...if it's the last thing I do...you pointy-eared frrreak of nature!${prompt};
It'd appear that Alaixion has the upper hand...but only to the unobserving eye. Note that he failed to mitigate any damage from her fire spell.${prompt};
He's in just as much pain as her, if not more.${prompt};
Well, now...;
It appears that the next blow shall be the deciding one.${prompt};
No... Don't!${prompt};
Hahhh...;
My conviction shall never...crrrumble!;
Taste the iron blade of justice, mongrel!;
Stop! Stop this very instant!;
Prrrincess...${prompt};
Please do not interfere, Princess! This is a city-sanctioned trial by combat!${prompt};
That's just...${prompt};
I'm afraid he's right, Arciela.${prompt};
They both swore to bear no grudge against the other. Everything's official.${prompt};
But...but why? It shouldn't have to come to this...${prompt};
Because this trrraitor spews seditious drivel from his gigantic lips, that's why!${prompt};
Our ancestors lived by the law of the land! They listened to its breezes, read the flow of its waters, and trrrod lightly upon its grasses.${prompt};
And they listened to the founder king when he forrrbade us from entering the jungle!${prompt};
Ikhi Askamot rrrecognizes the founder king's word as the truth that it is.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition, though, doesn't care as long as they can keep making their trrrinkets!${prompt};
Hmph. All I hear is the mewling of a powerless kitten held by its scruff.${prompt};
Say that again and I'll rrrip your eyes out, maggot!${prompt};
I find it cute that you geomancers use this supposed voice of nature to rationalize your fear of entering a little forest. Once Amchuchu's revolutionary invention is built, you won't need to set foot in the forest...and our harvests will triple in size to boot!${prompt};
Justifying your violation of the Ancient Pact with a mechanical trrrifle?${prompt};
You disgust me!${prompt};
What disgusts me is your willingness to let the city's population starve!${prompt};
Even a simpleton like you knows full well that no airships can travel over the continent.${prompt};
There is only so much trade we can do via watercraft!${prompt};
Stop this at once!${prompt};
See, Arciela? A trial by combat is the only thing that'll stem the tide.${prompt};
Or would you rather everyone's emotions boil over into a civil war that splits the capital in two?${prompt};
No, I don't want that in the least...${prompt};
Mufeh Hajrrha, Alaixion...${prompt};
Somewhere deep within your hearts, you two must know that this battle won't solve anything.${prompt};
Adoulin's assembly is the only body that has any power to decide the fate of the colonization initiative.${prompt};
No matter which one of you emerges victorious, it will have no impact on their decision whatsoever!${prompt};
I beg of you...stand down...${prompt};
Princess...;
All I wanted was to prrrotect the forest.${prompt};
That, and to honor the founder king's last worrrds.${prompt};
You've said it yourself, Arciela. We shouldn't do anything to destrrroy the continent.${prompt};
Of the Twelve Orders, eight support the movement while only four oppose it. That is an overwhelming majority in my book.${prompt};
Shut your trrrap!${prompt};
How do you explain the lack of Ygnas's prrresence at the assembly meetings, then? He's the one who started it all, yet won't even show up to defend himself!${prompt};
Uhm...well...you see...${prompt};
The rrrumors are all over town.${prompt};
What rumors?${prompt};
That he's incurred the wrrrath of the forest and is afraid to leave his bed chamber.${prompt};
What brazen impudence!${prompt};
Have you forgotten that Grand Chancellor Ygnas is a descendant of none other than the founder king?${prompt};
The monarch who founded this nation! The warrior who boldly strode into these unforgiving wilds and built a country from nothing. And that selfsame blood courses though Ygnas's veins!${prompt};
I will not suffer the besmirching of a name as great as his!${prompt};
You agree with me, Arciela, do you not?${prompt};
Princess...?${prompt};
At least prrromise us he'll appear at the next assembly!${prompt};
That seems like a reasonable request to me, Princess.${prompt};
I don't know...${prompt};
The colonization movement has drrrawn its final breath. The end is nigh. I knew the rumors were true!${prompt};
Stay your tongue!;
That is mere palaver and you know it!${prompt};
I'll...I'll try my best...to get him to attend.${prompt};
More importantly, you two shouldn't be fighting each other. You're both citizens of Adoulin, for the Goddess's sake!${prompt};
So, please...let's just forgive and forget.${prompt};
Fine...;
I withdrrraw at Arciela's behest.${prompt};
What of the outcome? A duel such as this requires a victor, a champion!${prompt};
Let me rrrephrase that for you, traitor.;
I lose, you win.${prompt};
Rrrejoice at your well-earned victory.${prompt};
...?${prompt};
Very well.;
I declare Alaixion the winner.;
Remember that you two may not fight over this issue anymore.${prompt};
Yeah, yeah, I rrrealize that.${prompt};
Arrrciela, do I have your word that Ygnas will attend the next meeting?${prompt};
Y...yes. You do.${prompt};
Purrrfect.;
I'm sure Ikhi Askamot will be delighted to hear this.${prompt};
Alright, fight's over!;
Everyone, out!${prompt};
You want to know about whataru?;
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} picked from deep within the jungle-wungle?${prompt};
We're endeavoring to raise some here in the arboretum, so we just started readying the seeds for plantaruing.${prompt};
You...you want one?${prompt};
I hate to be the harbinger-warbinger of bad news, but we already devoured them all. I can still taste the one I ate, too.${prompt};
You'd have to have had a triply-wiply effective Haste cast on you to make it in time. There's no way something that delicious will stay unsavored for long!${prompt};
...H-hey now, d-don't look at me like that.;
It's not like we stole them and disposed of the evidence-wevidence before the Peacekeepers' Coalition could arrive! We boughtaru them with our own hard-earned bayld!${prompt};
If you really want ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} that badly, I guess I can let you in on a little secretaru. I'd never go because even taking one step into the battlegrounds sends paralyzing shiver-wivers down my spine, but word has it that there are some trees left in Yahse Hunting Grounds.${prompt};
If you're truly a pioneer and a connoisseur of the fruitaru, its location shouldn't pose a problem to you whatsoever! Now, it's time to plant these beauties.${prompt};
The faintest of voices echoes off the corridor walls.${prompt};
An indistinct hum wafts through the door of the sluice gate.${prompt};
...It grows softer and softer until it is no longer audible.${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
“All hail the masterminds. ☆G☆I...”${prompt};
“...the masterminds. H☆☆I...”${prompt};
Two voices chanted the same phrase in a slightly unsynchronized manner as they faded into the distance.${prompt};
For whom do we toil?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Nothing happens.${prompt};
Enter.${prompt};
I don't recall seeing your face here before...${prompt};
I suppose it's not unheard of to get new recruits. Get going or the council will begin without you.${prompt};
Take heed, brrrethren!${prompt};
We cannot afford to bide our time any longer. The colonization movement is gaining momentum at a frrrightening pace.${prompt};
Its supporters disguise it as the herald of agrarian prrrosperity. In reality, however, it's naught but an excuse to justify the rrraping of the land.${prompt};
To wit, there was an incident a few days past where someone trrried to burn the forest to ashes!${prompt};
Speak you the truth?${prompt};
She does.;
Our glorious leader witnessed it with his own eyes. He says that the Peacekeepers' Coalition is currently on the case.${prompt};
These vermin are a disgrrrace to our continent! We cannot forgive their transgrrressions!${prompt};
And where there's one cockroach, thousands more sprrring from the woodwork!;
Ulbuka's jungle is vast, but it cannot last forever against this interminable infestation.${prompt};
They've already culled an irrecoverable amount of wildlife and uprrrooted most of the rare plants.${prompt};
And, to thrrrow salt in the jungle's wounds, they've begun rrrecruiting more pioneers from overseas!${prompt};
These “adventurers” have befouled not only the wilderness with their prrresence, but the Sacred City of Adoulin as well.${prompt};
Ulbuka is our motherland. She deserves better than to be accosted by complete strrrangers!${prompt};
These so-called adventurers do seem a bit too proficient at pioneering, that is for certain.${prompt};
Ever since they arrived, they have more than doubled the pace of the colonization movement. Word has spread that these ruffians have even managed to infiltrate Yorcia Weald's deepest recesses.${prompt};
Rrrecently, the Inventors' and Pioneers' coalitions have started working even more closely together.${prompt};
What's more, they've brought over some young prrrodigy from a foreign land who's overrunning the continent with inventions.${prompt};
They wave the banner of what they call prrrogress, saying these inventions will increase crop yields.${prompt};
What kind of progress rrreduces our woodlands to wastelands? Their hypocrrrisy makes me want to hack a hairball at every last one of them.${prompt};
You, there. What do you think?${prompt};
Do you truly think rrravaging the forest will help feed Adoulin?${prompt};
What do you think?;
${selection-lines};
It could increase crops threefold!;
Of course it won't help.${prompt};
That was a rrrhetorical question.;
You're supposed to answer the way I want you to.${prompt};
Wait a minute...I don't think I've ever seen your face arrround here.${prompt};
How do you cover your tracks?;
${selection-lines};
S-sorry, I'm new.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
If you're new, then our secret code should still be frrresh in your mind. So, what is it?${prompt};
...${prompt};
That's rrright.${prompt};
I'm sorry I doubted you. Blame it on my skeptical purrrsonality.${prompt};
We have a spy among us! Off with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] head!${prompt};
You somehow manage to escape from the impromptu lair...${prompt};
Nothing of note happens.${prompt};
The congregation has already dispersed...${prompt};
Markings on the desk's surface mirror the message scrawled on whatever paper was laid upon it beforehand.${prompt};
You struggle to piece together what the markings say.${prompt};
It reads, “We strike during the dead of night. You know what to do once inside the castle.”${prompt};
You take note of what you have just learned.${prompt};
You're damn rrright it won't!${prompt};
There's no possible way a plan that contrrradicts the founder king's will would go smoothly.${prompt};
Indeed.${prompt};
We must prrreserve the forests at all costs, for the sake of the continent and for the founder king.${prompt};
I repeat...${prompt};
We have little time left!;
Arciela promised that her brrrother Ygnas would make an appearance at the next assembly.${prompt};
Were that to happen, support for the colonization initiative would flourrrish.${prompt};
We must act before Ygnas and the pioneers can trrrample Ulbuka's wilderness underfoot!${prompt};
Arciela, however, often calls for the colonization movement to take on a more rrreserved form. She is sympathetic to our cause.${prompt};
That is why, though it may take time, I believe we can convince her to lead us into the new errra.${prompt};
To make that easier, Ygnas must be rrremoved from his position as the head of Adoulin's most prominent order.${prompt};
...For all eternity.${prompt};
We shall uphold the will of the founder king and rrrestore Adoulin to its former glory!${prompt};
We strrrike during the dead of night!;
Give us your blood, your sweat, and your tears so that Adoulin may be rrreborn!${prompt};
Welcome to the Arboretum-wetum!${prompt};
It's so rare to see someone in this neck of the wataruways. What brings you down here?${prompt};
What's that?;
From the Middle-widdle Lands, you say? And you want to help with the colonization effortaru?${prompt};
Thank you so much! What a kind heartaru you have.${prompt};
What do we do here? We raise-waise vegetables, that's what!${prompt};
Did you know that all the water here is pumped up from deep below the island's surface-wurface?${prompt};
Then it goes around and around and around an intricataru reticulation of tunnels. Maybe the tunnels' design would be more logical-wogical if they weren't built two hundred years ago, but the geomancers back then did a good job with what they were given.${prompt};
Anyhow, we use some of the water and this spotaru to grow our vegetables.${prompt};
To let you in on a little secretaru, the alliance's most important person lends us his aid every so often.${prompt};
Exactly. None other than Ygnas S. Adoulin.;
He says that a place like this is needed not only to provision the colonization movement, but to help make the city self-sufficientaru.${prompt};
Sadly, he's been feeling under the weather for a while. I can hardly remember-wember the last time I saw him...${prompt};
Lots of people criticize Ygnas's decision to colonize Ulbuka, saying he's gone too far. Everyone here, though, stands tall and proud in supportaru of him!${prompt};
Sorry, but it's not too appetizing-wappetizing, is it?${prompt};
The Inventarus' Coalition was nice enough to develop a water purification system for us...${prompt};
But even with that, it's still rather dirty-wirty. Plus, the lack of light down here means the plants often don't get enough nutrientarus.${prompt};
There's no denying that they fill your stomach to the brim, though. You won't find fresh produce at a cheaper price anywhere in Adoulin, either.${prompt};
Oooh, over here! These Adoulinian tomatoes look positively scrumptious-wumptious!${prompt};
Incidentaruly, let me tell you a little something about Arciela.${prompt};
You do know her, right?${prompt};
By the way you talk, it sounds like you're bestaru friends. How'd you get to be so close to her?${prompt};
Never mind.;
Well, Arciela trekked all around the jungle-wungle just to pick up some tomato sproutlings for us! They truly are amazing specimens, for I've never seen any plant more resistantaru to disease.${prompt};
I still reminisce sometimes about the time I told her, “It'd be my pleasure-weasure to give you the first harvestaru!”${prompt};
Why? Because her smile was positively angelic! I feltaru as if I had gazed upon the countenance of the Goddess herself.${prompt};
Aha, I do believe that inspiration-wation has struck!${prompt};
If you're on such good terms with the princess-wincess, why don't you take today's batch to her?${prompt};
Just tell her they're from Chalvava and she's sure to acceptaru.${prompt};
You don't mind-wind, do you?${prompt};
See, the amountaru of work I have left is absolutely staggering.${prompt};
While I would rather do it myself, I guess I'll have to let you steal the spotlightaru.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Deliver the goods!;
Chalvavacate the premises.${prompt};
Aw, come on. It'd be the perfectaru chance to meet the princess.${prompt};
Welcome back!;
You feel like carrying-warrying this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Arciela now?${prompt};
Thank you!;
You're an invaluable-waluable help!${prompt};
Here you go.;
Don't you dare drop these, or the ghosts of us crestfallen researchers will hauntaru you even into the afterlife!${prompt};
Thanks for offering to deliver those tomatoes.;
Don't you dare drop them, though, or the ghosts of us crestfallen researchers will hauntaru you even into the afterlife!${prompt};
The wooden box contains ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Perhaps the wisest approach would be to search for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} with which to open the decrepit sluice gate.${prompt};
It appears to be an old sluice gate.${prompt};
...It looks like an old sluice gate, but...something's different.${prompt};
...If I recall correctly, the first ones were hand-operated. I bet we could get it to open if we had ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I once heard that the researchers down here were tidy enough to put leftover parts in crates and boxes. If we're going to find that thing, it's probably going to be in a box.${prompt};
I know, ${name-player}!;
Maybe we can open it with that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Well, well, well. If it isn't Arciela.${prompt};
...With ${name-player} right on her heels.${prompt};
I thought Mistdagger was better than to be followed by those from outside the profession.${prompt};
I know you're against the colonization movement, and I completely understand why you would be.${prompt};
Still, that's no reason to kill my brother!${prompt};
I think the will of the founder king is more than enough reason.${prompt};
The founder king would never condone the assassination of someone simply for expressing a different opinion from his!${prompt};
If you're so convinced of that, how about proving it on the battlefield?${prompt};
...You have thoroughly and utterly bested me. Do what you see fit with my living corpse.${prompt};
I'm not at liberty to make that decision. Your fate will be decided in accordance with the law.${prompt};
More importantly, though, I shouldn't be wasting my time fighting another Adoulinian in the first place.${prompt};
...Oh?${prompt};
I can't hide the truth any longer. I need to think of something before word gets out.${prompt};
I'm going to need your help as well, ${name-player}. Meet me in my brother's chambers as soon as you can.${prompt};
Enter the secret hideout?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Leave the secret hideout?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
The air in this subterranean-wanean slaughterhouse hangs heavy...much as your head will when the Zurk's through with you! Oh, how his blade will feasty-weast upon the blood of the fallen this eve!${prompt};
H-hello darkness, my old companion-wanion...the Zurk's come to weep with you again.${prompt};
Sorry to keep you waiting. I thought you might want a moment alone with your pride before I strip it from you.${prompt};
Sorry to keep you w...;
Aha. Back for another beating, I see.;
Too bad for you that no one in this age can defeat me.${prompt};
Let's dispense with the niceties. My sword needs to sing!${prompt};
How do you like me now?${prompt};
So, apparently you do know a bit about the runic arts. Who'd have thought?${prompt};
That one's going to sting in the morning!${prompt};
Urk...;
Good shot, but I won't go down that easily!${prompt};
Enough! Enough, I say!;
I submit. You've proven beyond doubt that you're the stronger swordsman.${prompt};
How's that crow taste?;
Raw and simple, just like your fighting style?${prompt};
...So that's how it's gonna be.;
Well, no more holding back!${prompt};
I don't think I've ever fought against someone as strong as you. I can't even pretend that it was close...you splattered my dignity across the whole Coliseum.${prompt};
What a match. You were great out there.${prompt};
Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.;
I'm Sverdhried's great-great-great-great-great-...${prompt};
I don't know how many “greats” it is, but I'm his granddaughter. The name's Braga.${prompt};
We put budding rune fencers through this trial to see whether they have the potential to carry on the tradition my grandfather began generations ago.${prompt};
As Sverdhried's descendant, it's my duty to pass judgment upon those who undertake the trial. So it has been since the days of old.${prompt};
Well, now that you've passed, enjoy the new powers you've gained from this experience.${prompt};
I hope that sparring session was as fun for you as it was for me. I haven't fought that hard in years.;
Don't think it'll be so easy the next time, though!${prompt};
Calyces of Adoulinian tomatoes clutter the ground...${prompt};
Ska-bam!;
Jerra's the name, and trrransforming metals is my game.${prompt};
The best thing about prowling down here is the surrrplus of Adoulinian tomatoes. My fur's stained red with the juices of my countless victims, and my stomach feels almost as rrround as them.${prompt};
<Sniff><sniff>;
I smell burrrnt flesh. Is that...${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Hm? You rrrequest a special sword?;
I'm not an accomplished enough blacksmith to prrrovide you with one...${prompt};
But I'm an expurrrt weaver of yarns!${prompt};
One interesting tidbit is that Yesty's kinder than a kitten, despite his tiger-like frrront.;
Anything else you want to hear?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Ask about swords.;
Listen to her stories.;
Leave immediately.${prompt};
Don't think you can rrrun away without hearing my stories!${prompt};
Well, the other week these incrrredible materials arrived at the coalition. We invented so many amazing things with them, I was kneading in joy.${prompt};
Our maester said we did the best job of any team, too. That day was so grrreat!${prompt};
Oh, and Yesty's a real sorcerer with rrrhodium!${prompt};
The way he thrrrows his whole body into beating that metal so hard...it's entrrrancing.;
Sometimes he lets me morph his prrrojects with alchemical powers before touching them.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Ask about swords.;
Listen to even more.;
Run like the wind.${prompt};
Did you know that Yesty has a rrregular customer?;
He's a rune fiddler or something. It's some difficult name I can't rrremember.${prompt};
The guy said he needed it for a big fight with a scary beast as part of a trrrial.;
The “Ides of Trrreason”? No, it wasn't that because he went into the woods instead of the waterways.${prompt};
But anyway, he didn't come back!;
The town sent a search party for him, but all they found was the tip of his rhodium sword and a piece of shrrredded chain mail!${prompt};
Yesty hasn't crrrafted a single thing since then. That's when he got all grrrumpy and stopped making stuff, too! Now our team's thrrreatening to slink off with our tails between our legs! It's depressing.${prompt};
At least I get to eat all these Adoulinian tomatoes now! If I can't satisfy my idle hands, I might as well satisfy my stomach.${prompt};
They're so grrratifying, you won't want to eat anything else...ever!${prompt};
What about them?;
Are you interrrested in the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} or ${keyitem-plural: 2[2]}?${prompt};
Which are you interested in?;
${selection-lines};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.;
None. I want out.${prompt};
Any alchemist with half a brrrain can make that! All you need is ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, so it's simpler than trrrapping vermin.${prompt};
...Oh, or ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}!;
You can furrrnish me with ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} if you don't have ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt};
How much easier can it get? Either of those for ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Ooh, ooh, I know this one! The answerrr is...${unknown: 0x010537828D8280}!;
There's a red rrrock near some glowing orange stuff. Heat it up, then when it's about to melt, frrreeze it with ${keyitem-article: 5[2]}.${prompt};
What about the red rock? It's red and hard!;
Hmmm...well, it doesn't shine very brrrightly, and you can't really use fiery attacks on it.${prompt};
Think blazes, flames, fire! That's how you'll rrremember it.;
If you ever want to get your paws wet, I'll give you ${keyitem-article: 5[2]}, but it's extrrremely cold.${prompt};
Don't drink it unless you want the coldest hairball ever to form in your throat and suffocate you.${prompt};
Why're you asking me if you have one!? There's no fun in telling people what they alrrready know.${prompt};
Heat up a red rrrock near some glowing orange stuff in ${unknown: 0x010537828D8280}. Then, when it's about to melt, frrreeze it with ${keyitem-article: 5[2]}.${prompt};
What about the red rock? It's red and hard!;
Hmmm...well, it doesn't shine very brrrightly, and you can't really use fiery attacks on it.${prompt};
Yesty once told me, “Never give a sword to a man who can't dancey-wance,” so let me purrrform a step or two to prove you can trust me.${prompt};
Ka-boom!;
I hope my glorrrious moves didn't blind you.${prompt};
Yes, this will do nicely.;
Now, let the cerrremony commence!${prompt};
Here you go, like I prrromised.;
I think this good deed deserves a pet on the head. Don't rrrub me the wrong way, though, or...you'll regret it!${prompt};
What's this drrreg of an object?;
I can't do anything with it whatsoever.${prompt};
How nice of you to scrrrounge all these up for me!${prompt};
I only need one, though.;
Maybe you should purrrk your ears up and listen better next time.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Jerra Ndala stares at you intently.;
${color-alt: 15}Jerra Ndala's staring becomes exceedingly absurd.;
Bleeech!;
For a rune fencer with ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you sure wear some unappealing rrrags.${prompt};
My mentor loves to strrroke his ego by making swords, but he tends to forget that clothes make the Mithra.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
This calls for the adrrroitness, the cunning, the finesse of the one and only Jerra!${prompt};
Why don't I craft you some new armor in exchange for the materials and some bayld? It sounds like a fair trrrade to me, so how about it?${prompt};
Is it a fair trade?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please craft me some clothes.;
No. You really need bayld?;
Maybe, but I don't need anything.${prompt};
Hmph.;
Fine. See if I care, jerrrk.${prompt};
Are you implying that an artisan like me should give my work away for frrree?${prompt};
Well, I like you, so I might. However, Yesty made me purrromise to always get paid for everything I do.${prompt};
Then, when he found out I was asking for tomatoes, he made me promise again to only accept “prrroper remunerations.”${prompt};
If one purrrson in the Inventors' Coalition asks for less, they'll get all the work and everyone else will have to lower their rates and we'll all go brrroke, he said.${prompt};
I'll crrraft you some rune fencery clothes for the materials and some bayld. Does that sound like a fair trrrade?${prompt};
How can I rrrefuse when you say the magic word?${prompt};
Before I start, you'll need to tell me what exactly you want me to crrreate.${prompt};
Which piece of equipment?;
${selection-lines};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
Why ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}?;
I know what I need.;
Let me think on it.${prompt};
No prrroblem. I'll just munch on a tomato in the meantime.${prompt};
Oooh, what ${choice: 4}[an attrrractive/a brrreathtaking/a surprrrising] choice!${prompt};
For that, you'll need...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]}...${prompt};
...two ${item-plural: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}...${prompt};
...aaand ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
...Huh?${prompt};
It's...well...uhhh...a trade secret!;
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to prrry into a Mithra's affairs?${prompt};
The most prrressing matter is the materials, so worry about those. You can always pay me later.${prompt};
After you rrround up the materials, just trade them to me and I'll work my magic! Good luck!${prompt};
Still interested in that purrrty armor, eh? Well, do you need to know how to make each piece?${prompt};
Purrrfect!${prompt};
You've brrrought me everything I asked for!${prompt};
Now to fulfill my part of the bargain and prrrepare some equipment! I'll even get Yesty to help.${prompt};
Here's what Yesty calls a “prrroof of order.” He won't let me give you anything I make without one, so don't lose it!${prompt};
A note scrawled in barely legible handwriting rests upon the floor.${prompt};
“${number: 0} bayld!”${prompt};
Look what I have for you! ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}! That'll be ${number: 1} bayld.${prompt};
Accept it? (Bayld: ${number: 2});
${selection-lines};
Yes, I'll pay the ${number: 1} bayld.;
Not yet.${prompt};
I'll just put it on rrreserve for you, then.${prompt};
Don't wait too long, though! I can't promise I won't get tomato all over this one, too.${prompt};
Hey, that's not enough bayld. Are you trying to make the Inventors' Coalition go brrroke?${prompt};
Your bag is already bursting at the seams...${prompt};
Here, eat it while it's hot!;
Wait, don't do that! You'll get violently ill. I know because I've trrried before.${prompt};
Did you know this bandeau is temperrred with poison?${prompt};
Don't get your fur all in a clump over nothing! It doesn't pose any thrrreat.${prompt};
In fact, it actually heightens your concentrrration.${prompt};
Those mitons help you purrrform Gambit with ease, you know.${prompt};
I don't know why, but that's how the trail cookie crrrumbles. Maybe it's the technique I use to sew with ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Apparently a grrreat maester or someone at the Inventors' Coalition developed it. Amazing, right?${prompt};
Wearrring these boots makes you feel lighter than if you had none on at all!${prompt};
It's all in how you use the ${item-plural: 1[2]} you're given. They can change equipment attrrributes depending on the weaver's skills.${prompt};
If Yesty had made these with me, they'd be so light you'd lift yalms into the air! That's no rrruse, either!${prompt};
I'd forgotten how much fun this can be! Next time you want me to make something for you, just drrrop by!${prompt};
I'm much more prrroficient at this now that I've made my second piece of equipment, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
If I've alrrready made two, that must mean there's one more to go. Just drrrop on by when you want me to make it!${prompt};
Well, that's the last of it. The amazing Jerra has successfully crafted you a full set.;
I'm grrreat, aren't I?${prompt};
I wove my fur, whiskers, and hairballs into that outfit for you, so you better apprrreciate it, okay?${prompt};
Handed over key item: ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} rings out across the land, somehow resonating with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and causing it to evolve.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has reclaimed its lost power, and your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} silently crumbles to dust.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} is bestowed with an incredible amount of runic energy, causing it to take on a more puissant form.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} has reached the pinnacle of its evolution.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} decomposes instantly and is carried by the winds to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt};
You feel an ever-so-faint sense that a rune with ${choice: 0}[frigid/bright/transient] properties lies nearby.${prompt};
You scribbled down some information regarding ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You have obtained new information regarding your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Strange visions flood into your mind!${prompt};
Fragments of shattered memories wedge themselves into your skull.${prompt};
Well, my goodness-woodness! Been quite a while since I've last seen you down here, ${name-player}!${prompt};
You're looking for some tomatoes? Funny, that. Someone from the castle asked for a shipmentaru, and when I replied that we had our hands full with the harvest, they said that they'd send someone. Is that someone you?${prompt};
No? But...one of the maids sent you?;
Hehehe, she pulled a fastaru one!${prompt};
Well, who takes them off my hands-wands is of no concern to me as long as they reach the castle safely. Let me just go...${prompt};
What's this, then?${prompt};
<Heave> <pant>${prompt};
My...my legs...;
Why'd I haul my keister down here? Without an...escort or anything...?${prompt};
It must be...because Grennith has her...eyes on me...${prompt};
Phew! Got the wind back in my sails.;
Sorry to keep you waiting--it's me, Fremilla from Castle Adoulin!${prompt};
Of course you are. So what brings you down to the Arboretum? Did your superiors find out you forced this pioneer-weer to do your dirty work?${prompt};
I-I...<gulp>${prompt};
You're, well...half right.${prompt};
Sorry, ${name-player}! I didn't mean any harm by it!${prompt};
And just what do you mean by “half rightaru”?${prompt};
Yes! Well!;
Arciela personally told me to come down here and tell ${name-player} that there's something she'd like to share with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt};
And there you have it.;
Oh--the tomatoes! Fear not, the, uh...sensational Fremilla will take it upon herself to see they arrive safely at the castle.${prompt};
Wasn't that your job-wob to begin with?${prompt};
Urk...${prompt};
S-so, hut-tut, ${name-player}! The princess is waiting for you!${prompt};
I'd give anything for the princess to trust me like she does ${name-player} and Grennith...${prompt};
But sitting here moping and muttering doesn't do anyone any favors!${prompt};
You'll see! I'll become the best maidservant Adoulin has ever seen!${prompt};
If that's truly what you desire-wire, then the first step is to not shove your work onto others!${prompt};
You've a sharp tongue, Chalvava. Your words are like knives!${prompt};
But...maybe it was my fault after all.${prompt};
Stop dwelling on what happened and learn-wearn from it. You're a good kid, Fremilla.;
Here.${prompt};
We all want to see the city thrive and prosper. You have your own role to play, as do I and every other man and woman this side of Jorius Yett.${prompt};
You're...right, of course.${prompt};
And take some pride in your work!${prompt};
G-got it!${prompt};
I'd sure love to have a tit-for-tataru with you, but Arciela awaits in the castle!;
As for the tomatoes, take heart--I've already sent Fremilla ahead with them.${prompt};
A quick glance reveals spoiled water trickling from upstream, likely caused by effluvium from the recent destruction.${prompt};
Pristine waters flow forth.${prompt};
So I was just here, mindin' my own business, see? Then all of a sudden, a huge flash of light, and boom! I darn near soiled m'self!${prompt};
Th' area's gone a bit foul, and I'm 'fraid it'll take a while 'fore things're back to normal.${prompt};
But boy, take a gander at this! It's part of a wooden fuse, wouldn't ya say? How crazy would ya hafta be to try to blow up the waterways!?${prompt};
The waterways're vital to all who live in Adoulin, so don't be thinkin' 'bout causin' no trouble!${prompt};
I wouldn't expectaru a philistine of the construction arts to notice, but a veteran like me can detect even the slightest change in the water. The recent shaking definitely caused a stir.${prompt};
One of my colleagues reportarued hearing a loud crack, like a bomb going off.;
Hmm...${wait-36: 1};
Yes, I imagine that would put us in a bit of a pickle-wickle.${prompt};
It's all we can do to even find the source. Repairing it? Bah, you'd better hope those pioneers're good for more than just traipsing-waipsing in the jungle!${prompt};
What would one of your ilk-wilk want down here? Only authorized workers are allowed beyond this point.${prompt};
Well, there's no mistaking it...${prompt};
This is the founder king's sepulcher.${prompt};
What's this?${prompt};
I think Ortharsyne's reacting to that monument in the center...${prompt};
I didn't expect you to get here so easily.${prompt};
I figured no one'd find me blending into the backdrop, but it looks like you pulled back the drape on my ruse.♪${prompt};
Balamor!${prompt};
What's wrong, pretty, pretty princess? You've come down with a terrible case of mean face since we last met.${prompt};
Although I won't be reciting any paeans either, thanks to your arrival. This wasn't in the script at all!${prompt};
I made it so that you'd have to struggle mightily through each act, and then break a leg...literally!${prompt};
I suppose you managed to get here because of that ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]?${prompt};
Exactly!;
I'm not alone in this fight anymore, and that's how I know we'll beat you!${prompt};
Bweeheehee!${prompt};
My mistake. I'd typecast you as a delicate flower, but we'll see how well you audition for the role of stalwart crusader!${prompt};
Things are finally starting to get interesting!${prompt};
I think I've taken a liking to you two.${prompt};
Though the waterways have many intriguing sights, I'd say this guy right here gets top bill.${prompt};
Once the forces here reverse completely, that's when the show will really start.${prompt};
What're you babbling about!?${prompt};
Never mind.${prompt};
Sometimes you just can't wait for opening night.${prompt};
Tee hee hee, the director never said I couldn't interact with members of the audience. You don't mind joining me on stage for a bit, do you?${prompt};
Then it's decided! We'll have simply the best time ever!${prompt};
At first glance, this looks like any old doll rummaged from some musty old attic chest. But when I do this...${prompt};
If you're happy and you know it...♪${prompt};
Clap your hands!;
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!♪;
What a twist! Now she's got a whole supporting cast!${prompt};
As an aside, you know that collecting statue parts has gotten popular lately, right?${prompt};
That whole thing was my idea.${prompt};
What were they called again? Otherworldly skedaddles? I don't know, making them was just a passing fancy.;
But let's relive those fond memories!${prompt};
Still, I don't want to bore myself to death waiting for you to slog through everything.${prompt};
I know! I'll pull some strings and make it one act long!${prompt};
On that note, let's end this game of hide-and-seek...${prompt};
And embark on a scavenger hunt!${prompt};
Ready, set, go!♪;
Where'd they go!?${prompt};
I had them possess a bunch of different monsters throughout these waterways.${prompt};
When you're done slaying beasts and getting parts, look for the black twitherym to enter my theatre of war. Then, once you've taken center stage, use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to find me.${prompt};
Enjoy the show!;
Oh, and don't let me down!${prompt};
Wait!${prompt};
Byoohoohoohoo!;
It looks like we've no choice but to go chasing after those simulacra, ${name-player}. Let's go!${prompt};
To think I, the great Balamor, would be upstaged by two understudies...${prompt};
I won't sit back and let you poke holes in my plot!${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
......${wait-36: 2};
.........Wait.${prompt};
Aha, my muse has struck!;
Who knew that this power was holding me back the whole time?${prompt};
Bweheeheehee.;
So, this is the true curse...?;
Oh, Director, you're such a character.${prompt};
Who're you talking about!?${prompt};
Arciela, you're like a child who wanders into the middle of a production and distracts the audience with stupid questions.${prompt};
There's nothing more maddening than listening to someone ask a question they already know the answer to.${prompt};
Why don't you answer for me?${prompt};
Who is Balamor's master?;
${selection-lines};
Hades.;
Teodor.;
Arciela.${prompt};
Wow, let's give the adventurer a round of applause for knowing the obvious!${prompt};
Hades is my master indeed.${prompt};
Ring-a-ling-a-ding-dong, let's all sing along because you're wrong!${prompt};
I don't even know who that is.;
Did all that running behind the scenes make you forget the name of the main antagonist?${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
Hahahahahaha!${prompt};
If only that were true! What an unexpected turn of events it'd be.;
You're even better than me at clowning around.${prompt};
It all makes sense now!${prompt};
See? Not an onz of surprise.${prompt};
How utterly boring.${prompt};
I think it's time I gave this role the hook.${prompt};
...But wait!${prompt};
Gwahahaha. I think I know how to add some conflict to this otherwise stilted script.${prompt};
Yes, Balamor, you're a dramatic genius who's ahead of his time.♪${prompt};
Hmmm, is this it?;
Or maybe this? Hm hm-hm♪${prompt};
What in the name of...?${prompt};
...Oho, there it is.♪${prompt};
And now for something completely different...${prompt};
Pain, pain, go away.♪${prompt};
Come again another day!☆;
Aaaaaand that's a wrap.${prompt};
...What?${prompt};
It wouldn't be any fun if I explained it, now would it? Let's just say that I returned something to its rightful place.${prompt};
All we can do now is wait for “time to tell.”${prompt};
Anyway, my days as a member of this troupe of terror are over.${prompt};
It was a pleasure doing battle with you, but from now on I'll be watching this Grand Guignol go up in flames from the gallery.${prompt};
What about removing the curse like you promised!?${prompt};
Oh yeeeah, I forgot the curse.${prompt};
But I never said I'd remove it.${prompt};
How dare you!${prompt};
Tee hee hee, why so serious? It's just a harmless jape.${prompt};
Of course I'll help you out. After all, the higher you prop them up, the harder they fall!${prompt};
If I robbed the people of hope, no one would despair when the world comes crashing down.${prompt};
Leave some scraps of hope, however, and the populace fights over them like mongrels.${prompt};
Hee hee, I can hardly contain myself thinking what face you'll make when you hear this.${prompt};
But listen carefully. I only give stage directions once.${prompt};
To remove the curse, you'll have to...dethrone Hades.${prompt};
Defeat Hades!?${prompt};
Yes! To think that you beat out all the other contenders for this coveted part! You must be so proud.${prompt};
But will our two intrepid explorers be able to overthrow the unhallowed king?${prompt};
Will someone else steal their limelight before they even arrive at Ra'Kaznar Turris? I know I'll have a lorgnette squished to my face in anticipation.♪${prompt};
Ra'Kaznar Turris...${prompt};
There is a tower within the deepest part of what you call the Serpentine Labyrinth. It is there the master resides.${prompt};
Those who heeded his call and swore allegiance to his cause will soon awaken. The stage is set, and a crowd has gathered.${prompt};
If you're going to die, you might as well make a spectacle of it. I know I'll shiver with joy at every cry of pain and crunch of bone.${prompt};
However, if you do manage to triumph, it'll be nothing short of deus ex machina.${prompt};
Either way, it should be a performance of a lifetime. I can't wait to see how it plays out.;
Enjoy your intermission while it lasts!♪${prompt};
We have to take down Melvien--or should I say Hades?${prompt};
Whichever it is, how can we succeed where even the founder king failed?${prompt};
How will you succeed?;
${selection-lines};
With teamwork, that's how!;
Where there's a will, there's a way!${prompt};
You're right. We can't give up!;
You've always been there to point me in the right direction, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I promised I'd stop brooding, and it's high time I practiced what I preach!${prompt};
That subterranean sovereign will want to seal himself away when we're through with him!${prompt};
Tell me...;
The stars in the sky. What do you think they are?${prompt};
They dot the black sky, providing thousands of little lights to shine down on a cold winter's eve...but in reality, they are each separate worlds, not unlike our own.${prompt};
At least, that's what some sages so outlandishly claim.${prompt};
When you gaze up into the night, have you ever thought about how blessed you are that they exist?${prompt};
The winds may shift, the land may quake, and gods are born and die...but the stars remain forever unchanging.${prompt};
And during the day, when black waxes blue...have you ever pondered the glory of the daytime?${prompt};
Here we sit, underground, surrounded from top to bottom, left to right, by stone walls that block the sky from view.${prompt};
Yet the blue sky and starry night wait patiently for us to take but one step aboveground.${prompt};
You find that to be an unwavering truth, do you not?${prompt};
Would that life were that simple.${prompt};
No, what you take to be a given is not the case for others.${prompt};
Permit me to reminisce about the past before we duel--about the time I first met the entity you know as Hades.${prompt};
He was not always known by that name.${prompt};
And I was but a loyal follower. My memory beyond that time is hazy...but I do recall that much.${prompt};
He was a man of ambition, a man with a lust for power and influence.${prompt};
History talks of kings and emperors, of soldiers and generals, but their desires to leave their mark for future generations pale in comparison to his.${prompt};
He commanded huge swaths of the populace, his presence divine...and I, too, chose to follow in his path.${prompt};
I respected, adored...and envied him.${prompt};
In his search for a way to attain the unattainable, he found the truth.${prompt};
The truth of how to overcome his mortal shell and become something greater.${prompt};
Become more than human?${prompt};
He stepped beyond all boundaries known to man, and discovered a realm beyond our own.${prompt};
How do you react?;
${selection-lines};
A different realm?;
Discovered?${prompt};
Yes. He named it “Tartarus.”${prompt};
Yes. He called it “Tartarus”--an extra-dimensional space.${prompt};
That is also the approximate time he began referring to himself as “Hades.”${prompt};
Not content to merely discover a new land, he began to gather servants that would bend totally to his will.${prompt};
He was single-minded of purpose, and desired underlings to serve him unfalteringly.${prompt};
He called forth beings that had no right to be in this world...the Cimmerian Adherents.${prompt};
The other two members of the Xol Triumvirate were likewise summoned from that most unholy of domains. It is likely that Balamor was as well.${prompt};
How do I know all this? Because I ranked above all his other followers.${prompt};
Although as I turn my eye to the past, I realize that “minion” might be the more appropriate term.${prompt};
By his will I entered Tartarus, and it was there that I discovered them. It was by my hand that they were brought forth to Vana'diel.${prompt};
Teodor!? You did what!?${prompt};
Would that it were possible to deny it, but I will not shirk from speaking the truth.;
It was then that Hades began to change.${prompt};
What do you ask?;
${selection-lines};
How did he change?;
You discovered them?;
When was this?${prompt};
I know not what powers he obtained when he surpassed the confines of flesh, nor what “realities” he saw.${prompt};
The only clue I had was these cryptic words:${prompt};
“All are lost, their spirits wandering endlessly through the darkness. I will help them transcend their suffering. I will give them death, and all will become one.”${prompt};
It was my job, he remarked almost flippantly, to help him see his goals through. I felt tugged in all directions, but he invested in me a fraction of the energies he gathered from Tartarus.${prompt};
And so, I became the first of the Xol Triumvirate.${prompt};
Hades and I were not brought into this world as undying beings--we were human, just like the two of you.${prompt};
I was his follower--and he used me to further his own ends.${prompt};
I journeyed through the void of Tartarus, alone, and every demon I subjugated I made swear a vow to serve Hades.${prompt};
Ashrakk, Dhokmak, the Cimmerian Adherents...all of them are blasphemous entities from that sealed land.${prompt};
Yet not all capitulated easily. There were the six Naakuals, and Sajj'aka.${prompt};
They did not fully succumb to my tortures. Their oaths did not ring true to my lord, and he confined them deep within the shadowy realm.${prompt};
So they were left to fester...${prompt};
We were discussing the stars at the start of our conversation, ${name-player}, and that leads me into this next tale. Tartarus was a land without stars or blue skies. Though I cannot say it was a confined location, it was utterly sealed within itself.${prompt};
It was not wholly unlike these waterways--you can stretch your arms out above or below you, but are in the end blocked in.${prompt};
Our future was much the same.${prompt};
I could not tell you how many days and nights I spent wandering that black land.${prompt};
How pointless is it to count time in a world that knows neither dawn nor dusk? And how much more laughable does that become to one who does not age?${prompt};
It was an endless parade of bloodshed, with no respite in sight. I lost control of what made me human and succumbed to the darkness.${prompt};
That may have been the very reason he chose to send me to Tartarus.${prompt};
Despite his centuries of dormancy, his goal has remained firm and absolute.${prompt};
This brand, this blood sigil...it binds my soul to his, so his intentions are as clear as crystal to me.${prompt};
One's death should not be for another to decide. You may find such a truth to be self-evident, but at the time it did not occur to me.${prompt};
That's...${prompt};
I was like a zombie, mindlessly following Hades' orders...until I met August.${prompt};
If I had not seen that most noble visage, I might still be under the dread lord's thrall this very day.${prompt};
I would be without a will to call my own, content with blindly culling those who dared defy him.${prompt};
The only path left to me was one of darkness, shambling from battle to battle sans thought or pause.${prompt};
When my future had been locked into place by another, August came and released me from my prison.${prompt};
His face was a radiant beacon in the darkness, outshining even the scales of Sajj'aka himself.${prompt};
Of course, were I to tell our dragon friend, he would likely chew on my head as a snack.${prompt};
But the past is in the past, and we must now look toward Ulbuka's future.${prompt};
The only way to release the blood sigil is to sever my spirit from my body.${prompt};
August was aware of this as well, and it is why he showed no mercy in our combat.${prompt};
${name-player}, you${choice: 0}[/ and your comrades] must vanquish me. There is no other option.${prompt};
You must. As he did.${prompt};
Never would I have thought the same story would play out twice...${prompt};
...but despite what August showed me, our destinies are not fully in our own hands.${prompt};
Forgive me my divergent ramblings. You have a task to which you must attend.${prompt};
You stand no chance against Hades if you cannot fell even one such as me.${prompt};
Princess, I bid you to wait outside the ring.${prompt};
But never once avert your eyes, for it is your responsibility to witness this clash, and whatever end awaits.${prompt};
Of course.${prompt};
I will not hold back. Come, defenders of Ulbuka!${prompt};
So you have elected to come alone? Bravery worthy of August himself.${prompt};
This scene repeats itself...down to the last detail.${prompt};
Hahaha!;
Is that confidence or brashness I see in your eyes?${prompt};
Does it even matter in the end? Be aware, the years have taken nothing from me!${prompt};
I will not hold back. Come, defender of Ulbuka!${prompt};
Obscure etchings appear on your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
<Huff>;
Splendidly done, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Teodor!?${prompt};
Did you think my assertion of immortality to be hyperbolic?${prompt};
Lest you think I do not feel pain, I do. Though I cannot cross over, I have been at the brink several times--and it is not an experience I ever desire to repeat.${prompt};
And the closer I get, the worse it is.${prompt};
But my soul is free from his icy grip once more. With this, you should be able to slay him, once and for all.${prompt};
...Of course, saying such encouraging words only makes light of the situation, for his power is orders of magnitude greater than my own.${prompt};
Consider yourself duly warned.${prompt};
And with that, I bid you leave me to my thoughts.${prompt};
This conflict has worn me out.${prompt};
True, I may be unable to age...but I was old enough when I became that way. Leave a gentleman to his aches and pains.${prompt};
But make a salve for me before you go?;
Hahaha!${prompt};
Hehe! Oh, Teodor!${prompt};
Princess...${prompt};
Or rather, Arciela...;
You did your family proud, remaining steadfast in the face of such a violent struggle.${prompt};
Thank you.${prompt};
So this is what it feels like to be my own man...after all these years.${prompt};
And their “friend,” Balamor.${prompt};
That was quite the parting gift.${prompt};
If he was able to manipulate the blood sigils, then he may be more than just an ordinary member of the triumvirate.${prompt};
They best not underestimate one such as he.${prompt};
I can only hope...${prompt};
The three blood sigils begin to pulse a violent crimson!${prompt};
Ah, yes, my most adoring fan! If I weren't so tickled to see you I might call you a stalker.${prompt};
And to think that you've brought ${choice: 1}[your lovely princess/a fair maiden] along for front row seats!${prompt};
The same tired old soliloquy would seem so contrived now, wouldn't it?${prompt};
You must be that “Balamor” fiend lurking in Ceizak Battlegrounds! First the continent, now the city...what do you want with us!?${prompt};
Leave Adoulin and flee to whatever hole you crawled out of!${prompt};
My dear, you must have me mistaken for some two-bit hack.${prompt};
First the castle, now the waterways--what nefarious scheme have you hatched this time!?${prompt};
Leave Adoulin and return to the vile domain you came from!${prompt};
“Nefarious scheme”? Oh, my dearest Arciela, you are sorely mistaken. I'm having a grand old time just watching the scene play out.${prompt};
And besides, there's no wisdom in messing with your betters.${prompt};
And you should be thanking me! I've decided to stop trying to create a new world and save this one instead.${prompt};
Of course, I still plan to make myself the protagonist.${prompt};
And ${name-player}, there's much to be gained from joining hands and becoming part of my union.${prompt};
You would refuse my generous offer? After how much effort it took for me to come back from who-knows-what world?${prompt};
You came back from...another world? What are you on about?${prompt};
Hut-tut! You're not going to get me to show my hand that easily.;
Can't I bring just a little bit of humor and uncertainty into your lives?${prompt};
What's more, young one, it would take far too much energy to explain to you the tedious story of how ${name-player} and ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] pale-faced friend...what was his name? Celennia? Selbina? Selh'teus? Yes, Selh'teus. How ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] and Selh'teus ruined my week.${prompt};
And on the way back I had to hop from world to world, making discovery upon discovery, and I did my own little research as I went.${prompt};
Before each world fell in turn, that is.${prompt};
Whole worlds...falling? ${name-player}, what is he...?${prompt};
Not too far in the future, all the worlds I visited--and presumably those I didn't--will fall to a force known as the “Emptiness.”${prompt};
Even...even Vana'diel!?;
You mean you haven't heard? Bwehehe! Oh, that's a rich twist of events!${prompt};
And so, ${name-player}, I took a look at some of that essence I borrowed from your little orb.${prompt};
You see, I figured it could throw a wrench in the whole “Emptiness” business.${prompt};
But like any good drama, the conclusion I came to wasn't so simple.${prompt};
Your orb has, in fact, been filled with the power of light...${prompt};
Or would it be more accurate to say “the power of life”? Either way, it transcends the boundaries of time and space.${prompt};
And I must confess that although this may seem a bit of a tired trope, the gods themselves would be jealous of what you stumbled upon.${prompt};
As am I.${prompt};
And so I'd like to lend your orb a little bit of my power, if for no other reason than to see how far down this rabbit hole goes.${prompt};
But everything has a price. And my little surcharge would be for you to bring me an orb once wielded by your pretty princess's long-dead relative--the founder king.${prompt};
And don't mind me--I'll be over there taking a nap in the meantime.${prompt};
So come back when you've found it, and then we'll be on with the show!${prompt};
One of the founder king's relics? Here? Why would even I be unaware of this?${prompt};
And there's no way I'd entrust such an artifact to that two-faced jester.${prompt};
Is this...is this what fate has in store for us?${prompt};
Ah, I can see them...the memories of the times we shared together.${prompt};
I don't know why, but thinking about the journeys we ${choice: 1}[will have/had] brings me a sense of peace.${prompt};
${name-player}, I know now that the right thing to do is to entrust the founder king's artifact to you.${prompt};
But my position in the city is a delicate one, and I will pretend that I never heard of such an object. So, please--do with it what you will.${prompt};
Just please promise me that you will share any new information you glean from Balamor.${prompt};
It all began with a stone, or so the legend says.♪${prompt};
In ages past, a sentient jewel, enormous and beautiful, banished the darkness. Its many-colored light filled the world with life and brought forth mighty gods.♪${prompt};
What a quaint little ditty, wouldn't you say? And one which a Middle Lander such as yourself would have heard many times before.${prompt};
It began with a stone. A many-colored light banishing the darkness.${prompt};
But neither of us really thinks that the “darkness” is the Emptiness, hmm?${prompt};
It's the Void.${prompt};
And what threatens your lovely friend's future isn't the Emptiness either. Once again--it's the Void.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
“Void”?;
With a capital “V”?;
Meaning that there's nothing?${prompt};
Isn't it your job to put the pieces together? Because it's certainly not mine.${prompt};
Come now. Less standing around stupefied and more handing me the founder king's orb.${prompt};
Some thousand years ago, Adoulin's founder king, August, came across enormous magical power and sealed away ${choice: 0}[a near omnipotent being/Hades], who came to learn of a place called Tartarus.;
And the “enormous magical power” is central to how the story unfolds.${prompt};
And he came in contact with my homeland...the place where I was born.${prompt};
Yes, this orb...is from my world.${prompt};
Ah, yes...I remember so clearly now.${prompt};
We referred to the Void as the “Cloud of Darkness.”${prompt};
Ugh. How can I explain this to someone with your...erm...mental capacity?${prompt};
It's not alive. It's not dead. I don't know if it even “is.”${prompt};
It eats away at light and darkness, halting all life and making it as if it never existed to begin with. That is its purpose...if you can call it that.${prompt};
And what I learned is that my world, your Vana'diel, and the countless other stars that exist are but islands floating within this cloud.${prompt};
The cloud doesn't think or feel, but it does shift and move just like the clouds you and I are familiar with.${prompt};
With each blow of the wind it moves, grows, shrinks, and dissipates...and as it does, it engulfs any worlds that stand in its way.${prompt};
And if your world is unlucky enough to be caught in its path, then...poof!${prompt};
Not that I've had the ill fortune of seeing or experiencing it. But it was a little something I picked up along the way.${prompt};
Bwehehe!;
I couldn't care less whether you believe me or not. That's for you to decide.${prompt};
...But you probably should, especially now that your orb is filled with a little bit of me.${prompt};
What was it you called it? “Trust”? Even I couldn't come up with a more fitting name.${prompt};
Not that I have any idea how you came to manipulate such powers.${prompt};
But the fact that such a thing is possible...couldn't that be a sign She gave you?${prompt};
But I grow bored of this. Let me return what I've borrowed.${prompt};
Haven't you read the script? This is the part where you show me the orb!${prompt};
Sometimes the most unexpected of paths emerges from the most taxing of trials. Beauty incarnate, no?${prompt};
And so, ${name-player}, I take my leave. Perhaps we'll be fortunate enough to cross paths again someday!${prompt};
