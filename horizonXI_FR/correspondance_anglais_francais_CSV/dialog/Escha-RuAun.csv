Don't let your guard down for a second. This may look like the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, but it is not the one we know.${prompt};
Where are we?${prompt};
The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah...but not the one we know.${prompt};
Are you the one known as Zeid?${prompt};
That is right. And you must be Iroha--Aldo has told me much about you.${prompt};
I knew I had to investigate as soon as I heard something was amiss.${prompt};
The only color here is the color of death.${prompt};
This empty husk is void of anything that we could call nature.${prompt};
The first thing I noticed about this place is its striking resemblance to the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, located in northeastern Mindartia.${prompt};
Zi'Tah...yes, I have run across that name several times before.${prompt};
Yes, it was when the master first visited Reisenjima.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] said there was a sanctuary there, much like one in my homeland.${prompt};
Those chosen by the mothercrystal may enter a holy shrine deep within the Sanctuary to receive the protection of the Dawnmaidens.${prompt};
I had envisioned it to be more bursting with splendor...${prompt};
Its layout and features resemble Zi'Tah, of that there can be no doubt. Yet the magic and warmth are gone, like we are in a different world entirely.${prompt};
...Or is this the future?${prompt};
I do not believe so.${prompt};
If the coming Emptiness is to swallow the world, then I would be more inclined to believe that we are catching a glimpse of what that swallowed world would be like.${prompt};
Did you hear that?;
A...bell? But where...?${prompt};
Urk...;
Who goes there?;
Zeid${choice: 1}[/, Lion]! Please, stay with us!${prompt};
Something foul is afoot. The world blurred and I took leave of myself.${prompt};
You were under its thrall.${prompt};
It gives me chills just thinking about it.${prompt};
If the clamoring has ceased, then we may yet find respite.${prompt};
Master, this may be the world we refer to as “Escha.”${prompt};
I still have much to learn, but your words that day will always stay with me:${prompt};
“When the darkness first came, the Middle Lands were the first to be assaulted. Swaths of land were consumed, leaving a colorless landscape where life once thrived.${prompt};
“It marked the beginning of the end.”${prompt};
And that world, you said, was known as Escha.${prompt};
Yet the annals say that the Emptiness first started to appear many years hence.${prompt};
So why now? Why here?${prompt};
What if...history were being rewritten?${prompt};
It could be that my returning to your time has placed a stick in the wheel of fate.${prompt};
Has the darkness come with me?${prompt};
Though this may sound counterintuitive, I fear we must change the future if we are to save the past.${prompt};
You are right. That is rather difficult to wrap my head around.${prompt};
Iroha, is there no way to purge this “Escha” from our land?${prompt};
Would that I had the answers you seek.${prompt};
Then only one path lies open to us: figure out what we can for ourselves.${prompt};
As if this land were not dangerous enough, now we have that unholy bell to contend with.${prompt};
A perilous reality at best.${prompt};
Maybe we should return to the mothercrystal first.${prompt};
Have you any insight, Lion?${prompt};
Nothing but my gut. I can feel her...calling out to me.${prompt};
Lion? Wait!;
I know not what role she has to play, but her intimate bond with the future is beyond denial.${prompt};
Master, perhaps it would be best if we follow her.${prompt};
Master, perhaps Lion could provide us with the guidance that we so desperately require.${prompt};
Lion?${prompt};
My understanding is that none resonate with the mothercrystal more strongly than she.${prompt};
Your role in protecting our future is vital, Master, but Lion is of equal importance.${prompt};
She is with the crystal now, is she not?${prompt};
Then we must go. Hurry!${prompt};
Iroha? Wait!${prompt};
Light begins to shimmer and twist as you pass your hand over it.${prompt};
The blinding light obscures your vision of the world beyond.${prompt};
Your pinches of escha silt trigger a faint reaction in the light, granting a small glimpse of what lies beyond.${prompt};

Soon as I set foot in this place I knew I was in fer a treat, but boy, word spreads fast to these adventurer types...${prompt};
Urk... Me? I'm, uh...Affi. And what does an ugly mug like you call yerself?${prompt};
${name-player}? Bwahaha, a better adventurer's name I've never heard!${prompt};
Surely you know what the Tenshodo is, ${name-player}? Well, they sent me off to what was supposed to be this Goddessfersaken land...but there's far more coin to make out here than I've imagined.${prompt};
So loosen up your purse strings, because I've got sundries aplenty!${prompt};
Aye, I say “coin to make,” but that's a bit more metaphori-whatsit than physical. What I'm lookin' fer isn't gil, but a special substance known as “escha silt.”${prompt};
Dun' worry if you don't have any on you right now. Just go bash some skulls in over yonder, and you'll surely be able to...procure some from the corpses of the fallen.${prompt};
Oho! If it isn't my favorite adventurer. What can I do fer you today?${prompt};
Everything's got a price, my fine friend, most of all information. Grease my palms with ${number: 0} pinches of escha silt and we'll do business.${prompt};
A pleasure. A bloomin' pleasure.${prompt};
A bit big for our britches, aren't we? Then let me give you a little tip fer free--don't get killed.${prompt};
Hey now! I've gotta make sure I have enough ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} fer everyone. Only one per customer.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will run you ${number: 1} silt.${prompt};
What kinda dunce do you take me fer? That's not nearly enough silt!${prompt};
Always good doin' business with you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now don' get me wrong--I'm more'n happy to take that vorseal off you. Just don't come cryin' because its powers have faded away!${prompt};
And if you want it back, well...it'll cost you. Business is business.${prompt};
Wanna know which seals you've got on you? Hmm...let's see...${prompt};
Sounds 'bout right to me.${prompt};
If it's ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} yer wantin', I'll need ${number: 1} escha silt.${prompt};
There you go! A finer ${item-singular: 0[2]} you'll never see!${prompt};
This place? We've taken to callin' it “Escha,” but I'll be damned if I can remember who came up with the name.${prompt};
The color's really off-puttin', wouldn't you say? Even the ground sends shivers up my spine. I'd be haulin' keister back to Jeuno with my tail between my legs if there wasn't a good 'mount of profit to be made.${prompt};
Goes without sayin' that the danger's not limited to the terrible pall of the land. The further in you go, the more ferocious the beasts get.${prompt};
Not that I expect that to stop you. If there's one thin' I can count on an adventurer doin', it's wadin' into the unknown and comin' back with more'n one fresh scar.${prompt};
You'll also find some really weird shiny portals hangin' about. I've been takin' to calling 'em “eschan portals.”${prompt};
A little bit o' hand wavin' and a sprinklin' or two o' silt, and before you know it you'll find yerself somewhere else. Whether you find it convenient or not depends a bit on yer worldview.${prompt};
Maybe yer a bit queasy 'bout the whole thin', but I promise there's a fair chance you'll come out whole.${prompt};
'Sif I know how the blasted things work. I'm from the Tenshodo, not the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies!${prompt};
And don't think you can just hop 'round wherever. You can only go bouncin' between places you've been to already. Anythin' else'd be a bit too dangerous.${prompt};
Escha silt is a fine powder found all 'round here, and scholars and academics all throughout Vana'diel are just itchin' to get their claws on some.${prompt};
So it goes a lil' somethin' like this: You find the silt, and sell it to me for stuff. Then I go back to Jeuno and give it to droolin' researchers for a tidy sum. Win-win-win.${prompt};
Not that I know a whit 'bout why the stuff is so special. As long as they pay me for it, I don't care if they build little silt castles outta it.${prompt};
Escha beads, huh? Can't say I'm familiar with the particulars.${prompt};
What I do know is that the luckier among yer lot sometimes find them amongst monsters that've fallen in battle.${prompt};
But I do know a couple people who'd be interested in the stuff--one o' my comrades in Norg, fer instance.${prompt};
He's pretty versed in the ways o' the west, so pay 'im a visit if you find yerself headin' o'er there.${prompt};
Ah, I knew you were a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of discerning tastes! ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are special pieces o' glass with a bunch o' surprisingly magical properties.${prompt};
They're pretty darn popular, and so my stocks are always a breath away from bein' totally wiped out.${prompt};
So in an effort to keep things a lil' more fair, subsequent purchases of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} will cost you increasingly large amounts of escha silt.${prompt};
Whether you give 'em to loved ones as presents or use 'em for more esoteric purposes is up to you.${prompt};
And if you find the price is gettin' too steep, try comin' back a bit later. I may have happened upon some more in the meantime, lettin' me pass the savings on to you.${prompt};
But I got a bit off track. They aren't just fer decoratin' yer house. Together with grisly trinkets they can call forth some o' the most powerful baddies roamin' the land.${prompt};
Collect 'em all and head fer a particular place here in Escha and wham! Fresh meat fer the killin'.${prompt};
As I told you when we were talkin' 'bout ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, grisly trinkets are needed to summon some o' the more ornery creatures prowling Escha.${prompt};
Would that it were as simple as findin' one and callin' it a day, but there are so many that my head spins from keepin' track o' 'em all.${prompt};
Implyin', o' course, that each monster requires a diff'rent item.${prompt};
I wrote up a couple notes on each one, so have a gander at 'em if you wanna know more.${prompt};
Seekin' knowledge on vorseals, hmm?${prompt};
Bwaha, these little charms are somethin' else. We imported them from the east, and they're more'n just pretty pieces o' paper.${prompt};
Put 'em in your backpack, string 'em round your neck--heck, insert 'em in yer boots for all I care--but just possessin' 'em will bestow you with a variety of special benefits.${prompt};
You won't find a better deal anywhere!${prompt};
There are only two lil' problems--they only work here in Escha, and wear out after sixty minutes (Earth time).${prompt};
But e'ry cloud has its silver linin', and in this case, it's that the seals themselves remain.${prompt};
Dun' ask me why, but leavin' Escha and comin' back recharges the seals' energies. Chalk it up to some unnatural force if you want, but that's how things are.${prompt};
If you don't want a particular seal anymore, just return it to me and I'll take it off yer hands.${prompt};
If you change yer mind and decide you want the seal back...it's gonna cost you. If you want charity, I suggest you head elsewhere.${prompt};
I might have more vorseals for sale if you check back later, so be sure to come'n pay me a visit periodically.${prompt};
Some o' the items I brought from the Tenshodo are a bit simpler in nature, but I'm still willin' to part with 'em.${prompt};
Gotta cover all my bases, y'know?${prompt};
My stock tends to fluctuate o'er time, so it might be in yer best interests to stop in every so often.${prompt};
And who knows--maybe I'll get accustomed to that ugly mug o' yers! Bwahaha!${prompt};
Get a gander o' these reapers!${prompt};
They can be used to procure all manner of stuff from the grimslights scattered around Escha.${prompt};
Hoho, bet yer happy now that you ain't got escha silt and beads pourin' out o' yer pockets anymore!${prompt};
Nothin's more important than storage! Wi' one of these beauties ya can carry more silt an' beads.${prompt};

Ah, ${name-player}, just the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl] I wanna see. And ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] couldn't have come at a better time!${prompt};
I just got orders from Norg to help put down a rather unusual monster that's ${choice: 0}[supposed to show up/shown up] here in Escha.${prompt};
If yer headed down there to join the fight, I've got somethin' here yer gonna like!${prompt};
First things first, yer gonna need one o' these.${prompt};
Ya can have that one fer free!${prompt};
Now there's a lot more to say about that elvorseal. Just ask if ya wanna hear more.${prompt};
What, you ain't gonna fight? Well I ain't gonna blame ya fer valuin' yer life, hah! I'll hold on to this fer now.${prompt};
With that elvorseal on ya, not only will ya be able to touch Azi Dahaka across the dimensional rift, but ya can teleport directly to 'im.${prompt};
Don' even ask me about dimensional rifts or how this thing works. Someone back at the Tenshodo tried to explain it to me, I was even payin' attention that time and I didn' get a lick of what he was sayin', so I doubt you'd do any better.${prompt};
If yer feelin' ready to take him on, I'll teleport ya there now. What'dya say?${prompt};
Hmph. Well come back and let me know when you${choice-player-gender}['ve grown a pair/'re done playin' with yer dolls].${prompt};
Aye, that's what I wanna hear! One ticket to dragon land, best o' luck!${prompt};
Whoops! Almost forgot ta mention this.${prompt};
People say the faster ya cut down the monsters in that neck of the woods, the faster they'll reappear. Keep that in mind before gettin' carried away with the small fry.${prompt};
Just like on the outside, these days strange things've been goin' on in Escha.${prompt};
There's a strange monster I ain't never seen before been seen skulkin' about. Hard to say how long it'll be safe to be doin' business here at this rate.${prompt};
They call it Azi Dahaka. The weird thing is the big lizard always seems to show up in the same area and then disappears in a fixed pattern.${prompt};
Not only that, people are sayin' that the more ya defeat the monsters in the area, the faster he'll reappear.${prompt};
But here's where it really gets weird. Azi Dahaka doesn't exist in our dimension, at least, not quite. Even if the monster's standin' right in front of ya, yer weapons an' magic'll go right through it. O' course, that goes both ways. As long as the dimensional rift is there between us and the monster, it can't affect us.${prompt};
And before ya ask, let me tell ya that I am one-hundred-an'-one percent in favor o' just ignorin' the thing and gettin' back to business, but the man back in Norg's been breathin' down my neck to do somethin' about it. All about it ain't bein' good fer business, or Vana'diel, one o' those things.${prompt};
And that's where this thing comes in. It's called an elvorseal.${prompt};
This ain't no ordinary trinket. It's enchanted wi' blessings from one o' them shrines in the Far East.${prompt};
For a certain amount of time, it'll close the dimensional rift 'tween you an' the monster. Don' ask me how.${prompt};
Basically, as long as you've got that thing, yer weapons an' magic'll work on Azi Dahaka.${prompt};
'Course, sometimes an extra special baddie'll come out to wreak havoc. Now that's a sight--especiall when they disappear just as fast as they came.${prompt};
There's just somethin' 'bout the Far East, y'know?${prompt};
It ain't yer garden-variety vorseal, this thing. It's enchanted wi' a blessin' from a shrine in the Far East.${prompt};
Now I ain't no expert on magic artifacts, so I don' know the details, but this'll close the rift 'tween you an' Azi Dahaka temporarily.${prompt};
In short, if ya have the thing, ya can fight the monster.${prompt};
Jus' be aware that I can't be handin' out these things to any rookies that come by. Ya need to be at a high enough level before you can handle Azi Dahaka.${prompt};
Each elvorseal's magic will only work once, though. If Azi Dahaka is beaten, it'll go up in smoke.${prompt};
The same thing'll happen if ya leave Escha. Don' worry too much, I got a bunch right here, so come and see me if ya need a new one.${prompt};
A group o' adventurers that was fightin' Azi Dahaka said they saw 'im drop stuff when they got in close durin' the fight.${prompt};
'Course, if ya don't need waht you get from 'em, you can always give it to this guy in Norg. Said to be collectin' all things Escha.${prompt};
Well, the adventurers that came before ya have been reportin' that good things happen all around Escha after beatin' Azi Dahaka.${prompt};
Hey, you know about them mog tablet powers? Whatd'ya call them? It's kind o' like that, but fer Escha. These blessings affecting the area only seemed to show up after we started beatin' him.${prompt};
The area blessings can increase the amount of silt and beads ya can find here in Escha. They can also make portals eat up less o' your precious silt.${prompt};
That ain't the end of it, though.${prompt};
Beatin' Azi Dahaka once seems to increase the amount of stuff he drops when you fight 'im a second time. There are most definitely some perks to clobberin' that lizard for those of us in the Escha business. You get two birds wi' one stone, or, more like three. Hell, four birds if ya ask me.${prompt};
But it ain't all roses an' sunshine. Remember, every time ya clobber Azi Dahaka, he comes back a lil' bit stronger. Ya gotta know when to call it quits.${prompt};
That's pretty much the long an' short of it. So whad'ya say? We could use someone like you over there.${prompt};
Oh right, the area blessings. No problemo, might wanna jot these down so ya remember.${prompt};
These are the blessings currently in effect throughout the area...${prompt};
