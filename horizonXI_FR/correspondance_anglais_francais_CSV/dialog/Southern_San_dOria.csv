Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};

Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};

Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;

You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;

Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].;
I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.${prompt};
However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.${prompt};
I see that you currently have a trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.${prompt};
You do have the option to terminate your contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.;
Create a new contract with us?;
${selection-lines};
Immediately.;
Not today.${prompt};
Are you certain?;
${selection-lines};
I said, “Immediately.”;
On second thought...${prompt};
You have terminated your trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};
Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.${prompt};
If you happen to create a ${color: 5}high quality${color: 1} version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.${prompt};
Trading us these items will earn you “guild points” which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.${prompt};
The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.${prompt};
When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.${prompt};
I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.${prompt};
If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.${prompt};
You have formed a new trading contract with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};
The current requested item is ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;

How does the trade system work?${prompt};
You have ${number: 0} more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.${prompt};
Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.${prompt};
You can still receive up to ${number: 3} guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.${prompt};
You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.${prompt};

You must be one of those adventurers. I can tell by the fire in your eyes. For some reason this guild is popular with your type.${prompt};
We shall start you off with crystal synthesis.;
Without it, it will be impossible for you to continue your adventures and your new craft.${prompt};
Use a crystal, form an image of the completed product...and poof! Instant boots! Instant headbands!${prompt};
But in order to form a perfect image of a product, you must practice, practice, practice.;
I'm sure you have heard this before, but we all learn from our mistakes.${prompt};
If you wish, the others here will inform you of the materials you need to begin. They seem eager for you to join us.${prompt};
One way to quickly improve your skills is by asking fellow adventurers to gather skins. Then you can repay them with the fruits of your labor.${prompt};
My dream is to open shops all over Vana'diel. I am certain that with your help, it will become reality.${prompt};
I can see you are ready to move on. I want you to make me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
If you succeed, I will grant you a new title and teach you new techniques.${prompt};
Lovely work! You are now worthy of the title of ${choice: 7}[amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice].;

Succeed, and I will grant you the title of craftsman. You will then become a true member of our guild.${prompt};
However, that with the title of craftsman comes harder work and more difficult tasks.${prompt};
Juggling the techniques of numerous guilds will only lead to trouble. If you are ready to commit to the Tanners' Guild, then make me the item I asked for.${prompt};
Fabulous work!;
I am honored to call you a craftsman, and I thank you for contributing all you have for this guild.${prompt};
However, the real journey starts now. You must focus on the road ahead of you.${prompt};

It has come to my knowledge that you have taken a little detour on your journey to become a master leathercrafter.${prompt};
This is ultimately your decision, and I will not attempt to stop you. However, I must remind you that if you continue on that path, the only thing waiting for you is a dead end.${prompt};
If you truly wish to complete your journey, you must return to the main road--revoke your craftsman status for all other guilds.${prompt};
Revoke all other craftsman statuses?;
${selection-lines};
Immediately.;
Not just yet.${prompt};
Excellent. I will relay this news to the guildmasters of the other establishments.;
You may return to your work.${prompt};
I see.;
However, I strongly suggest you reconsider. You have much potential, ${name-player}. It would be terrible to see it go to waste.${prompt};
What brings you by my humble guild today, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]? Perhaps you wish to place a special order?${prompt};
......${prompt};
A costume to fool the Orcs... That may be more difficult than it sounds. You see, there may not be much in the way of gray matter between their stubby ears, but when it comes to hunting, their instincts play a much larger role than their eyesight.${prompt};
However, if you insist... Faulpie is not one to back down from a challenge.;
Oh, and as much as I'd like to do this out of the kindness of my heart, I do have a guild to run, so I am going to have to ask you to pay a small design fee of ${number: 2} gil. You understand, don't you?${prompt};
It will be a few more days before I can finish the pattern for your costume. Please come by again later. Oh, and don't forget to bring the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, and the ${number: 2} gil I asked for.${prompt};
Or...has the expense and time involved convinced you to abandon this venture?${prompt};
If you choose to give up, the quest will be canceled and your quest log reset.${prompt};
Cancel the quest?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Do you really wish to cancel the quest?;
${selection-lines};

I guess I don't.${prompt};
The quest has been canceled!${prompt};
Wonderful. Now that I have everything I require, I can begin working on the final product...... What? You didn't think I was going to be able to whip this together in a matter of minutes, did you?${prompt};
Don't tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I made for you, did you?${prompt};
What happened?;
${selection-lines};
My mauthe doog ate it.;
Oh, nothing...;
Actually, I think I've had enough...${prompt};
...Alright, alright. I will make you a new one, but this time it will cost you. I say about...${number: 1} gil should cover everything.${prompt};
Pay the ${number: 1} gil?;
${selection-lines};
I guess I have no choice.;
Over my dead mauthe doog's body!${prompt};
I will start on it right away. Come back in a few days to pick it up.${prompt};
I know that you must be in a hurry, but I haven't finished your order yet. Please come back later, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].${prompt};
Ah, just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I was looking for.;
Here is your order!${prompt};
What? You were expecting something different? I'm sorry, but this is as much as I can do. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
Take the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, two ${item-plural: 5[2]}, and two ${item-plural: 6[2]}, and synthesize them all together with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Anyone that has spent more than a few days honing his or her leatherworking skills should have no problem at all.${prompt};
And don't even think of telling me that you don't have enough skill. I know your work, and I know you have what it takes to complete this project.;
Now, as for your smithing and clothcraft skills, you'll have to be the judge on that...${prompt};
Oh, don't worry. Believe in yourself, and anything...well, almost anything is possible!${prompt};
What? You were expecting something different? I'm sorry, but this is as much as I can do. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
You see, most of us here at the Tanners' Guild have lost friends or family to the Orcish fiends. Just looking at that pattern brings back a lot of terrible memories...${prompt};
No, you will have to finish this project by yourself...;
But that might be a little easier said than done...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
That's it!${prompt};
Why not try to find a skilled tanner to assist you in crafting the mask? Here, let me give you the instructions on how to synthesize it...${prompt};
I'm sure there are a lot of adepts out there who would be more than happy to lend you a hand.${prompt};
(Just make sure they have also honed their skills in smithing and clothcrafting! We would not want any...accidents...)${prompt};
Just do not forget to thank them, if you know what I mean!${prompt};
What brings you by my humble guild today, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]? Perhaps you wish to place a special order?${prompt};
......${prompt};
You want to become a what? A Goblin?;
Hmmm... This will be quite more difficult than it seems. Though the stout little beastmen all appear to look alike, they are truly quite different.${prompt};
However, I was never one to back down from a challenge! I shall try my hand at designing your costume.;
Also, I will require a small fee of ${number: 2} gil.;
I have a guild to run, you know!${prompt};
I am so sorry. I still require more time to finish the costume design.;
Welcome back! I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is, I have finished the design for your costume, and I must say, it is fabulous! The bad news is, it shall take me several more days to finish the final cutting...${prompt};
Do not tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I made for you, did you?${prompt};

Over my dead mauthe doog's body!${prompt};
Excellent. I will start on it right away. Come back in a few days to pick up the finished cutting.${prompt};
I know that you must be in a hurry, but I have yet to complete the cutting. Reproducing the subtleties of the Goblins' ears is something that cannot be rushed!${prompt};
Ah, you are just in time. I have just finished putting the final touches on the cutting for your costume.${prompt};
Now, the rest is up to you, my fine tanner. Let me give you the list of the materials you shall require to complete the costume.${prompt};
・The ${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
Oh, and do not forget two ${item-plural: 7[2]} for the mask's eyes and a single ${item-singular: 0[2]} to synthesize the parts all together. If all goes well, you will be a bona fide Goblin in no time!${prompt};
Also, I suggest that you brush up on your smithing and clothcraft skills before attempting this feat...or maybe you already have been?${prompt};
I am sorry. I do not mean to question your abilities. I have full faith in you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Now, all the rest is up to you!;
What? You did not think that I would complete the costume for you...did you?${prompt};
Quite amusing!;
I am sorry if I misled you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], but neither I nor my colleagues here at the Tanners' Guild have any intention of crafting anything that even remotely reminds us of our number one rivals in the circles of leatherworking.${prompt};
...However, I also realize that you do not possess the skills to synthesize the final product yourself, and I do appreciate and value your business.${prompt};
How about you search for one of my pupils and ask him or her to help you in your quest?${prompt};
Here. Take down this list of ingredients...${prompt};
A quick shout in Southern San d'Oria or Lower Jeuno, and volunteers will be lining up before you know it!${prompt};
(Just make sure they are at least tanning adepts, and have also honed their skills in smithing and clothcrafting! We would not want any...accidents...)${prompt};
Oh, and do not forget to thank them when they have finished their job!${prompt};
Sorry, but I rrreally don't think you're ready for that rank yet.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a wonderful new method of leathercraft that allows you to soak skins in a tanning vat, making it easier to process more leather with one crystal.${prompt};
You want to make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.${prompt};
And if my memory serves me true, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} serves as the bonding agentaru.${prompt};
One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.${prompt};
Oh, did I mention ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
Naturally, to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you'll be needing one of those, too.${prompt};
You wish to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe!;
Its creation requires a few ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Toss ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.${prompt};
I fear we haven't ${item-plural: 0[2]} here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.${prompt};
What brings you here? Well, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, of all things...;
You couldn't hope to make one without some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.${prompt};
But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way.;
All that remains, then, is to bind it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} using ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Good luck!${prompt};
You... Yes, the description fits.;
I daresay, you're the one “she” sent, yes?${prompt};
Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?${prompt};
At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.${prompt};
Do as he says?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.;
Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.${prompt};
You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will turn ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.${prompt};
I'm currently investigating the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Hm? It appears you are overburdened.;
Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.${prompt};
That is most disappointing...;
“She” would not be pleased to hear of this.${prompt};
Ah, yes...${prompt};
A truly menacing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Buy for 800 gil? (You have ${number: 3});
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.${prompt};
It appears you haven't enough gil.${prompt};
Ah, a positively imposing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one of the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
I've eagerly awaited your return.;
With this image of the ${entity: 0}, I hold your task fulfilled.${prompt};
As promised, I relinquish this to you.;
Should another be required, you shall find me here.${prompt};
I need images of the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me images of the ${entity: 0} and the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me an image of the ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.${prompt};
I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.${prompt};
Is there something else you wish of me?;
You already have what you came for, no?${prompt};
We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.${prompt};
Putting up a fight, eh?;
Gorattz! Bompupu! Show ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] what the Tenshodo thinks of meddlesome adventurers!${prompt};
D-damn... I'm in way over my head...${prompt};
Ugh... ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s tougher than ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks...${prompt};
Waaah! I didn't signy-wign up for this...${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Renfred/Gorattz/Bompupu]'s shadow image disappears...${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Skeleton Scuffler/Blest Bones/Holey Horror/Steely Weapon/Lode Golem/Fired Urn] fades away into nothingness...${prompt};
The power of the Great Star Tree has been released!${prompt};
We warmly welcome you to the place of your unmaking.${prompt};
From your ground bones, a loaf of bread we shall be baking.${prompt};
We shall curse you unto death!;
Prepare to breathe your final breath!${prompt};
We will make you beg to die!;
Six fulms under you will lie!${prompt};
Naughty children shall receive no quarter!;
Curl up and die, this is your empress's order!${prompt};
You've long overstayed your welcome!;
The punishment will be brutal and gruesome!${prompt};
Which way do you like it--slow or fast?;
Should you lose a limb, be not aghast!${prompt};
You'll wish you were never born!;
From your torso limbs will be torn!${prompt};
Steel yourself for a wicked fright!${prompt};
We shall set your pants alight!${prompt};
The world shall bow before our might!${prompt};
H-how could this be?;
This outcome, we did not foresee...${prompt};
Be this a dream? Or is it real?;
This ending falls sorely short of ideal...${prompt};
that your abilities are purely for show.;
O～hohohohoho!${prompt};
A fitting end for a talentless crew;
that tried to bite off more than it could chew.;
O～hohohohoho!${prompt};
Your body absorbs the power held within the ancient runes!${prompt};
You cannot enter this battlefield with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in your possession.${prompt};
It appears you must wait longer to commence the battle.${prompt};
You are not in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
You cannot enter the battlefield for “${choice: 1}${choice: 1}[Sugar-coated Directive/Battaru Royale/Project: Shantottofication]” with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in your possession.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has no effect.;
It appears you should come back later.${prompt};
You are not in possession of a sap crystal.;
Unable to enter the battlefield for “Battaru Royale.”${prompt};
The sap crystal has no effect.;
More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for “Battaru Royale.”${prompt};
You are not in possession of a Tablet of Hexes.;
Unable to enter the battlefield for “Project: Shantottofication.”${prompt};
The Tablet of Hexes has no effect.;
More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for “Project: Shantottofication.”${prompt};
The door is sealed.${prompt};
Your opponents deem you too weak to be worthwhile, disappearing whence they came.${prompt};
You have distinguished yourself as ${choice: 0}[a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master], but there remain leathercrafting techniques outside your repertoire.;
Do you wish to continue your training?${prompt};
Continue your training?;
${selection-lines};
Certainly!;
Perhaps another time.${prompt};
Splendid! I knew you were going places from the day you first walked into our halls.;
To take the next step in your career as a tanner, you'll need to talk to Alivatand and procure a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Mind you, we aren't giving them away for free.;
Consider the fee in guild points a requisite part of your training.${prompt};
Say it isn't so, ${name-player}!;
And here I thought we would open up shop together someday!${prompt};
To take the next step in your career as a tanner, you'll need to talk to Alivatand and procure a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Now here's a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who knows the contents of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} like the back of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] calloused hands.${prompt};
What are we waiting for, then?;
As the next step in your training, I'd like you to craft for me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
The necessary materials are...${prompt};
And do not forget to carve your name into the leather.;
It's not that we don't trust you, of course, but rules are rules.${prompt};
Forgotten your recipe, have you?;
Take heart: even the best of us have our off days.;
Anyhow, to make ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, you'll be needing...${prompt};
Now this...this is a fine piece of leather!;
If anyone ever deserved the title of expert, it's you.;
I can hardly wait until the day we go into business together!${prompt};
I must admit, ${name-player}. I expected better of you.;
The craftsmanship is passable, but it lacks a certain something...${prompt};
And no wonder! Wherever is your signature?;
No, I'm afraid this won't do at all. Back to work for you.${prompt};
I have watched you closely since you started here. I would like to see you make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Succeed, and I will grant you the title of ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran]. You will then become a true member of our guild.${prompt};
However, with that comes harder work and more difficult tasks.${prompt};
Juggling the techniques of numerous guilds will only lead to trouble. If you are ready to commit to the Tanners' Guild, then make me the item I asked for.${prompt};
Remember that mastering the techniques necessary to become ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran] requires considerable focus and devotion.;
You will find it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain such a high level of skill in multiple disciplines.${prompt};
We must talk, ${name-player}.;
I hear that you have been recognized as ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran] at another guild.${prompt};
Surely you realize that such diversions will stunt your leathercrafting skills?;
This cannot possibly be your intention.${prompt};
Which is why you have returned to express your intention to relinquish any other ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] titles you hold and redouble your efforts as a member of our guild.${prompt};
I am correct, yes?;
Just tell me which guild you tire of, and I shall convey your decision to the guildmaster.${prompt};
...I see.;
Then it would seem we have nothing more to discuss.${prompt};
I fail to see how any other craft could be as rewarding as leathercrafting, but to each ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own.${prompt};

What do you want with this gatehouse?${prompt};

${selection-lines};
A mission, please.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Hmm...not much work for those wet behind the ears, but...${prompt};
How about slaying Orcish scouts? Only the yellowest of yearlings would run from that, and we've no work for cowards here.${prompt};
If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.${prompt};
Interested?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Never mind.${prompt};
"Here's your mission. Orcish scouts roam outside; kill one and bring me his axe as proof.${prompt}";
You'll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. No other kind will do. Understand?${prompt};
That is all. You'll take the mission then?${prompt};
Do you accept the mission?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
Could you explain again?;
No, thank you.${prompt};
"Bring me one of those axes, and your mission will be a success. No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}";
Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt};
That's another ${item-singular: 0[2]} for the armory, then. Mission complete! Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt};
What? I don't want this!${prompt};
Are you really a new recruit!?${prompt};
Listen, before you bring me something, you must first accept the mission! That is how things work around here!${prompt};
Persistent, aren't you? An Orc under the belt does not a hero make! Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt};
Bat patrol! How about it? Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself, no?${prompt};
Here's your mission, then. Clear out bats lurking in King Ranperre's Tomb and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt};
Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and your mission will be a success.${prompt};
"Deep in the tomb you'll find Goblins. Take care; I don't want to lose you yet.${prompt}";
Ah, you've returned! I was afraid that Goblins got you.${prompt};
That's one ${item-singular: 3[2]} for the gatehouse, then. Mission complete. Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt};
Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt};
Well, perhaps you can be of some help. Many of our children have disappeared mysteriously, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt};
The Royal Knights should be on the job by now, but the two princes are at each other's throats.${prompt};
Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt};
While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt};
They've been arguing this back and forth for days. The knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt};
If you really want to make a name for yourself, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt};
What say you? Will you go?${prompt};
Here's your mission, then. Rescue the two children kidnapped by the Orcs of Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt};
Ghelsba Outpost is northwest of West Ronfaure. Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the entrance up in the hills.${prompt};
If you have trouble finding the way, just follow one of the soldiers on patrol.${prompt};
Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check them first.${prompt};
Ah, you've returned! You were gone so long, I feared a warmachine had got you!${prompt};
At any rate, mission complete! And to reward your accomplishment...${prompt};
I hereby recognize you, ${name-player}, as a certified adventurer of San d'Oria! You're now mission rank two, as well.${prompt};
But don't get too excited. Your title is valid only here in San d'Oria, understand?${prompt};
In order to become a true adventurer, and bear ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you must be recognized by Bastok and Windurst as well.${prompt};
'Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law. I know it's hard, but those are the rules.${prompt};
For now, cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt};
You achieve rank 2!${prompt};
There's not much work in right now. I suppose you could go participate in the Temple Knights' rescue drills out on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
Enter the forest beyond the Westgate and head southwest. You'll come out onto the La Theine Plateau before long.${prompt};
Once you're out on the plateau, keep going until you see the knights. The training grounds aren't far from there.${prompt};
It's all just a drill, so this should be easy compared to your usual fare. Just follow orders and you'll be fine.${prompt};
You've returned! I hear the drill turned into something far more perilous. But real battle is the best drill for recruits, in my opinion.${prompt};
Regardless, you've done well. I'll turn to you when there's work to be done, now.${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Go ahead, you've earned it.${prompt};
This time it's messenger duty. One of our knights is out scouting in a place called Davoi, on the southern edge of Jugner Forest.${prompt};
The Orcs' stronghold is in Davoi, so it's vital that we stop them from massing, or they may launch an assault.${prompt};
Of course, the Orcs are keeping an eye on us, too. Why, just a few days past, a squad of our Royal Knights fell to their axes.${prompt};
We have sent scouts to find a weakness in their defenses. You must find the scout there now, and bring back the latest scouting report.${prompt};
The scout's name is Zantaviat. He's somewhere in Davoi, but where I cannot say.${prompt};
Come back after you've gotten the report. Those lands are no place to wander.${prompt};
You have returned! And you've brought the scouting report. Good work, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Troubling news, this is. It says that Orcs are gathering deep inside the encampment. The time to act is coming!${prompt};
But that is not your concern. You've done well today. Mission complete!${prompt};
Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. And at just the right time, too. Monarlais Halver is looking for an adventurer such as yourself.${prompt};
"Enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver is there; he'll explain in person.${prompt}";
What? You haven't been certified in Bastok and Windurst yet? You may dally, but others are not! Get moving!${prompt};
Ah, welcome back. I see you've been certified in Bastok and Windurst. Good work. You'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt};
What's that, a report for our kingdom? I see. Take that to the monarlais when you go.${prompt};
You should receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Monarlais Halver. Now, go to Chateau d'Oraguille and let them know you're back!${prompt};
Hurry to Chateau d'Oraguille and give that report to Monarlais Halver!${prompt};
You achieve rank 3!${prompt};
Ah! You've come at just the right time. Zantaviat, one of our scouts in Davoi, needs an adventurer.${prompt};
He wants someone to infiltrate Davoi and scout behind enemy lines. Know anyone fitting that description?${prompt};
Now that you've got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, this is an opportunity to prove you're worth it!${prompt};
The situation in Davoi worsens by the day. This won't be easy, but I can't think of a better adventurer for the job!${prompt};
You've returned! Zantaviat told me everything. Congratulations on a job well done!${prompt};
But we can't let down our guard yet. Those Orcs will not just sit there. We must keep constant vigil, and move before they do!${prompt};
Here's your reward: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You're becoming quite the adventurer, aren't you?${prompt};
Welcome back! I have an important mission for you this time. Recently, land is eroding due to crystal formation...and it's getting worse.${prompt};
There's a small spring on the eastern edge of Jugner Forest, called Crystwater Spring. We must know what effect crystal formation has on the wildlife there.${prompt};
I want you to get me a fish from the spring. And not just any fish! You need to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, that reminds me--have you any fishing gear? You'll need some for this mission.${prompt};
There are people about that know a thing or two about fishing, should you need help finding and choosing your gear.${prompt};
Ah, the great angler returns! I was worried, to be honest. All you hear these days is the massing of beasts, the erosion of the Crystal Lines, and now...${prompt};
...rumors that the Shadow Lord himself has returned!${prompt};
We will examine the fish you brought. Depending on the results, we may need to act! I'll let you know if we need your help.${prompt};
Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. You've come at a good time. I've news for you.${prompt};
By order of the Kingdom of San d'Oria, you're to head to Jeuno as an ambassadorial attaché.${prompt};
Go to Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver will tell you all you need to know.${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
There you are! I've been looking for you. Monarlais Halver requests your presence at the chateau immediately.${prompt};
It sounds as if this is a fairly important mission. I need not remind you that you should take care to properly equip yourself before embarking on this journey.${prompt};
I'm not sure what it's about, but you'd best make haste. The monarlais is not to be kept waiting!${prompt};
Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! This is no time for loafing around, friend! Prince Trion is looking for you.${prompt};
For this next mission, he's requested you personally. You should be honored!${prompt};
As for the details of the mission, I've no idea what he wants, but he was in a hurry. You'd best be off to Chateau d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It is a great thing you've done, ${name-player}! I knew deep in my heart that you were the one for the task.${prompt};
You'd better get to the chateau quick. They're all waiting to welcome you back, I'd wager.${prompt};
You've saved our proud Kingdom of San d'Oria. No, you're the savior of all Vana'diel! There's not a soul that doesn't owe you a great debt, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
You had best hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille. It seems as if something terrible is in the works there.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
Your timing is perfect. The chateau just sent a request for an adventurer.${prompt};
It looks as if this next mission has something to do with the late queen. You should feel honored. It's not every day that an adventurer gets to work directly with the royal family.${prompt};
Spoken like a true San d'Orian!;
Now hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille and get the details on the mission from Monarlais Halver.${prompt};
What's wrong? Dealing with royalty is not your cup of tea? Well, think about it and come back when you've come to your senses.${prompt};
Prince Trion is requesting the aid of an adventurer. How about it?${prompt};
It looks fairly urgent, so you should hurry to the chateau. The prince is waiting in his chambers.${prompt};
I expected more from you, ${name-player}. If you change your mind, return here. I'll be waiting.${prompt};
I have received the details of your mission from Prince Trion. I will deliver this book to the scholars for deciphering.${prompt};
The deciphering of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will take a considerable amount of time. Return later for a report.${prompt};
You handed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over to the guard.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. We've been waiting.;
Prince Trion is calling for you. I wonder if this means the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been completely deciphered.${prompt};
Well done, ${name-player}! I knew you would not let the Kingdom down.${prompt};
I'm proud to increase your rank to 7!${prompt};
The papsque has work for you, ${name-player}. Are you willing to take on the task?${prompt};
Excellent. Proceed to the papsque's chambers on the third floor of the cathedral.${prompt};
The papsque often comes across as a difficult man, but he is actually very kindhearted and compassionate. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.${prompt};
The fair Claidie I d'Oraguille has invited you to the chateau. She wishes for you to see the flowers that have bloomed from the seeds you brought back from Altepa.${prompt};
It is an honor to be invited to the chateau garden. One day you may even have the opportunity to attend one of their royal garden parties.${prompt};
We cannot keep the princess waiting. Now, off to the chateau!${prompt};
A party of Royal Knights stationed in Ghelsba Outpost have reported strange activity by Orcs deep within Yughott Grotto.${prompt};
From your reports, we already know that the beastmen have built a giant portal, but their motives remain unclear.${prompt};
It makes me shudder to think of what those Orcs are planning with that portal...${prompt};
${name-player}, your next mission is to travel to Ghelsba and continue your investigation into the Orcs' activities.${prompt};
Be on your guard when traveling deep into Yughott Grotto. Losing an adventurer such as yourself would deal a great blow to all of San d'Oria.${prompt};
I see you need more time for preparations. When you are ready, I'll be waiting.${prompt};
It's hard to believe Orcs have their hands on such dangerous equipment. More patrols will have to be sent out to prevent any new developments in their evil plans.${prompt};
And this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... We will have to analyze it and begin reproduction for our forces. We cannot let Orcs get the Treasure of the Dragon King before San d'Oria does.${prompt};
Well, congratulations on the completion of your mission. Hmmm? Do I know of an adventurer named Eideialc? Never heard of him.${prompt};
But you need not worry about some petty traveler. You are in a different league. You are now rank 8!${prompt};
Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. This ceremony is an important facet of d'Oraguille tradition.${prompt};
Monarlais Halver has put out a call to high-ranking adventurers for their assistance in Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
Ah, the young princess has finally become a lady... Oh, I'm sorry. You can get the details of your next mission from Sir Halver.${prompt};
What? You do not wish to repay the kindness the princess has shown to you in the past months? As you wish...but if you change your mind, you know where to find me.${prompt};
I am busy with preparations for Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony. You don't know what kind of vermin could be roaming the streets and looking for trouble.${prompt};
Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is about to begin at the cathedral. I must remain at my post, but why don't you attend?${prompt};
The king has requested your audience. He has selected you from the mountain of adventurers in San d'Oria. You should feel honored!${prompt};
You have matured from a fledgling adventurer into a great asset to our kingdom. Do not let us down.${prompt};
There is no need for modesty at a time like this. The fate of San d'Oria is at stake!${prompt};
The authorities are saying that a dark cloud of despair is looming over the Kingdom. They are asking for the assistance of only the best adventurers.${prompt};
I can think of none more qualified than you. Will you accept this mission?${prompt};
Then proceed to the Audience Chamber in the Chateau d'Oraguille.;
Word has it that His Highness is not feeling that well. He may not be present for your briefing.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! The Kingdom is counting on you. Who else, I ask you, is worthy for this task?${prompt};
Ah, a time of great change is upon us. In a matter of days, the Rites of Succession will be held at the cathedral in Northern San d'Oria. It is then that the new heir to the throne will be decided.${prompt};
Due to the unpredictable circumstances that took place at the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, this time, only authorized personnel will be allowed near the proceedings. However, the royal family has requested your services as a guard.${prompt};
Even we Royal Knights have not been granted permission to attend... You must be held in high regard by His Highness. I envy you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am].${prompt};
When you have finished your preparations, proceed directly to the cathedral to report.${prompt};
Off the record, which of the two princes do you think should be the next heir to the throne?${prompt};
It is a difficult decision, but...;
${selection-lines};
Trion is better suited.;
Pieuje is better suited.${prompt};
Hm...;
Being the oldest, he is the true heir, and many people believe he is the most suited to rule the Kingdom. However, Prince Pieuje's prudent ways may be what this country is lacking.${prompt};
Many think as you do, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. However, what this country may need is someone who will not back down in the face of a threat--someone who will stand up for the pride of the Kingdom.${prompt};
But our opinion is of no matter. Lightbringer will decide who is the most suited to stand over our fine nation. And do not speak a word of today's exchange, for the monarlais will have our heads if he finds out.${prompt};
I realize that you must have many preparations before taking on such an important mission. Take your time and return here when you are ready.${prompt};

If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...${prompt};
The Troupe Valeriano, at your service! Well, I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kinda gal, not an entertainer.${prompt};
People call me “Nokky the Tree-shaker”! While the other guys are doing their thing, I work on the sidelines as a quiver-maker. Basically, I can make it easier for you to lug around those bundles of ninety-nine arrows or bolts or whatever.${prompt};
I've been doing this for a while now, so I've learned to bundle all sorts of stuff...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ${item-plural: 3[2]}, ${item-plural: 4[2]}, and ${item-plural: 5[2]} I've always been able to do...${prompt};
But now I can also bundle ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ${item-plural: 3[2]}, ${item-plural: 4[2]}, and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt};
Not to mention ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ${item-plural: 3[2]}, ${item-plural: 4[2]}, ${item-plural: 5[2]}, and ${item-plural: 6[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and plain old ${item-plural: 1[2]}!${prompt};
And of course, ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and ${item-plural: 4[2]}!${prompt};
Then there's everyone's favorite ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Finally, new to my bundling repertoire, we have ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]}!${prompt};
I can even bundle those elemental cards that corsairs use!${prompt};
Aren't you imprrressed?;
Keeping up with all these new types of ammunition is hard work!${prompt};
Oh, and for the rrrecord, anything else is too much trrrouble to deal with. Not my thing.${prompt};
This ain't no charity, though. I'm not really interested in gil, but... Let's see here... Flowers...? Yeah, you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for every ninety-nine arrows, bolts, or whatever you want organized, and we got a deal. ${prompt};
I can make a quiver or pouch for up to seven sets of the same kind of ammunition. So you could bring me, say, one hundred ninety-eight ${item-plural: 1[2]} and two of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example. I like to do things real efficient-like, you see, so make sure they're in multiples of ninety-nine.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} smiles slyly at you.;
What kinda smart-alecky baloney is this!? I told you to bring me the same kinda ammunition in complete sets. And don't forget the flowers, neither.${prompt};
Just a moment there, my fine friend, got a call coming in on my linkshell. Come back in a bit and I'll sort you out.${prompt};
And here you go! Come back soon, and bring your friends!${prompt};
I'm real sorry, but there's nothing I can do with those.${prompt};
It's time for the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza, kupo!;
Here, take this “initial egg.” Collect and trade eggs until you have made a “First 3” combination. When you're done, bring the combo back to me for an egg-squisite prize, kupo!${prompt};
This year, those who make special undecennial combinations will receive particularly egg-ceptional prizes, kupo!${prompt};
Of course, we wouldn't want you counting your chocobos before they hatch. Please egg-xert the effort to make a “First 3” combination before going all out on these spegg-tacular new ones, kupo.${prompt};
When you've gathered a “First 3” combination, bring the eggs back to me! Also, if you want, I can trade you more initial eggs, but you'll have to make it worth my while, kupo!${prompt};
Well, that's it for my anniversary egg-splanation. Happy hunting, kupo!${prompt};
Egg-cellent! Here's your prize, kupo!;
Now if only somebody would bring me a super combo... Oh, egg-scuse me! Forget I said that, kupo!${prompt};
Egg-straordinary!;
Here's your special prize, kupo!;
But how did you figure out the secret combination...?${prompt};
How in-eggs-plicably astounding! You're truly a hard-boiled detective of the highest degree, kupo!;
Here's your prize, and don't forget to enjoy the rest of the festivities.${prompt};
Hey, don't get all egg-cited!;
You can only claim one prize a day, kupo!${prompt};
These initial eggs are really egg-spensive, kupo! If you want one I'm going to need a little more incentive. No egg-ceptions!${prompt};
Eggs-actly what I wanted! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
Ku-kupo! Such an egg-stravagant item, for little old me? Here's a whole basketful of initial eggs for you, kupo!${prompt};
My eyes! My eyes!;
Get out of here, and take those egg-ceptionally nasty things with you, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...;
Kupo～～～! Please! No more, kupo!;
Here, take these and get out of here, kupo!${prompt};
Hey, I can only trade with you once a day. We wouldn't want to make the egg hunt “over easy,” now, kupo!${prompt};
Hey, you look new here, kupo!;
If you need anything, just let me know!${prompt};
Heh heh heh...;
I have something egg-specially egg-citing in store for you, kupo!${prompt};

${name-player}...;
Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.;
The time left to me is short.;
Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt};
I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...;
It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt};
Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt};
A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt};
My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.;
Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt};
Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.;
You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.;
My hopes go with you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.${prompt};
There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.${prompt};
The strands of grass here have been tied together.${prompt};
There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt};
I see you have met with Raogrimm.;
His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt};
In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt};
You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.${prompt};
It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is one of those items.${prompt};
You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...${prompt};
That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt};
Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt};
The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt};
We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt};
Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to guide you...${prompt};
I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...${prompt};
As part of my penance, I will infuse the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with what guidance I can.;
I betrayed him...;
And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...${prompt};
Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...${prompt};
I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...;
Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt};
Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...;
This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt};
Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.;
Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt};
I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt};
Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt};
Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.;
There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.${prompt};
There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt};
I have been waiting for you.${prompt};
"Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? ""The link will soon be severed""...";
Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt};
When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...;
Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt};
Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt};
The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt};
Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.;
The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt};
You must obtain the last trophy.;
All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt};
Take care, my brave adventurer.;
May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...;
Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.;
This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt};
I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.;
Is this what they call karma...?${prompt};
This land has borne the weight of my sins.;
I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt};
So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...;
Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.;
Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt};
It is time!;
Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.;
Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt};
Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.;
Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt};
It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt};
There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt};
Please pay no mind to my ramblings.;
You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt};
You will need four such trophies.;
Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt};
I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt};
Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt};
It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.;
If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt};
This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt};
When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.;
That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt};
What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.;
But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt};
That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt};
Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!;
I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt};
Now, ${name-player}.;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt};
Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt};
The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt};
I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt};
Wait, wait, wait!;
I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...;
How can I explain it?${prompt};
Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt};
But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!;
You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt};
But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.;
These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.;
The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt};
It must have been in the time of the Great War...;
Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt};
Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt};
Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.;
Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt};
Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.;
However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt};
Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt};
Is it over...?${prompt};
No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt};
As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt};
Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt};
${name-player}...;
You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.;
I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt};
The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.;
I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt};
The one who holds sway...?${prompt};
Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.;
I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt};
You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.;
The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt};
It was an error in judgment to shelter you...;
The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt};
I give to you a duty...;
You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt};
No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.;
No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt};
What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?;
As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt};
Of one thing I was certain.;
This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt};
A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt};
Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.;
It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt};
Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.;
Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt};
${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt};
The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.;
And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt};
Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.;
I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt};
My old companions...?;
This duty is too much for just one to bear.;
If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.;
It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt};
That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt};
Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?;
I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt};
Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.;
I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt};
C'mon, let's see a little excitement!;
This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt};
It's not the Northlands this time.;
None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt};
I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.;
Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt};
I thought this would be the end of you for sure...;
Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt};
What, no words for an old friend?;
Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt};
I betrayed you!;
I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!;
The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt};
Everything began thirty years ago.;
And there were things that came to an end...;
Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt};
And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.${prompt};
I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions.;
No matter who that person may be.${prompt};
Raogrimm...${prompt};
Are you sure you want to do this?;
This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land.;
As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...${prompt};
Raogrimm.;
There is no need to suffer alone anymore.;
Our presence here should answer your question.${prompt};
There are crimes that must be atoned for.;
And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.${prompt};
Until the dawn of an age without hatred...;
No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.${prompt};
Cornelia...${prompt};

There is a strange symbol drawn here.;
A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...${prompt};
You hear a mysterious, floating voice:;
Present the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...if you wish to pass into...my dream.${prompt};
You hear a mysterious, floating voice:;
The sands of time yet fall...;
Present the...${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I am the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt};
Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs?;
Either way, this is not your dream.${prompt};
The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard. ${prompt};
Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?${prompt};
I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.${prompt};
While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.${prompt};
The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.${prompt};
Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.${prompt};
A nightmare curses this land yet again.${prompt};
Take heed, dream traveler.${prompt};
I have been watching your dream.${prompt};
But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there.;
This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.${prompt};
You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.${prompt};
I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...${prompt};
The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.${prompt};
Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place...;
The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.${prompt};
The entrance to the dream has already been opened.;
Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.${prompt};
I am...a unique entity...${prompt};
We are...comprised of all entities...${prompt};
Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...${prompt};
And devouring one another...${prompt};
The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.${prompt};
It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.${prompt};
It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.${prompt};
Could it have been that girl...?;
When I next see her, she will pay dearly.${prompt};
Could it have been that girl...?;
No, there was one more, transformed after death...${prompt};
Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.${prompt};
You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.${prompt};
The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness...;
Could it have been transferred to another girl...?${prompt};
You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.${prompt};
“Trade” the ${item-singular: 6[2]} to the “Hieroglyphics” found in each area. The ${item-singular: 6[2]} will be transformed into ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};

This weakened state will last for longer than the usual period experienced after being raised from KO status.${prompt};
Upon entering Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], you will be unable to reenter using a different ${item-singular: 7[2]} for ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[day/days] (Earth time).${prompt};

Also, items dropped by enemies become available for every character in the area to cast lots on. As in normal parties, the item is gained by the character who casts the highest lot.${prompt};
Please be aware that items not lotted for within the restricted time may go to random characters or be lost entirely.${prompt};
Starting from when the first character enters, if the number of people in Dynamis - ${choice: 0}[Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] reaches and remains at zero for approximately ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[minute/minutes] (Earth time), the time and area designation on the ${item-singular: 7[2]} will be canceled.${prompt};

Wait, the expedition has returned.${prompt};
Halt! I must inspect your ranks for infiltrators.${prompt};
Oh, let us through. We are exhausted!${prompt};
Still I must check for infiltrators. As a Temple Knight, I am responsible for the safety of the citadel. You Royal Knights must cooperate.${prompt};
Is this how you thank us, treating us like criminals!${prompt};
You Temple Knights have it easy, safe inside these walls. We have no time for your games!${prompt};
How dare you!${prompt};
What is going on here?${prompt};
Lady Curilla! These Royal Knights refuse to verify their identities.${prompt};
Welcome back, Royal Knights. You must be weary. After reporting to Prince Trion, shed your armor and see your families. Long have they waited for you.${prompt};
Yes, Lady Curilla!${prompt};
Royal Knights, forward!${prompt};
Those knights are back from a dangerous mission. Remember that sometimes rules can be bent.${prompt};
Take pride in your duties, and do not mind the trivial. Remember, we are the face of San d'Oria!${prompt};
Yes, madam!${prompt};
And to the new recruit, I say this: The glory of San d'Oria depends upon each and every citizen! Good luck!${prompt};
General Curilla, bravo. You are gifted with much sympathy.${prompt};
Without your Temple Knights, we Royal Knights could not patrol the wilderness. Your order is a sturdy pillar upon which we rest.${prompt};
We are not your servants, Rahal. But tell me how fared your patrol.${prompt};
You seem drawn to the world outside, Curilla. Perhaps you find this fortress too constraining?${prompt};
None of your business. But your troops did look weary. Did you make any progress against the enemy?${prompt};
No, it is ever the same. No one can tell what Orcs may do next. And always must I struggle with two chains of command.${prompt};
You know, Prince Trion and Prince Pieuje. I see the wisdom in both their strategies, but--${prompt};
Rahal, we needn't discuss this before the recruit. Shall we walk to the castle?${prompt};
It would be an honor! Let us enjoy a bottle of 812 Rolanberry in the warmth of my chamber.${prompt};
Well, I prefer the strategy council room. I shall make Batallia tea should you thirst.${prompt};
Hah! Ever the same, I see.${prompt};
That was General Curilla of the Temple Knights. Her order watches over the city and protects Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
Rahal's Royal Knights, on the other hand, spy on our enemies and battle fiends.${prompt};
With such disparate duties, the two orders maintain a tense rivalry.${prompt};
Perhaps I could be of service. Is there anything you'd like to know?${prompt};
Something you'd like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing, actually.;
I'd like to get out of the city.;
I'd like to do some shopping.;
Tell me more about adventuring.${prompt};
Just arrived and you're aching to leave, eh? Listen, the lands are wild beyond our gates, filled with fiends and their ilk.${prompt};
But if you must, go up those stairs, head for Northern San d'Oria, then go out Ranperre Gate. Go through the guild area and take a right to get to the gate. Got that?${prompt};
Should you need directions, ask those around you. Our citizens are friendly, for the most part.${prompt};
Wait, wait--one more thing. Should someone aid you, be sure to show them your gratitude. That is all.${prompt};
If you want to buy weapons or other supplies, just ask one of the merchants in town.${prompt};
Ahh, recruits... Don't know which way to hold a sword and you think you're ready for adventures. Well, what would you like to know?${prompt};
You need to go to the Novice's Hall. You'll find it in Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
What would you like to hear about?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Hunting monsters.;
Making easy money.;
Working for my country.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Come to think of it, there was a lady in front of a house on the west side of Southern San d'Oria. She may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Hmm, yes... Come to think of it, there was a lady just down those stairs. She may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Ahh, recruits... Don't know your own limits until a fiend beats it into your head for you. Very well. How about gathering some hides?${prompt};
Pass through Victory Arch in Northern San d'Oria to arrive in Southern San d'Oria, where you'll find the Tanners' Guild. They're in need of hides every now and then.${prompt};
If you have trouble finding the Tanners' Guild, just ask around.${prompt};
Easy money, eh? Typical of a new recruit. I cannot promise ease, but try the lumberyard in Northern San d'Oria. Should be enough work for you there.${prompt};
Go up those stairs to get to Northern San d'Oria. You can see the lumberyard from there.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice for a new recruit. Head to any city gate and inquire at the gatehouse. They'll give you work befitting your rank.${prompt};
Perhaps I could be of service. Is there anything in particular you'd like to know?${prompt};
I could ramble for days, but much of my wisdom would be lost on you. If there's anything you want to know, just ask me.${prompt};
Something you'd like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing in particular.;
I want to go out and do battle!;

Right behind you is the Westgate. Beyond that, the wilds of West Ronfaure.${prompt};
Should you need directions, ask those around you. Our citizens are friendly, for the most part.${prompt};
But watch where you're going this time!${prompt};
Wait, wait--one more thing. Should you receive the aid of another, show your gratitude. That is all.${prompt};
Above all else, uphold the honor of San d'Oria. We take pride in our kingdom, and so should you.${prompt};
Should you seek weapons, armor, or supplies, there are several shops in this area. Why not go have a look?${prompt};
Ahh, recruits... Don't know which way to hold a sword and you think you're ready for adventures. Well, what would you like to know?${prompt};
You really are a handful! Go talk to the people in town. I'm sure you'll find something to do.${prompt};
What would you like to hear about?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Hunting monsters.;
Making easy money.;
Working for my country.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Come to think of it, there was a lady in front of a house on Pikeman's Way. She may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Novices... Don't know your own limits until a fiend beats it into your head for you. Very well. How about gathering some hides for the Tanners' Guild on Pikeman's Way?${prompt};
工人通りへ行くには、まず凱旋門を;
くぐって北サンドリアへ出ろ。閲兵場の左にある;
ゲートを抜ければ見えるはずだ。${prompt};
Easy money, eh? Typical of a new recruit. I cannot promise ease, but the lumberyard in Northern San d'Oria should have work for you there.${prompt};
To get to the lumberyard, go through Victory Arch, head northwest across the Parade Grounds, and keep going till you reach Laborman's Way. The lumberyard lies at the far end.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice for a new recruit. Head to any city gate and inquire at the gatehouse. You'll be doing work for the glory of the Kingdom!${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Give it to Ailevia in Victory Square. I'll show you where she is on your map.${prompt};
To give items to others, select “Trade” from the main menu. Don't you forget it!${prompt};
I say! Watch where you're going!${wait-animation: 5}${prompt};
Ah, Ceraule! What are you doing there?${prompt};
My lord Prince Trion! I was just talking to this recruit about what it means to be a proud citizen of San d'Oria!${prompt};
A new recruit, are you? Strengthen your sword arm and your stature as a knight. Thus will you best serve the glory of our great kingdom.${prompt};
San d'Oria has more than enough soldiers already, brother. Speaking of which, should you not be training them, instead of bothering new recruits with talk of war?${prompt};
You are too bold!${prompt};
Really, Pieuje! Is that any way to speak to your brother?${prompt};
I've said the truth, nothing more. The ranks of our armies could swell to bursting, and still victory would not be certain.${prompt};
It is your head that is swollen, brother. With a large enough army, we can crush the beastmen, without resorting to your misguided tactics!${prompt};
Misguided, am I? Tell me, what then were the tactics that lost a whole company of our warriors in the Batallia Downs the other day?${prompt};
It's good you're so fond of talking, as I've never seen you wield a sword. Better to shout orders from the rear than reveal your ineptitude in combat!${prompt};
Stop your quarreling, both of you!${prompt};
A divided leadership only creates unrest among the people, soldier and civilian alike. Surely you are both well aware of this?${prompt};
Very well. I've heard more than I wish to hear from my brother already. I warn you, Pieuje, talk to me in this way again and I shall not be so forgiving.${prompt};
Oh, Trion. Threats of violence are his only answer when a conversation does not go as he would have it. Like a child, he is!${prompt};
You are both like children, quick to insult and quicker to take offense! Really...${prompt};
I must apologize for that. But ours is truly a great kingdom, and I expect you to further her glory.${prompt};
Those two are a handful, but despite their constant quarrelling, they are the closest of brothers.${prompt};
Ohh, what a fine pickle this is!${prompt};
Oh, what to do? My husband is on patrol in West Ronfaure, but he forgot his salve when he went out this morning!${prompt};
It's a dangerous job he does, and you never know when a good ointment could save your life! Perhaps you could take it to him?${prompt};
I'd take it myself, to be sure, but I cannot leave the city.${prompt};
Deliver the ointment?;
${selection-lines};
Of course I will.;
Not right now.${prompt};
I thank you! His name is Aaveleon.${prompt};
He patrols the wilderness outside, but not too far from Westgate.${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
I cannot accept this. Take it back.${prompt};
Could you not find my husband?${prompt};
His name is Aaveleon. Please, deliver the ointment to him. I fear he may need it.${prompt};
You...haven't misplaced the ointment I gave you, by any chance?${prompt};
You lost the ointment?;
${selection-lines};
No, it's right here!;
I lost it.${prompt};
Ah, that is a relief.${prompt};
So you lost the ointment! I suppose I can give you another. Please, deliver it as you said you would!${prompt};
Thank you so much. With more fiends in the woods, always my husband returns with scrapes and scratches. These are troubling days for us all.${prompt};
Here. It's not much, but please accept this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt};
Thank you again for your help!${prompt};
Ah, nobody wants to play games of chance these days.${prompt};
What? Those blokes at the Carpenters' Guild are looking for me, are they?${prompt};
I'll tell you what. We'll play a game of chance, and if you win I'll go see them.${prompt};
My name's Varchet. People call me the gambler. Would you care to play a game of chance with me?${prompt};
It's five gil per game. Pay your bet up front.${prompt};
That's your bet! Now we play!${prompt};
What will you play with?;
${selection-lines};
Dual dice.;
Odd-even dice.;
No dice!${prompt};
We both roll two dice, and the higher score wins! Even scores are a draw, of course.${prompt};
ツインダイスか？　よし。;
お互い2つのダイスを振りあって、;
出た目の合計が多かった方の勝ちだ。;
ただし同じ数だったらドロー。いいな？${prompt};
Have a go at it?;
${selection-lines};
Let's roll!;
No, thanks.${prompt};
（The hard way.）${prompt};
（The not-so-hard way.）${prompt};
I'll roll first! It's a ${number: 0} and a ${number: 1} for a total of ${number: 2}. Now it's your turn!${prompt};
Looks like a ${number: 3} and a ${number: 4} for ${number: 5} in all. That beats my ${number: 2}. Here's 10 gil.${prompt};
Hmm, ${number: 3} and ${number: 4} make ${number: 5}, but it doesn't beat my ${number: 2}.${prompt};
You lose your bet of 5 gil.${prompt};
That's ${number: 3} and ${number: 4} for ${number: 5} in all. You've tied me at ${number: 2}! Take your money back.${prompt};
What a shame. I hope you come back around to play sometime. I never turn down a game of chance!${prompt};
奇遇なダイスか？　よし。;
俺が2つのダイスを振る。出た目の合計が、;
奇数か偶数か。予想が的中すれば、お前さんの;
勝ちだ。どうだ、やってみるか？${prompt};
よし。じゃあ「奇数」か「偶数」か。;
お前さんの予想は？${prompt};
${selection-lines};
奇数;
偶数${prompt};
${choice: 3}[偶数/奇数]か。;
よし、ダイスを振るぜ。それっ！${prompt};
予想は${choice: 3}[偶数/奇数]だったから、;
お前さんの勝ちだ。やるじゃねぇか。;
10ギルお持ち帰りだ。ほらよっ！${prompt};
予想は${choice: 3}[偶数/奇数]か。;
こいつぁ惜しかったな。だが負けは負けだ。${prompt};
As promised, I shall go and see about those woodchippers. Maybe we can play another game later.${prompt};
Greetings!${prompt};
Begging your pardon, but I'm busy. I must make a cloak for Prince ${choice: 4}[Trion/Pieuje], and within the day!${prompt};
Is the master in?${prompt};
What is it? I said I'm busy, and I meant it!${prompt};
I've been sent by Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion] to pay for the cloak he received from this establishment two days past.${prompt};
Ahh...ah! Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion] sent you? I beg your pardon!${prompt};
Here's payment in full. Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion] was quite pleased, you know. Said the quality was second to none.${prompt};
Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion] is too kind. His words do this shop great honor.${prompt};
I will relay your words to the prince. Now, I beg your leave.${prompt};
Now, where was I? Oh, no! This will not do! I took payment for the cloak but forgot to give him a receipt!${prompt};
And with this second one to finish, I've no time to carry a receipt over now!${prompt};
Perhaps you could help me! Would you take this receipt to Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion], in Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt};
Normally I'd do it myself, but if I don't finish this other cloak for Prince ${choice: 4}[Trion/Pieuje], my reputation is mud!${prompt};
How about it? Will you help?${prompt};
I thank you. Remember, it's for Prince ${choice: 4}[Pieuje/Trion]! The guards at the gate will take it for you, I should think.${prompt};
Take the receipt to Prince Pieuje at Chateau d'Oraguille. You have my thanks!${prompt};
Take the receipt to Prince Trion at Chateau d'Oraguille. You have my thanks!${prompt};
I...see.${prompt};
Oh, it's you again. Changed your mind? Will you run to the chateau for me?${prompt};
Hrmm... Now, this is interesting! It pays to keep an eye on the competition. Thanks for letting me know!${prompt};
So who is this envelope for? Prince Trion? Or Prince Pieuje?${prompt};
Who is it for?;
${selection-lines};
Prince Trion.;
Prince Pieuje.${prompt};
All right, I'll deliver it for you. We can't let you in looking like that! Wait here.${prompt};
I've delivered the envelope to Prince Trion. You're dismissed.${prompt};
I've delivered the envelope to Prince Pieuje. You're dismissed.${prompt};
Imbecile! That envelope was for Prince Trion, not Prince Pieuje! Such idiocy... Get out of here!${prompt};
Imbecile! That envelope was for Prince Pieuje, not Prince Trion! Such idiocy... Get out of here!${prompt};
Oh, and tell that tailor to send someone respectable next time!${prompt};
Ah, thanks for your help. It's not much, but please accept this as payment.${prompt};
You receive ${number: 0} more gil.${prompt};
Wh-what? You gave it to the wrong prince?${prompt};
That's what I get for sending a recruit... This is for your time. Take it and leave.${prompt};
What? They complained about your attire?${prompt};
Well, you really can't blame them... Listen, I know someone in the Tanners' Guild on the west side. She can help you.${prompt};
She's a Mithra by the name of Hanaa Punaa. Go talk to her, she'll fix you up.${prompt};
You've some business with me? Sorry, but I'm busy.${prompt};
What's that? My son? At the Parade Grounds? So that's where he is! Could you let him know I'll go as soon as I'm done?${prompt};
Thank you for your help. You have my gratitude.${prompt};
Please tell my son that I'll join him as soon as I'm done, so he's to stay right there.${prompt};
Ah, thanks for your help earlier. Children can be a handful sometimes.${prompt};
I am Hanaa Punaa, an apprrrentice at the Tanners' Guild.${prompt};
I drrream of becoming a tanner, but work experience is hard to come by these days.${prompt};
Greetings! How may I help you today?${prompt};
Oh, it's you again!${prompt};
If you bring me three ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I can make the same thing for you again. I sure could use the work!${prompt};
Really, I'd prrrefer more exotic skins to work with, but that would be too much to ask of a new recruit such as yourself. Maybe later...${prompt};
Something you need?;
${selection-lines};
Do you have any work for me?;
No, nothing.${prompt};
If you'd like to do some shopping, see the clerk inside the store.${prompt};
Work? Ah, perrrfect! I've just run out of skins. Perrrhaps you could collect some for me?${prompt};
Head to West Ronfaure and collect three ${item-plural: 0[2]}. I'll make something for you.${prompt};
Well? Will you collect the skins?${prompt};
Oh, I see. Well, if you change your mind, come by any time.${prompt};
Perrrfect! I'll be waiting for those three ${item-plural: 0[2]}, then. I can start as soon as you bring them!${prompt};
What about the ${item-plural: 0[2]}? I'll need three of them before I can make anything for you, sorry...${prompt};
What fine skins you've brrrought me! They smell so...tasty! But it won't do to eat one's materials, will it?${prompt};
Wait just a moment. I'll make something for you.${prompt};
Here you are! I think you'll find it worth the wait.${prompt};
Greetings.${prompt};
Greetings, and welcome to Raimbroy's Grocery. If you'd like to make a purchase, talk to someone at the counter upstairs.${prompt};
Hello there!${prompt};
Ah, Katharina! How are things at the Lion Springs?${prompt};
Maybe it's the weather, but we've been selling mulsum so fast, we can't keep up! We need another cask as soon as possible!${prompt};
A cask of mulsum, eh? All right, let me go check for one.${prompt};
Dear, dear... It looks like the one I gave you folks yesterday was the last of my stock! I'm fresh out, I am.${prompt};
Oh... Well, I have to get back now, but could you bring another one extra quick? Thanks!${prompt};
Well, that's a shame. I'll just have to find another, more willing adventurer.${prompt};
A cask of mulsum... I'm fresh out of honey, and my errand boy's home recovering from wounds he got at Ghelsba.${prompt};
Hrmm... Eh? An adventurer! Think you could bring me some honey? I'm short on help, you see.${prompt};
Well, thanks be to you! I'll need five ${item-plural: 0[2]}, if you think you can handle it.${prompt};
Just what I needed! Here's your payment, then.${prompt};
Hrmm... Still not enough, eh? Sorry to keep yanking you around like this, but do you think you could go bring me some more?${prompt};
I'll take five ${item-plural: 0[2]} and no less, any time you can bring them. Good luck!${prompt};
Ah, so you'll hunt down some ${item-plural: 0[2]} for me, then?${prompt};
Heh-heh! Like to know something truly stellar? The honey from those bees out on La Theine Plateau is the best!${prompt};
They call me the honey king of San d'Oria, so you know I can't be wrong! Yep, that's some of the best there is! One taste and you'll be buzzing for more!${prompt};
But you gotta watch out for those bees. They've got poison stingers and they tend to swarm, so be careful!${prompt};
What's that? Still no ${item-plural: 0[2]}? If I just had five, I could get to work...${prompt};
What's this? I thought I asked you to bring me five ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Now get cracking!${prompt};
Thanks again for your help.${prompt};
Take up a sword, my friend. I'll talk to you when you do, and no sooner.${prompt};
Friend, listen to me. It is not cogs nor levers nor even the mightiest of magicks that protect this kingdom of San d'Oria.${prompt};
No! We Elvaan live by the power of the sword alone. Our blades defend our borders.${prompt};
If you would strengthen your sword arm and learn something of the art, then accept my challenge. What say you?${prompt};
Accept his challenge?;
${selection-lines};
Accept.;
Refuse.${prompt};
As you wish. Come back when you've grown a spine.${prompt};
Ah, I see you have a stout heart. Now listen well!${prompt};
Go to King Ranperre's Tomb and bring back ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. How, you ask? Use your head. Now begone!${prompt};
Ah, I see I was right about you. You've proved your mettle today. Further tempering may forge you into a hero among adventurers.${prompt};
In recognition of your success, I offer this sword. Train diligently, and grow strong.${prompt};
You're a little too new at this to undertake my challenge. Train further, and return here once you feel ready.${prompt};
"This thing you have given me, it has no bearing on your task; I cannot accept it.${prompt}";
And who, pray tell, are you? I cannot take that for which I have not asked. Take it and be gone.${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you not? Surely you've heard of King Ranperre's Tomb.${prompt};
Heard of the tomb?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
The Tomb of King Ranperre lies under a slope far south of Eastgate.${prompt};
The tomb is the final resting place of the Dragon King of San d'Oria. It was constructed within a cave to protect it from thieves.${prompt};
Although the tomb is safe from pillagers, the caves shelter all manner of fiendish creatures.${prompt};
Indeed? Well, then...${prompt};
I am entrusted with the tomb's care. Not long ago I used to wash its stones and change the offering every day.${prompt};
But now that fiends have overrun the place, my work would require risking my life. No job is worth that!${prompt};
I decided not to return, but the Dragon King himself came to me in my dreams and spoke, “I am thirsty... Bring me water.”${prompt};
I would like to help him, at least by bringing him fresh water...${prompt};
I have a request. Would you go to the tomb and replace the offering there with fresh water?${prompt};
That is...unfortunate.${prompt};
Then you'll help? Excellent! Please take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} to King Ranperre's Tomb, and exchange it with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} you'll find there.${prompt};
To get to King Ranperre's Tomb, head out the Eastgate into East Ronfaure, then make your way south as far as you can go. You should find it before long.${prompt};
You've lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}？${prompt};
More ${item-singular: 0[2]} is readily available, but the question is how to carry it...${prompt};
I have no other waterskin to give you. That last one I received from the late queen herself...${prompt};
How about this: Take the waterskin from the gravestone in King Ranperre's Tomb, fill it in Southern San d'Oria, then take it back to the tomb.${prompt};
Consider it penance for losing the waterskin I gave you. Agreed? I bid you a safe journey.${prompt};
Fill waterskin with ${item-singular: 0[2]}, place it in the Dragon King's tomb, then return to me.${prompt};
Take the waterskin from gravestone in King Ranperre's Tomb, fill it in Southern San d'Oria, then return it to the tomb.${prompt};
You find a well.${prompt};
You fill the ${item-singular: 1[2]} with ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You don't need any more water.${prompt};
I don't recall asking for this.${prompt};
I thank you, kind adventurer. His Majesty, the late king, thanks you, too.${prompt};
It isn't much, but please accept this in return.${prompt};
Eh? What's happened to the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Please, you must bring it back to me!${prompt};
Have you brought the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? If you have, please give it to me. ${prompt};
Well, you lost the waterskin, but to travel to the late king's tomb and back is no mean feat. I commend you.${prompt};
I had thought to take the cost of the waterskin out of your compensation, but I cannot disregard the toil you've endured on my behalf. You deserve your full reward.${prompt};
Looking for work? Well, perrrhaps you could gather more skins for me?${prompt};
As an adventurer, you should appreciate the satisfaction you get from honing your skills day by day.${prompt};
I've been getting too many sheepskins of late, so perrrhaps you could bring me something else this time.${prompt};
I could make you a fine piece of leather, if you could provide three ${item-plural: 0[2]} from the Valkurm Dunes.${prompt};
Bring me three more ${item-plural: 0[2]}, and I'll be happy to craft you another!${prompt};
How unforrrtunate. You should know that goods made from ${item-singular: 0[2]} fetch a fine price.${prompt};
Excellent! I know you'll be pleased with the results. Watch out for those lizard teeth!${prompt};
Well, what about the ${item-plural: 0[2]}? I need thrrree of them to make anything.${prompt};
I'll still take sheepskins, too, so come back once you've got thrrree.${prompt};
You've brought them? Joy! You always bring the best skins, you know. You should work for me full-time!${prompt};
I was only joking. I'm sure you have plenty of things to do. Wait rrright here, and I'll get to work.${prompt};
It's finished! Rrreally, a good skin makes all the difference, I think you'll agree.${prompt};
Come back again!${prompt};
I'm not taking any more ${item-plural: 0[2]}, but I'm still taking all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} I can get, so brrring me more! In sets of three, if you please.${prompt};
Ah, you've come quite a way since last we met, I see. I believe you're ready for another task!${prompt};
I'd like you to go to Ordelle's Caves. You'll find the entrance in a valley on La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
Those caves are also called the “Body Caves.” Know you why?${prompt};
It is because the caves are shaped much like the body of a person. You are acquainted with its structure, yes?${prompt};
Where in a body would lie the belly, in the caves flows a waterfall of much beauty. I want you to visit the waterfall, and return hither.${prompt};
I want proof of your trip, however. Bring me something out from that place. You must choose something.${prompt};
Come to think of it, the time I sent another to the waterfall, he, too, had quite a hard time! Heh-heh.${prompt};
Proof that you went to the waterfall, eh? Hah! Old man Balasiel's got you running errands now, has he?${prompt};
I'll tell you, but don't say a word to the old man! Stand with your back to the waterfall, and look up at the ceiling of the cave. You'll see a shining stalactite.${prompt};
Bring ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} back and you'll be a real spelunker, you will.${prompt};
Eh? How to get the drop? Ah...right. It's odd, but I can't seem to remember how I did it. That was a long time ago, you see.${prompt};
Hmm... Maybe you could try reading up on it. I'm sure it's outlined somewhere.${prompt};
Ah, you're back, and in one piece! And you've brought proof of your trip to the waterfall. Well done!${prompt};
Here, a certificate to mark your accomplishment. Keep it always!${prompt};
When you've progressed further, visit me again. Next time, a thorough test of your mettle will be in order!${prompt};
You see a diary.${prompt};
Read diary?;
${selection-lines};
Read it.;
Leave it be.${prompt};
Read which page?;
${selection-lines};
On second thought, I'll pass.;
Page 1.;
Page 2.;
Page 3.${prompt};
Went to the grotto at Yughott yesterday. Aided an adventurer there who claimed to be on the Kingdom's duty.${prompt};
Why could it be that the fiends are increasing so evidently in number?${prompt};
I have visited many places, attempting to uncover the beastmen's plans, but never have I encountered such a creature.${prompt};
I saw him there at the entrance to the cave. Thankfully, he did not note my presence.${prompt};
He was the same as he has always been--both the good parts, and the bad.${prompt};
That reminds me, I saw the waterfall again. I remember when I was a squire in training, going to fetch ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, so long ago.${prompt};
A traveler told me the other day that a certain kind of moss can help alleviate severe coughs.${prompt};
Perhaps I shall gather some on my next patrol, to give to that child and his mother. I do not know how much I will be able to carry, however.${prompt};
If only there was someone who could deliver it in my stead...${prompt};
Hello, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]! How may I help ye today?${prompt};
How may I help?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me about moss.;
Tell me about cold balms.${prompt};
Eh? Moss to cure coughs?${prompt};
Why, that sounds like ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. A brew of that bitter moss clears up the whoopingest of coughs. I've used it meself!${prompt};
If ye need somethin' for coughs, bring me that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, and I'll make ye a brew for free.${prompt};
Where does ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} grow, ye ask? Well, my mother used to tell me it grew near an abbey, but I don't recall where that was.${prompt};
What to do? I was trying to go up that plank over the barricade and I slipped and fell! That thing's a public hazard--all wet and mossy like that.${prompt};
It's dark and damp under there.${prompt};
There's lots of moss growing here.${prompt};
This place, it's like a maze! Then again, I got lost in my own backyard once...${prompt};
Oooh! This is it! This is the moss! I'll make a fine ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with this. Wait a moment, dearie.${prompt};
Here ye are, a fine ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! I hope it'll be of some use.${prompt};
There ye go, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}'s yours. May it do some good.${prompt};
The brew I gave ye, did it work? Come and see me again if ye ever need any help, dearie.${prompt};
This...<cough>...This is ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! But, I cannot accept something so precious without pay...paying!${prompt};
But I have little money. Here, this belonged to my late husband. Perhaps it will be of some use to you.${prompt};
Thank you for your help. My condition has much improved, thanks to you!${prompt};
An adventurer, eh? The shopkeeper here is looking for someone like you.  She's right up those stairs.${prompt};
Dear, dear me. If only an adventurer would help me...${prompt};
I received an order for votive talismans from the cathedral. But I have no ${item-plural: 0[2]} to make them!${prompt};
Would you be so kind as to go to Jugner Forest and collect three fangs from forest tigers there?${prompt};
Every three fangs you bring me, I can fill an order. It would mean a lot to me!${prompt};
So you'll go, then? My thanks to you. Remember, Jugner Forest is teeming with forest tigers. They can be a little rough, so tread carefully!${prompt};
Oh, so you won't go? Well, it could be dangerous, after all. But come back when you're ready to tromp on some tigers!${prompt};
What? You forgot my request, did you? Three ${item-plural: 0[2]} from Jugner Forest! Forest tigers' fangs grow long, and there are plenty of tigers there.${prompt};
Ah! Thank you, thank you. That's three ${item-plural: 0[2]}... I'll buy the lot.${prompt};
Bring me three more, and I'll be happy to take them. You just drop by and we'll do business, eh?${prompt};
What's this, then? I need three ${item-plural: 0[2]} before I'll buy them off you. Store policy, you see.${prompt};
I am Taumila, the owner of this establishment. Talk to the lady behind the counter if you wish to make a purchase.${prompt};
Hello! Let Taumila's handle all your sundry needs!${prompt};
Welcome, customer. Please have a look.${prompt};
（ここでショップメニュー）${prompt};
Welcome, welcome! Either of my attendants will be happy to help you!${prompt};
Ah, that reminds me. There was a message from Brugaire, about whether those weapons they ordered had come in.${prompt};
What? The Brugaire Consortium? Oh, dear. I just checked our storehouse, and we've nowhere near the stock we need to make the shipment.${prompt};
Perhaps we can get what we need from a free trader?${prompt};
A free trader, eh? Hmm... I know the man to ask. All we need now is someone to go ask him for us...${prompt};
How about you? You look like the adventuring type. We need help filling an order. Of course, we would compensate you accordingly.${prompt};
A customer has ordered a large amount of weaponry, but we're without the stock to fill it. We need someone to procure the remainder from a free trader.${prompt};
Then you'll do it? Much obliged! Listen well, and I'll explain what you're to do.${prompt};
A free trader named Alexius often passes through Jugner Forest. He's one of our suppliers of weapons.${prompt};
Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Alexius, and he'll give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange. Bring that back here.${prompt};
Alexius is a free spirit as well as a free trader, so you'll need to comb the forest for him.${prompt};
Eh? You won't do it? That's a shame. Well, come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
It's an urgent order, so go as soon as you can. Remember, give the order to the free trader Alexius in Jugner Forest.${prompt};
You've returned, and with the receipt! Splendid. Thanks to you, we can make the consortium happy!${prompt};
Here's a payment for your services. Mind you use it well!${prompt};
Ah, the adventurer returns! Thank you for your help. I shudder to think what might have happened if you hadn't come along.${prompt};
He's back again...${prompt};
Comes in every day to look, but never to buy! Word is he's a Royal Knight, and that he's quite a weapons enthusiast.${prompt};
They say whenever he's off duty he just leaves his kid and scours the weapon shops... Even I would tire of them before long!${prompt};
Welcome to Helbort's Blades!${prompt};
（ここにショップメニュー）${prompt};
Oh, the gleam! Such brilliance! Blades wrought by the master here are indeed a cut above. I must have one...${prompt};
Ah, that sword there... What a beauty she is!${prompt};
Of course, I could take both... No, I cannot! The wife's tongue is sharper than any blade.${prompt};
The latest pieces truly are works of art. I could just sell the sword I have now and... No! I must stop!${prompt};
Ah... That one's a two-hander, if I'm not mistaken. It's a bit pricey, but no need to buy a shield, right? It...It's tempting!${prompt};
Oh, I forgot! I was to buy a fishing rod for Ailbeche. Hmm... Well, he can wait.${prompt};
Ah, how far you've come since we last spoke. I expected no less of you.${prompt};
I have one last task for you, if your heart is ready.${prompt};
Are you prepared?;
${selection-lines};
I'm ready.;
I need to think about it.${prompt};
I see, and I respect your decision. My tasks are not to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Yes, in fact, I have sent many on this task, and many have failed...${prompt};
All so confident when they set out... Though some never returned.${prompt};
Sometimes, you must be the judge of your own strength, for none other can take your true measure.${prompt};
If you deem your skills still too crude, polish them and come back when you feel you are ready. I will be here, waiting.${prompt};
Excellent. This will be your last task, then. I entrust you with this book. Everything else is up to you.${prompt};
The way of the sword is the way of action! Now, go!${prompt};
Nothing to report!${prompt};
Have you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Great. Here, have this. Figure the rest out by yourself.${prompt};
The trial is difficult, but those who pass may become true knights. Good luck to you.${prompt};
I heard you did well. I am sure you'll make an excellent knight.${prompt};
Do you have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Excellent. Here, take this. The rest you must figure out for yourself.${prompt};
You may not know what to do, but do not fret. You have all the time you need.${prompt};
You've done well. I knew you would from the moment I saw you.${prompt};
You've completed your task with flying colors. You are ready to become a knight, I believe.${prompt};
This is my gift to you, to commemorate this occasion. Accept it with easy heart, for you have earned it!${prompt};
You can now become a paladin!${prompt};
Let your heart be your guide, but always keep a clear mind. Good luck.${prompt};
What's that?  Need something for a cold, eh?${prompt};
I can make medicines if need be, but ye'll have to fetch me the ingredients.${prompt};
Fetch the ingredients?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
No way.${prompt};
What's that? And here I was, looking forward to make medicine for ye. Well, if ye change yer mind, let me know.${prompt};
Very well, very well. I've written a list of what I'll be needing, so take it with ye.${prompt};
Come back when ye've got it all. I'll make a draught to cure the wickedest of colds, I will.${prompt};
Ye've brought what I asked for? Very well. Wait ye here a second while I brew the medicine.${prompt};
Here, yer medicine is done! Give this to one who's ailing and he'll be dancing in the streets a day later, guaranteed! Hee hee.${prompt};
Take that medicine over quick as you can now, dearie. Wouldn't want it to go bad.${prompt};
Oh, it's you again, dearie. Let me know if you ever need more medicine. I'll be here.${prompt};
Now, dearie! I expect better from ye, I do! Didn't mind the list, eh? I'll need every ingredient before I can help ye!${prompt};
You've become quite the adventurer, haven't you?${prompt};
Perhaps it's time for me to take on a challenge, too? Make something rrreally high-class... I know!${prompt};
Big cats live in the Jugner Forest: forest tigers. I want you to bring me some of their hides. And don't worry, we're not related!${prompt};
Bring me thrrree ${item-plural: 0[2]} and I'll make you something special. How about it?${prompt};
If you bring me thrrree more ${item-plural: 0[2]} I'll make more of the same, so drop in anytime!${prompt};
That's rrreally too bad. Did you know that ${item-singular: 0[2]} goods sell for a pretty gil at the market?${prompt};
That's great! I'll get right to work as soon as you bring the thrrree ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Good luck.${prompt};
Hey! What about the ${item-plural: 0[2]}? I'll need thrrree before I can get to work!${prompt};
I still need sheepskins and lizard skins, too! Bring thrrree anytime and I'll make you something.${prompt};
Oooh! That was fast. You always do such good work! And that lets me do good work, too!${prompt};
Wait right there. With these I should be able to make something really classy. Be rrright back!${prompt};
Sorry for the wait. Look! The quality of the hide really shows through, don't you think? Fine work, if I may say so myself!${prompt};
Come again anytime. It's a rrreal pleasure doing business with you!${prompt};
My name is Hinaree. I lost my husband many years ago, and now I live in this mansion all alone.${prompt};
He was a kind man, and he gave me all the comforts I could ask for. It is very lonely, living in this big house without him...${prompt};
Do you believe in Paradise? It is a place without fear or death. Ah, it is truly a wondrous place!${prompt};
Once there, I could surely see my husband again. I know it!${prompt};
I wanted to take my usual donation to the cathedral today. But I have a visitor, and cannot leave.${prompt};
Perhaps someone could deliver this donation in my stead?${prompt};
Could I ask you to do this for me? Arnau, the vicasque, is there. Would you deliver this envelope to him?${prompt};
Then you accept my request? I thank you, kind adventurer.${prompt};
Here then is the envelope. Please hand it to Vicasque Arnau at the cathedral.${prompt};
There is a great deal of money in that envelope. Please take care not to misplace it along the way!${prompt};
I see... That is unfortunate. I did intend to compensate you, but you must be very busy. I'll find someone else.${prompt};
Have you delivered the offering? Remember, hand it only to Vicasque Arnau at the cathedral, and take care not to lose it!${prompt};
You found Vicasque Arnau and he took my donation? Thank you so much!${prompt};
Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt};
Thank you again for taking my donation to the cathedral for me.${prompt};
<cough>...<cough!>${prompt};
Who are you? If you're looking for my son, he's out making deliveries.${prompt};
Mother! I'm home!${prompt};
Raminel! B-back from work so soon?${prompt};
I was passing through, so I wanted to stop by and see how you were. You should be in bed resting, Mother.${prompt};
Oh, I'm...fine, really... You shouldn't...shouldn't worry...about me so much.${prompt};
You're not fine, Mother! You should stay in bed until I save enough money, and get you the medicine for your Davoi-fever.${prompt};
Oh, Raminel, you're too kind...too kind to me!${prompt};
I have to make a few more deliveries. Get your rest, Mother.${prompt};
I'm sorry... What were we talking about?${prompt};
What were we talking about?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me about your son.;
Tell me about yourself.;
Do you have any other family?${prompt};
I can't move about much on account--on account of my illness, so Raminel does his delivery work to support us.${prompt};
The physician told me I have--have the Davoi-fever: a disease that attacks the lungs, only found in this part of the world.${prompt};
"Do not worry, it isn't contagious; I still live with my son, after all. But I can't--I can't stop coughing!${prompt}";
Long ago, I was a sister in the abbey at Davoi.${prompt};
But one day, Orcs raided the village--a great army. They took the abbey, and I...no, all of the sisters, were driven from our home.${prompt};
I heard later that the abbey had fallen into ruin. I would not wish to see it now, for fear my heart would break...${prompt};
I dwell here with my son Raminel. My husband passed away five years ago.${prompt};
You know, many Elvaan once lived in Davoi. But the village fell into ruin after the Great War of twenty years ago. An illness called the Davoi-fever spread amongst the survivors.${prompt};
Fleeing the fires of war, refugees from Davoi poured into San d'Oria, but for the ones with the Davoi-fever, there was no escape.${prompt};
The fever is marked by violent coughing. Toward the end, the coughs become incessant, sapping the life from the victim until he dies.${prompt};
Thank goodness it is not contagious, but sadly there is no known cure.${prompt};
That's mine! Give it back!${prompt};
You're so selfish! I lent you something yesterday! When are you going to give it back?${prompt};
What are you two bickering about, eh?${prompt};
He took my sweets, and Mother always says that taking without asking is stealing!${prompt};
I'm not stealing! This brat won't give me back the toy I lent him!${prompt};
Now, boys... Toys and candies are temporary, but you'll be brothers your whole lives. Do you understand?${prompt};
Well, yes, but...${prompt};
So?${prompt};
So, there are many kinds of brothers in this world. Some get along, and others fight whenever they meet.${prompt};
Ah-choo!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Your Highness, have you caught cold?${prompt};
Aye, from my scheming brother Pieuje, no doubt.${prompt};
But someday you will need each other. Compared to the Great War twenty years ago, your squabbles are chocobo-feed!${prompt};
Hmm...maybe.${prompt};
I suppose...${prompt};
I hear of battle in lands abroad. What if another war came, and fiends knocked through these walls? You'd forget your quarreling, then!${prompt};
You really think fiends will attack?${prompt};
Fiends don't scare me!${prompt};
Heh-heh! That's the spirit! Grow strong, my boys! You'll be out slaying beastmen soon enough!${prompt};
When I grow up, I'm going to go fight the fiends, just like Prince Trion!${prompt};
My brother always takes my sweets! It's not fair!${prompt};
Wait! If I had magic, maybe I could keep my brother's hands off my sweets...${prompt};
Just head west down this street and take a right at the end of it. That will lead you to Watchdog Alley.${prompt};
It now serves as a residential area for our kingdom's squires, so it's quite safe. But it was once a haven for criminals and all sorts of sordid types.${prompt};
During the Great War the quarter was even used for the public hangings of captured beastmen. To think...${prompt};
Here's your delivery!${prompt};
Thank you!${prompt};
Sorry, I have deliveries to make!${prompt};
Tour the city astride one of our fine chocobos! Only 200 gil!${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
Pay 200 gil.;
Think about it.${prompt};
Thank you, thank you! And now, off to see the sights of San d'Oria!${prompt};
Oh... You don't have enough gil. Come back when your pockets are better lined, eh?${prompt};
You lose ${number: 0} gil!${prompt};
Accept?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not right now.${prompt};
Accept?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
I'm sorry.${prompt};
Hey! If you've no business with me, I ask that you depart at once!${prompt};
Really, you see, I'm a clown. Know why? Because I'm funny!${prompt};
I am the great fire-eater! Braver of the Blaze! I'm just taking a little break right now.${prompt};
I'm a mime. I'm on break right now, so let me be.${prompt};
I play the pipes. Which ones, you ask? The only ones! Bagpipes! Just not when I'm on break.${prompt};
I am Hinaree. I live here in this mansion all alone.${prompt};
Greetings! Don't ask for mulsum, 'cause I'm afraid we're right out.${prompt};
Welcome, weary traveler. Make yourself at home!${prompt};
La-dee-dah, la-dee-dah... Sure am bored. Wish there was some work to do.${prompt};
You an adventurer? Name's Chanpau, but me friends call me “Champ!” I may be a bum now, but back in the day, I was a right Royal Knight, I was...${prompt};
Eh? There's work, you say! I'll go check it out, then. Cargo room B down at the port? Thanks!${prompt};
Thanks for the tip! I'll be heading down there later on. Cargo room B, right?${prompt};
Ah, it's you again... I tried out that job you told me about, but I got meself fired in only a day!${prompt};
Sorry about that, eh? If you ever hear of another job, you let me know! I won't let you down again!${prompt};
"I'm busy brewing a powerful potion, dearie. Got to tend the flame; no time for chatting.${prompt}";
That's odd. My husband's late. He's still at the port auction house, waiting for some ingredients to arrive...${prompt};
Why, hello! I am Ailevia. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Learning your way around can be daunting at first, but take your time and you'll be fine.${prompt};
Should you get lost, check the “Map” from the main menu. Now, I'm supposed to give you this in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is Southern San d'Oria. I know a thing or two about these streets.${prompt};
Would you like to learn about this area?;
${selection-lines};
I'm interested.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
To the north stands Victory Arch. Carved from its two mighty pillars are statues that represent the two orders: the Temple Knights and the Royal Knights.${prompt};
Northern San d'Oria lies beyond, where you'll find Chateau d'Oraguille, the cathedral, and the consulates of our allies.${prompt};
West is Pikeman's Way, where you'll find shops, grocers, and the Tanners' Guild. Across from the stalls is the Westgate, which leads outside.${prompt};
East is Cavalry Way, where you'll find armor and weapon shops as well as a tavern. The residential area lies at the end.${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen of San d'Oria! Troupe Valeriano is here to celebrate your glorious deeds in battle!${prompt};
Oh, a fellow outsider! We are Troupe Valeriano. I am Valeriano, at your service!${prompt};
Watch this.${prompt};
I worry for Bastok... Our Hume leaders rely too much on technology.${prompt};
To be honest, I'm not fond of San d'Orians. Tall and snooty but misers through and through! May their conquests fall flat!${prompt};
What a huge city-witty! San d'Oria towers above the other nations! How can they possibly competaru?${prompt};
The food arrround here's not bad, but our Windurstian chefs could do better. If they could only get hold of the same ingrrredients!${prompt};
Nobody tops my trrricks. Stand back if you value your ears and moustaches!${prompt};
San d'Oria owes its victories to the Elvaan.${prompt};
Shhh.${prompt};
Er, hey! You're not the captain! Don't scare me like that, really.${prompt};
It is locked.${prompt};

You stand beneath Victory Arch. Beyond lies Northern San d'Oria. The tale of its magnificence stretches back some 300 years to the era of Warking Acheufagais.${prompt};
The arch stands impervious, unfelled even by the great chaos brought about by the Civil and Crystal Wars. It is precisely this permanence that has made the Victory Arch the pride of the Royal Army!${prompt};
Beyond the arch lies Northern San d'Oria, where Chateau d'Oraguille, the cathedral, and the consulates of allied nations stand.${prompt};
Yes?${prompt};
You stand before the Westgate. West Ronfaure lies beyond.${prompt};
You stand before the Eastgate. East Ronfaure lies beyond.${prompt};
Oh, an adventurer. Across the way lies the Westgate. It leads outside the city walls.${prompt};
Welcome to Novice's Hall. Don't be afraid, come inside!${prompt};
Are you lost? I know this neighborhood well.${prompt};
Which way are you going?;
${selection-lines};

Right.${prompt};
There on Pikeman's Way you can find a grocer, sundries and the Tanners' Guild. At the end lies the mansion of Count Caffaule.${prompt};
Go up those stairs for Watchdog Alley. Homes of townsfolk line the street.${prompt};
I'm looking for a former examiner. I heard he lived around here...${prompt};
You've never heard of examiners? Look, in order to become a knight, you have to pass a trial. The examiners judge your worth.${prompt};
But Southern San d'Oria's streets are so confusing. I hear they were built this way to thwart invaders!${prompt};
Say, I found the examiner I was looking for! But he would only talk of taking up the sword. Why won't he test me?${prompt};
The examiner finally offered me a task. He wants ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but he won't tell me how to get one! Keeps saying I should use my head...${prompt};

${color-alt: 15}${name-player} points to the item in ${name-npc}'s hand.;
Oh, this? It's a magical shell called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
You want to know about ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
Let me tell you all about them!${prompt};
What do you want to ask?;
${selection-lines};
What's ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?;
What types of ${item-plural: 1[2]} are there?;
How do you use them?;
Never mind.${prompt};
These magic shells are full of mysteries...${prompt};
You can get beautiful pearls from them.;
Some say these are some new form of shall shells, but...${prompt};
Even if you take out a pearl, they make more and more of them.;
Strange, isn't it?${prompt};
What's more strange is that pearls taken from the same shell actually transmit sound, no matter how far apart they are!${prompt};
So, if you speak into one of the pearls, people who hold other pearls or the shell they were made from can hear you!${prompt};
"It's as if they were linked by an invisible thread... Huh. I guess that's why they have ""link"" in their names.${prompt}";
So anyway, the shells are called ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and the pearls ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
There are also different types of ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Is there anything else you want to know?;
What do you want to ask about?;

${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are ${item-plural: 1[2]} when you first buy them at the store.${prompt};

You can set the color and name of your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you open it. Make sure to set the ones you like because you can't change them afterwards!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} are ${item-plural: 0[2]} that have been opened and function as a communications tool.${prompt};
They're like the party leader of an adventuring party.${prompt};
All items created by your ${item-singular: 1[2]} retain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}'s color and name.${prompt};
Make the name something unique so that it's easy to remember.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are pearls that ${item-plural: 1[2]} make.${prompt};
If you equip one, you can communicate with people who have the same ${item-plural: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 1[2]} they were made from.${prompt};
They're like the party members in an adventuring party.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} is a bag full of ${item-plural: 2[2]}. You can make one by metamorphosing a ${item-singular: 2[2]} for that purpose.${prompt};
It won't have all the features of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, but you can take out an endless amount of ${item-plural: 2[2]} like ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
You have to use ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to make ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. The same goes if you want to turn it back into ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
They're like the party leaders of an alliance of adventuring parties...${prompt};
You want to know how to use them?;
Where should I start?${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Where to get one.;
Assigning a color and name.;
Making ${item-plural: 2[2]}.;
Equipping them.;
Speaking into them.;
Metamorphosing ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Throwing them away.;
Back.${prompt};
You can buy ${item-plural: 1[2]} in shops. They're a little pricey, though.${prompt};
It might be best if you ask friends who want pearls to chip in.${prompt};
A freshly bought ${item-singular: 0[2]} has neither a color nor a name.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} becomes usable only after you've chosen its color and given it a name. Then you can use it to make ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
You can combine different amounts of blue, red, and green to make your shell's color.;
You can only use alphabet letters for the name, but you can use capital and lowercase letters anywhere you want.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are made from ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Making them is easy. Just equip your ${item-singular: 1[2]}, then go to “Linkshell” in the menu and select “Create Pearl”!${prompt};
All ${item-plural: 2[2]} made this way retain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}'s color and name, so it's easy to tell who can hear you!${prompt};
You can make as many ${item-plural: 2[2]} as you want, whenever you want, so don't worry about making too many of them!${prompt};
You can also make ${item-plural: 2[2]} with ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} the same way.${prompt};
Oh, and...you use your ${item-singular: 1[2]} to make ${item-plural: 3[2]}, too, but it's a little complicated so I'll tell you later.${prompt};
You have to equip ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for it to have any effect.${prompt};
Go to “Linkshell” from the menu, choose the ${item-singular: 1[2]} you want to equip, and you're all ready to go.${prompt};
It's a little different from equipping weapons and armor.${prompt};
After you've done this, an icon that represents what you've equipped will appear beside your name. This is where the color you chose becomes visible.${prompt};
If someone “checks” you in this state, they will be able to see the name of the ${item-singular: 1[2]} you have on.${prompt};
Follow the same steps to equip ${item-plural: 2[2]} and ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};
To speak into ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, change your chat mode to “linkshell,” and whatever you say will be heard by everyone who has the same “link.”${prompt};
You can also type “/linkshell” and type your message. The shorter version is “/l” (lowercase “L” for “linkshell”).${prompt};
Ah, but of course, you have to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]} equipped first.${prompt};
Whatever you say will only be heard by people who have the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]} with the same link.${prompt};
So if you want to stop listening to your link, all you have to do is unequip your ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} can metamorphose other people's ${item-plural: 2[2]} and ${item-plural: 3[2]}. Of course, it can only affect those that were made from the same ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
There are two types of metamorphoses, which are:;
1: Make into sack / Make into pearl;
2: Kick.${prompt};
Both need the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} or ${item-singular: 3[2]} to be equipped at the time.${prompt};
“Make into sack / Make into pearl” makes the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} and vice-versa.${prompt};
It's useful if you want someone else to take care of handing out ${item-plural: 2[2]} in your place.${prompt};
“Kick” actually breaks the link with the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} or ${item-singular: 3[2]} and turns it into junk.${prompt};
Once kicked, the ${item-singular: 2[2]} will become broken and unusable...;
Only use this in extreme cases!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 3[2]} can also be used to “kick” but they can only affect ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]} are normal items, so they can be thrown away easily.${prompt};
But as normal items, you'll lose them permanently if you throw them away.${prompt};
It won't really matter if it's ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, but throwing away ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is not a good idea!${prompt};
Oh, are you sure?;
Well, if you ever have any questions about ${item-plural: 1[2]} you know where to find me!${prompt};
(So anyway, as I was saying...);
I am the theologian Adaunel. I'm now examining this map of the sky for heresies by that so-called “astronomer” of Windurst!${prompt};
Perhaps you could assist me. Why, to spend ten years scrawling all this rubbish... What a dull place Windurst must be!${prompt};
Look at the star map?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I blame you not! Why, were the stars not fixed upon the celestial sphere, they would fall from the sky! Everyone knows that!${prompt};
Then, take a deep breath, for sinister signs may lurk between the lines of this “map.”${prompt};
It's all pagan myth, you see. Look, lightning from the hand of “Ramuh” in the southwest spawns the “Bomb” of fire!${prompt};
The angry gods call “Leviathan” from the western sea to put it out, washing away civilization... Or so that Windurstian claims.${prompt};
I cannot abide the belief that Vana'diel, blessed of Altana herself, is just another dot in the sky! I'll debunk all this at the next symposium.${prompt};
Hrmm... Good eyes, friend. I thought my presence unknown, but you found me.${prompt};
You are fortunate... For my knowledge of the enemy, culled from many years on the battlefield, can be yours.${prompt};
Look at the tattered diagram?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
“Know thy enemy, know thyself. A hundred battles, a hundred victories.” A great general of antiquity spoke these words.${prompt};
Good. Curiosity is a virtue! Look at my diagram, and listen well, for I shall say this but once.${prompt};
This is the law of relations: Beasts bare their fangs at dim-witted lizards, while the lizards must turn to the vapid vermin for their sup.${prompt};
The multitude of vermin crop plantoids close to the ground, while the long-lived plantoids draw nourishment from the corpses of beasts with their roots.${prompt};
Birds that wing the skies carry aquans to their graves, while water-wise aquans suck the shapeless forms of amorphs dry.${prompt};
The silent, shapeless amorphs slip into the nests of birds and feed on their feathery brood.${prompt};
And this is the law of oppositions: The cursed undead shun the pseudo-life of the arcana, while the arcana avoid the undead.${prompt};
The immortal dragons shun the death-bringing demons, while the demon spellweavers avoid dragons, against whom their magic is useless.${prompt};
All of this is different from the regular divisions of life, based upon my own experience and observation.${prompt};
Sharpen your senses, and watch your enemies closely. Soon, a world of understanding will open before you.${prompt};
Finding your way around Southern San d'Oria? You can look at my map if you'd like.${prompt};
Look at the map?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Here in the center lies Victory Square. West is Pikeman's Way and Watchdog Alley, where you'll find the Tanners' Guild and Taumila's Sundries.${prompt};
East is Cavalry Way and Squire Alley, with armor and weapons shops, and a tavern. The gate at the end leads to the housing area.${prompt};
Is that so? Pity.${prompt};
This is San d'Oria's South Auction House. Inquire at the service windows if you've goods to offer for auction.${prompt};
That lad Raminel runs parcels for us. Ever does he toil to support his ill mother. Why, it brings tears to my eyes!${prompt};
You're one of my favorite recruits, and always have given you new missions. But I must look after many more adventurers than just yourself.${prompt};
Henceforth, I must judge your worthiness for your next mission based on your rank points.${prompt};
In order to earn rank points, participate in our conquests, and thereby get crystals to give to the Temple Knight.${prompt};
If you want to know more about conquests, ask the Temple Knight who stands before any gate.${prompt};
If you want to send something to a friend's, or even your own Mog House, we are at your service. Please don't hesitate to ask.${prompt};
Send an item?;
${selection-lines};
Send something.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
Parcels delivered to rooms anywhere in Vana'diel!${prompt};
I can't accept stuff I haven't asked for yet. Listen to my rrrequest first, silly!${prompt};
Well done, ${name-player}! You have my--nay--all of our gratitude. With this, our Kingdom of San d'Oria will surely know peace at last.${prompt};
Like ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Hello!${prompt};

${selection-lines};

No, thanks.${prompt};

Well, what sort of armor would you like?${prompt};
We want to sell produce from Norvallen, but the entire region is under foreign control!${prompt};
We specialize in Ronfaure produce, but we cannot import from that region without a strong San d'Orian presence there.${prompt};
I'd be making a killing selling produce from Zulkheim, but the region's under foreign control!${prompt};
I'd love to import produce from Gustaberg, but the foreign powers in control there make me feel unsafe!${prompt};

Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly.;
I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.${prompt};
You've earned conquest points!${prompt};
You've received your nation's Signet.;
You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!${prompt};
I am ${name-npc}, a Temple Knight.;
I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.${prompt};

${choice: 0}[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.];
I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F.;
I want to go on a supplies quest.;
I have some questions...;
Nothing, sorry to bother you.${prompt};
What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Conquests.;
Conquest results.;
Donating crystals.;
Conquest points.;
The effects of controlling regions.;
Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};
Where do you wish to take the supplies?;

We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations.;
Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.${prompt};
We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign.;
You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.${prompt};
Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race!;
Here is a small token of our appreciation.${prompt};
Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.${prompt};
You cannot currently purchase this item.;
Please choose another.${prompt};
Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.${prompt};
Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of ${number: 5} members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.${prompt};
Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.${prompt};
There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.${prompt};
Join the E.F. in ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?;

Join the E.F.;
Not this time.${prompt};
Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.${prompt};
One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.${prompt};
One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.${prompt};
One of your party members is below level ${number: 6}. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.${prompt};
I see that you are ready.;
I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.${prompt};
Are you ready to be teleported to ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.${prompt};
Teleport to ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?;

Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.${prompt};
You received ${number: 1} conquest points!${prompt};
When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.${prompt};
I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties.;
Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.${prompt};
You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.${prompt};
The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.${prompt};
You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!${prompt};
Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.${prompt};
We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.${prompt};
Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt};
You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt};
Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt};
Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt};
Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt};
Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt};
Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt};
Your inventory is full. You could not accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.${prompt};

Actually, I have a problem. I heard from an adventurer that my signposts were stained by foul weather recently, and with all the dangers out there...${prompt};
I was wondering if you might help. If you could just clean the four signposts in Jugner Forest for me... Of course, I'd pay you for your time.${prompt};
Will you clean the signposts?;
${selection-lines};
Let's get to work!;
Not now.${prompt};
You'll clean them? That's great news, indeed! Remember, there are four signposts in Jugner Forest that need cleaning.${prompt};
I see... Hopefully, no one will lose their way on account of unreadable signposts!${prompt};
There are four signposts that need cleaning, all of them in Jugner Forest. Much obliged!${prompt};

Right away, my lady.${prompt};
This is an order for some goldsmithing work. Give it to one who's skilled in the art. And I'm not talking about some two-bit adventurer!${prompt};
And Humes really lack the required touch, wouldn't you agree? No, I want you to find an Elvaan goldsmith to fill this order.${prompt};
That's my request.${prompt};
You should be able to find an Elvaan goldsmith in Bastok, named--${prompt};
Rouva! Be silent!${prompt};
So, you found a goldsmith? Well, it's no masterpiece, but I suppose this will have to do.${prompt};
Rouva, see that this adventurer is rewarded.${prompt};
Was the Lady Michea well? Lady Femitte has been quite concerned about her, you know.${prompt};
Lady Michea's parents passed away, and then Lady Michea herself went missing... Lady Femitte spent weeks trying to find her.${prompt};
When she did find her, she tried to bring her back to San d'Oria, but Lady Femitte's relatives wouldn't have a child raised by Galka among them...${prompt};
Of course, Lady Femitte, who was already the head of the family at such a young age, wouldn't accept their...${prompt};
Rouva! That's enough!${prompt};
Here is your payment. Please, give our best regards to Lady Michea. Tell her Lady Femitte cried tears of bitter regret that day...${prompt};
While a few San d'Orians choose the life of an adventurer, the rest of us hide behind these walls, clinging to outdated traditions.${prompt};
My lady is concerned about San d'Oria's future. She's worried how much we are bound to ceremony.${prompt};
Of course, the convergence of old and new has always been part of who we are, hasn't it?${prompt};
You an adventurer? I have a job for you... If you could bring me ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, I'd be much obliged.${prompt};
I'm still in the market for ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, you know! I'll buy them by the lot!${prompt};
What say you?;
${selection-lines};
I shall help.;
I cannot.${prompt};
I knew I could count on you. Bring me ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, then.${prompt};
So be it. Let me know if you change your mind.${prompt};
Still I await ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!${prompt};
Thank you for the help. If you are interested, I always need more.${prompt};
Say, would you have any time on your hands? I require ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, and I never seem to have enough of them.${prompt};

I shall help.;
No, I cannot.${prompt};
Excellent! Then I'll be waiting. Remember, it's ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, what a pity. Maybe next time, then?${prompt};
Where are the ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} you promised?${prompt};
Thank you so much! Here's something in return.${prompt};
I cannot seem to sleep recently. It's like I've forgotten how! Why, last night, I counted at least fifty-thousand sheep... I must be getting old, eh?${prompt};
I've heard that drinking ${item-plural: 0[2]} would help. Think you could bring me one? I would be ever so grateful.${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not now.${prompt};
Ah, that's a great help. I know you can get ${item-plural: 0[2]} from Stray Mary, so if you find her... Good luck!${prompt};
Ah, that's a shame. I had hoped to sleep untroubled...${prompt};
I hear Stray Mary carries ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Thanks a gillion.${prompt};
Thank you! My snoring will express gratitude mere words cannot! Here's something for you in return.${prompt};
Soon I will sleep again. Thank you, kind adventurer.${prompt};
I slept like a wet-eared yearling! And the dreams! Well, I won't relate them, lest you get jealous, eh? Thank you!${prompt};
Hmm... ${name-player}, you say? No, never heard that name. Do not expect me to learn the name of every recruit!${prompt};
Do good for the Kingdom and her people, and they shall come to know you.${prompt};
Once you have their trust, they will request your help more readily. Just keep your head down, and your day shall come.${prompt};
${name-player}...? Hmm... I might have heard that name before. Then again, maybe not.${prompt};
You are not famous yet. Keep your nose to the grindstone and work for the people. Soon, they will know you better!${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. That is a name I often hear. People speak well of you!${prompt};
Your deeds for the Kingdom have earned you much honor.${prompt};
${name-player}! You have become well known in these parts!${prompt};
I hear much of your accomplishments. Keep up the good work, and greatness lies in your future.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}! You are famous in our kingdom!${prompt};
Of you no ill is spoken. Give to the Kingdom and she will give to you, no?${prompt};
${name-player}! I would venture that much the Kingdom has heard your name!${prompt};
And your reputation sparkles. Indeed I am proud of you. And to think I first knew you when you were a new recruit!${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. Practically all of the Kingdom has heard of you now.${prompt};
What's more, your reputation is stellar. I look forward to even greater things from you!${prompt};
${name-player}! People are talking about you! Every infant in his cradle knows your name!${prompt};
And they hold you in highest regard! I am so proud of you! May your kind deeds continue!${prompt};
Welcome to the auction house.;
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};
What do you want to know?;
${selection-lines};
What is the auction house?;
How are auctions run?;
Are there any fees?;
Are there any limits?;
How do you check up on merchandise?;
How do you remove an item?;
My “Sales Status” list is full!;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};
To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt};
Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt};
At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt};
Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt};
Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt};
In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt};
Vana'diel is abuzz with “Adventurer Appreciation” fever, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have prepared some nice little goodies and gathered lots of top-secret information on adventurer activity, kupo!;
Let me check my journal for your statistical data...${prompt};
There's your adventuring life in a nutshell!${prompt};
There's your adventuring life in a nutshell!;
And this time, there's an extra-special anniversary present involved! Oh, just be careful you don't accidentally throw it away or anything, because you'll never be able to get another one...ever, kupo!${prompt};
Take a look--and to think, you can select ${number: 0} more amazing anniversary items!${prompt};
Take a look--and to think, you can select ${number: 0} more amazing anniversary item!${prompt};
Which would you like? (${number: 0} remaining);
${selection-lines};

Ah, I understand. With some many goodies to choose from, it's no surprise that you'd want to think about it a bit more. I'll be here once you've decided, kupo.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
An excellent choice! I hope you enjoy your brand-new ${item-singular: 9[2]}!${prompt};
There's your adventuring life in a nutshell!;
And because it seems you're so eager to get your hands on some more goodies, I guess I could find it in my heart to spare another...but just for you, kupo!${prompt};
You have the choice to either receive your present now, or “wait” to build up the suspense, kupo!${prompt};
If you choose to wait, you might find yourself receiving an even better present, kupo.${prompt};
What will you do, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Lemme think, kupo.;
Gimme my present, kupo!;
I'll wait, kupo.${prompt};
Take all the time you need, and talk to me when you're ready, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your present, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopopo! A patient one!;
Let's see how long you can wait before the suspense finally gets to you, kupo!${prompt};

Master, Master!;
I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt};
Sleeping on that ${item-singular: 3[2]} has made me homesick, kupo.;
Will my benevolent master give ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?${prompt};
Give your moogle a vacation？;
${selection-lines};
Sure, kupo!;
No, your time is mine!${prompt};
Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!${prompt};
Thank you, kupo!;
I...have one more favor to ask.;
It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!${prompt};
Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} as a gift, kupo!${prompt};
Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} would make the perfect present, kupo!${prompt};
I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...${prompt};

Master!;
I'm back from my vacation, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!${prompt};

Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo!${prompt};

Master, Master!;
I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt};
After resting on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?${prompt};
Give your moogle some time off?;
${selection-lines};
Have fun, kupo!;
No, I am your only friend now!${prompt};
Oh, thank you, master!;
My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!${prompt};
The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} for my friends there, kupo!${prompt};
And my other buddies need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!${prompt};
I can't help out my friends if I don't have ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo...${prompt};
I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!${prompt};
Master!;
I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!${prompt};
We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome to the Lion Springs! Enjoy our selection of fine food and beverages.${prompt};
My apologies, but I've no time to talk.${prompt};
How dare you eavesdrop on me! What do you want?${prompt};
Now, now. Give it a rest, Sharz. I'm sure there is an explanation for this. Well, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]? Let's hear it.${prompt};
Oh, never mind. Say, you are a red mage, like me. I have a tale you may wish to hear, but I shall not tell it for free.${prompt};
Well, I've heard that in Davoi they store their riches in many different vaults. I seek to borrow ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from them, you see.${prompt};
Would you mind running this errand for me? Only then I shall tell you my tale. I guarantee it will be worth your while.${prompt};
Could you do this for me?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not right now.${prompt};
That's the spirit, my friend. Now, head to Davoi and search the Orcs' storage holes.${prompt};
The malicious Orcs dig false ones, and often move their treasure from hole to hole as well. Never assume it will stay in one place for long!${prompt};
Hmph. I pity the adventurer who shrinks before a challenge.${prompt};
Head to Davoi and search the Orcs' storage holes! The Orcs dig false ones, and often move their treasure from hole to hole. Never assume it will stay in one place for long!${prompt};
Excellent form, my friend. I am impressed.${prompt};
Well, I'll be! ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s got more talent than you, I dare say.${prompt};
My dear sir, will you not hush? I wish to tell my tale. First, are you the daring type?${prompt};
Are you daring?;
${selection-lines};
Of course I am.;
No, not really.${prompt};
Hmph. Only the meek say such things.${prompt};
Hmph. At least you're honest.${prompt};
At any rate, my tale takes place in the church. Something is sometimes sighted there.${prompt};
What is, you ask? How obtuse! I speak of course of a spirit, a ghost! Have you not felt it so, by the look of the interior there?${prompt};
So, after learning of the rumors, I went to investigate.${prompt};
The catacombs underneath the structure were so frightening, even I was taken aback.${prompt};
But it scared me not, for soon I paid it no heed.${prompt};
Well? Did you find it or not?${prompt};
Why, you--! Silence, please. At least until the end.${prompt};
Anyway, I thought I might as well say a prayer, so I walked before the altar.${prompt};
And then, I felt my skin crawl. I tried to spin around, but I could not move!${prompt};
Ever I felt it creep closer. But I heard not a footstep!${prompt};
Hmm.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Still I felt it draw closer, so I summoned all my strength to turn and look behind me.${prompt};
And I saw it right there! Right next to me!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Was it floating in the air?${prompt};
Yes, and not only that, it wore a fine suit of armor. Obviously it was no mortal person, for I could see right through it.${prompt};
Thank heavens you're alive!${prompt};
Yes, well... Ere long it disappeared, surrendering but a glimpse to me. Yet that was enough, for I knew who it was.${prompt};
It was Rainemard.${prompt};
Rainemard? Yes, I've heard that name. Say, he was a red mage, like you! Ah, those were the days...${prompt};
This is no time to reminisce! Have you forgotten how he died? Surely he has come for revenge.${prompt};
Come to think of it, Rainemard had a daughter, didn't he? What was her name again?${prompt};
Did he? That I did not know. Pray tell, Valdero, who was she?${prompt};
Oh... I can't remember. Many an age has passed since those days.${prompt};
I see. Well, so ends my tale. What, you didn't like it? Forgive me! Rarely are ghost stories told well. At any rate, this is for you.${prompt};
Wait, I remembered her name! The daughter of the red mage Rainemard!${prompt};
It's about time. Well, tell us, then!${prompt};
It was Curilla... Yes, Curilla was her name. I remember Rainemard watched over her well.${prompt};
Curilla? Hmm... Curilla... I've heard that name before.${prompt};
Wait, the maiden general was named Curilla! Yes, she would be about that age, too. Who would have thought that she was Rainemard's daughter!${prompt};
It must be a terrible thing...to hear your father's spirit still wanders.${prompt};
Truly!${prompt};
I would not go to that church if I were you. There you'll find no coin, only intrigue.${prompt};
What? You went to the church? How impetuous of you. And, you met the ghost? Well, there's no stopping you!${prompt};
Well, it seems you faced great danger there. But you found new trappings for battle, so all is well. Isn't it, Sharzalion?${prompt};
What's the matter? It's not like you at all.${prompt};
So, the rumor was true...${prompt};
Rumor?${prompt};
Yes, about Rainemard's death. Some say he was killed because he knew too much.${prompt};
Too much about what?${prompt};
I do not know. Surely it would behoove us to delve no further. For my part, I shall pretend I haven't heard what was spoken here today.${prompt};
You're never this timid.${prompt};
Discretion, my friend, is the better part of valor.${prompt};
Say... I know a way to talk to the dead. What do you say?${prompt};
Valdero, no!${prompt};
In Fei'Yin there is an old fountain run dry. They say that you can call a spirit of the dead by simply casting ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} into it. At any rate, that place is a decrepit ruin, so there's no end to the hogwash rumors.${prompt};
Don't believe a word of it, my friend.${prompt};
Fei'Yin is no place for you. And something is amiss about all of this. I feel like something...some invisible hand is guiding us somewhere. I want nothing more to do with it!${prompt};
What, you traveled to Fei'Yin? And you say that the ghost of Rainemard needs help? I am sorry, friend, but I want nothing to do with this anymore.${prompt};
So, that whole church uproar was Rainemard's doing... Well, I am glad his spirit found rest, and you made it out safely.${prompt};
Adventurers must know when opportunity knocks! Though there is a fine line between bravery and foolishness!${prompt};
I love a good ghost story. The best part about running a tavern is listening to all the tales that adventurers bring from afar.${prompt};
In Fei'Yin there is an old fountain run dry. They say that you can call a spirit of the dead by simply casting ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} into it. At any rate, that place is a decrepit ruin, so there's no end to the hogwash rumors.${prompt};
So, the rumor was true? Huzzah! No, I need no thanks. I am happy to just hear your tale.${prompt};
But what could he mean by a “small dark tight place”? You'd best ask the other patrons or members of your own party for their insight.${prompt};
Yes, perhaps his corpse was interred in the Garlaige Citadel. What a cruel thing to do!${prompt};
All's well that ends well, as they say. I've had a ball hearing all about it! Please, stop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.${prompt};
You are brave to speak to me! But if you're looking for leads, I have none to share.${prompt};
Well, I am after a certain chest in the Garlaige Citadel. I hear you can open it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I wonder if any treasure is hidden within.${prompt};
You found a corpse inside? I was after that chest, but now I'm glad I never opened it.${prompt};
That's one jack-in-the-box I'll never meet!${prompt};
Did you get it?;
${selection-lines};
Haha, yes.;
Uh, no.${prompt};
Heh, I thought so. We adventurers need a sense of humor!${prompt};
You have so sense of humor.${prompt};
Hmm... My own weapons are still no match for them...${prompt};
Father!${prompt};
Oh, Ailbeche. Did you run that errand for me?${prompt};
Um, yes. And, I have a favor to ask you, too.${prompt};
A favor?${prompt};
Yes, I want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. My friends said that then they'll take me fishing.${prompt};
Ailbeche, that's not something a true friend would say. You should pick your friends more carefully.${prompt};
And I have work to do. You know that, do you not?${prompt};
Yes, Father.${prompt};
Why, those ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} are from the Royal Knights. How came you by them? I should convey this to Prince Trion.${prompt};
What do you want? I'm waiting for someone. Each time the door opens, I turn to look! Begone!${prompt};
This is no concern of yours. Leave at once!${prompt};
What are you here for? You ask about my son? Please, just go!${prompt};
I know all about the intrigue of the knights! I heard that something was amiss right when my son disappeared. I know they had something to do with it!${prompt};
I am an appraiser in the employ of Madam Hinaree. Her late husband was quite a collector. These are all fine works!${prompt};
The portrait above the stairs is especially valuable. It is by Mique, court artist of King Ranperre. Pity so few of his works survive!${prompt};
The greatest mystery surrounding Mique is his brush. It is said that its bristles turn ferocious when the painter is afraid, and delicate when he is sad.${prompt};
Any artist would desire ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Some say it was hidden in Castle Zvahl, but I do not believe them.${prompt};
Do you know anyone looking for a model? I could use the money.${prompt};
Chusarlaud used to paint my portrait a lot. He was so talented. Some of his paintings are right here in this tavern.${prompt};
But now, no one's doing portraits anymore, so I can't find any work!${prompt};
Still, he always wished he had ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} whenever his spirits were down. Vemalpeau, his father, looked for it too, but it was nowhere to be found.${prompt};
What? You've never heard of Mique? Head to Madam Hinaree's mansion. A picture is worth a thousand words, they say.${prompt};
Why, you would offer this to me!? It's the paintbrush Chusarlaud always wanted. How did you know?${prompt};
In youth he wanted to be a painter. But, when his mother fell ill we lost the means, and he decided to become a knight. All on his own...${prompt};
I just couldn't ask him to quit, even though I wanted him to. He was our pride. How could such a thing happen to him?${prompt};
He has gone missing for nearly a year, but there is still a chance he lives. We've kept his room upstairs the way it's always been. Go see for yourself if you want to.${prompt};
Come to think of it, often he would read a letter from his commanding officer. Once I snatched it while he was away, but the paper was blank.${prompt};
The plume rests in the dry inkwell. ${prompt};
An unfinished letter. It says nothing special.${prompt};
A painting. It features lively brushwork.${prompt};
Further inspection reveals that all the paintings here are from the same artist.${prompt};
What now?;
${selection-lines};
Examine the painting.;
Look behind the frame.;
Nothing.${prompt};
You find an envelope with nothing written on it.${prompt};
What now?;
${selection-lines};
Open and examine.;
Leave it be.${prompt};
Father!${prompt};
What is it, Ailbeche?${prompt};
You're leaving on an expedition, right? Vilbert just left. Here's a sword. Now you can go, too.${prompt};
Expedition? What do you mean? Anyway, such a sword's no use to me.${prompt};
But, Father! Mother cleaned this sword every night! How could you have forgotten? It took me forever to remove the rust that has built up from your neglect!${prompt};
What?${prompt};
Oh, never mind!${prompt};
Ailbeche...${prompt};
What was he so excited about? Besides, my division is on standby. And where could Vilbert be heading?${prompt};
What, you want me to tell you about that paper? It's a special form my division uses for messages. The words are unseen, but they're there.${prompt};
We no longer use it, so let me tell you how it works.${prompt};
In Davoi there is a well that Orcs use. Dip the paper into its water and the writing will reappear.${prompt};
Long ago we used to keep the water in our inkwells to use when reading the messages, but now even mine is dry. Take this one to the well if you must read it.${prompt};
It says what? I would believe you, but I cannot.${prompt};
Oh, confound it! In my heart I wondered if he hadn't stumbled onto something too big for him. So, my fears were true...${prompt};
If only that fool would've let us know, and not kept his problems bottled up inside.${prompt};
At least now I know that something had happened to him. For that, I thank you.${prompt};
It broke my heart to learn about him, but now I know the truth. You'll always have my gratitude.${prompt};
Thank you for your help. I must inform Prince Trion of this unfortunate turn of events. I am summarizing my report now.${prompt};
Currently I am suggesting we sell all the weapons we purchased so far, but it's a pity we have to sell low what we bought high. Now I know how you adventurers must feel.${prompt};
My son and I are going fishing. I keep wanting to take the best pole for myself, but I am not who I once was. We will catch a big one with the same pole!${prompt};
Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt};
For one so new, I'd be... Hmm?${prompt};
Lord knight, forgive this interruption, but there is something I must ask of you.${prompt};
I question whether Queen Leaute truly passed away fifteen years past. Tell me, of what cause did she die?${prompt};
Who are you, and why do you pry with such inquiries?${prompt};
Please, I have traveled from afar to see Her Highness!${prompt};
You've what!?${prompt};
Very well. Listen closely. Fifteen years ago, Queen Leaute fell to a rare sickness. She left this world before we could save her.${prompt};
Ah, so an illness claimed her life.${prompt};
Well, it's none of your concern at any rate. Even if she lived, an adventurer like you could never see her, much less the inside of Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
Er...${prompt};
What was the name of her illness?${prompt};
We are not told such things. Only the royal family would know.${prompt};
Is that so? Well, I thank you for your kindness, proud knight of San d'Oria.${prompt};
Hey, wait!${prompt};
What was the matter with that adventurer? He was awfully stubborn, wasn't he?${prompt};
He seemed to know the late queen personally, but how could he not be aware of her death?${prompt};
At any rate, your work is done. Excellent form, my friend!${prompt};
What, you want the mission from rank one again?${prompt};
I knew you'd return safely, and with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission completed!${prompt};
Have you ever set foot into King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt};
Two hundred years ago, the curtain fell on the golden age of San d'Oria. Civil war erupted over the Kingdom's hegemony.${prompt};
King Ranperre was there to extinguish the conflict. When he died he was interred in a great tomb south of East Ronfaure.${prompt};
But unknown hands have defiled his grave of late.${prompt};
Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Ravaging a royal tomb is an unforgivable crime!${prompt};
Your orders are to investigate the tomb and determine if there is any truth to what they say. Do you understand?${prompt};
Accept the mission?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
I do not accept.${prompt};
I implore you to make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt};
But wander too deeply within, and Goblins might find you. Tread boldly, my friend, but do not go in over your head!${prompt};
Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Scour the tomb and determine if they speak the truth.${prompt};
Make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt};
Have you really searched the tomb?${prompt};
So, you got this from bats in King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt};
You see, this actually belonged to an Orc. What could Orcs want with the tomb?${prompt};
At any rate, your mission is over. Speak not a word of this to another.${prompt};
Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt};
I know you came all this way, but I can't help you right now.${prompt};
Oh, who am I fooling? Of course I could use your help!${prompt};
Have you not heard? Orcs came and kidnapped some children! We think they're keeping them at their lair in Ghelsba.${prompt};
Why, not long ago came ill news from the cathedral. A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt};
The Royal Knights would march to his rescue, but Prince Trion is away in the north, and cannot give the order.${prompt};
Prince Pieuje is in earnest deliberations over whether to send Temple Knights instead. It seems his efforts are focused upon saving the children, but...${prompt};
But no matter. We need knowledge of the enemy. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt};
A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt};
The Temple Knights may be mobilized soon. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt};
Prince Trion just informed me of your handiwork. You've done beautifully.${prompt};
Due to your exemplary contribution, ${name-player}, San d'Oria hereby recognizes you as an adventurer of rank two.${prompt};
But do not let it go to your head. This certificate is valid only in San d'Oria.${prompt};
Work hard and better things will come, my friend. Someday your name will be known to our allies as well.${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing. The vicasque of the cathedral said he wants to thank you on behalf of the boy.${prompt};
You achieve rank two.${prompt};
At any rate, you completed the mission well enough. Time for a reward!${prompt};
I award you with rank points commensurate with your achievement.${prompt};
Prince Trion ordered scouts from the Royal Knights to Davoi, while Prince Pieuje ordered scouts from the Temple Knights. It's like the right hand knows not what the left is doing!${prompt};
Monarlais Halver is furious, but first he needs knowledge. You must find the scout from the Temple Knights, receive his scouting report, and return that report to the monarlais.${prompt};
What? You were told to hand the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} to Prince Pieuje personally?${prompt};
Well, you should find His Highness in the cathedral.${prompt};
You've come just at the right time! Prince Trion wants a word with you. It seems he heard of you when you received your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Head to the chambers of Prince Trion inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt};
Prince Trion has called for you. Head to his chamber inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt};
I know not what Prince Trion wanted you to do, but see it through to the end! Understand?${prompt};
"Hello there. Now's not the time for missions; Chateau d'Oraguille has been visited by bandits!${prompt}";
You must make haste to Chateau d'Oraguille! Find Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt};
Bandits infiltrating Chateau d'Oraguille is unprecedented in history! Make haste and see Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt};
What does one use to sharpen a knife? Why, have you never heard of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
In Ordelle's Caves there lies a place with a hole above, where blows a cool breeze. There may you find ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, which makes a blade cut meat like butter!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! There isn't a soul in the Kingdom that doesn't consider you a hero!${prompt};
As a representative of the people of San d'Oria, I humbly ask you to continue your efforts for the good of the country. May the light of the Goddess shine upon you!${prompt};
Rahal has a letter for me to read, does he?;
Too busy to come himself, hmm?;
Well, let's see it...${prompt};
Ah. This is the handwriting of Ancolain B Feulart, former second in command of the Royal Knights.${prompt};
I was the one who relieved him of his command...${prompt};
Why are you doing this to me...?;
Surely you must know of the many victories I have achieved for the glory of San d'Oria!${prompt};
Yes, I am aware of them.${prompt};
Then why?${prompt};
There is a quality that your blade lacks.;
And that quality is sorrow. Rahal understands the sorrow in taking up his sword.${prompt};
Sorrow?;
We are not composers of verse!;
What use is sorrow to a warrior?${prompt};
And therein lies your arrogance.;
There have been many instances of you ignoring the orders of your general and leading the knights on a path of your own choosing.${prompt};
And haven't I always brought us to victory in doing so?${prompt};
At the cost of the lives of many of our men.;
It is an oversight too dangerous for a commander of our forces to make.${prompt};
What...!;
Ah, I understand.;
You're saying that San d'Oria has no further use for me.${prompt};
You miss my point.;
Once you have given consideration to my words, we can think about reinstating you to your position.${prompt};
No, I believe I will take my leave of the knights.;
I will find a place where I am appreciated for who I am.;
May you not regret your words here today, Sir Balasiel.${prompt};
So Ancolain has issued a challenge to the Royal Knights, has he?;
It seems my words had no effect upon him...;
A pity.${prompt};
You have a wyvern that responds to your call?;
Your wyvern will be able to sense Ancolain's location from the shadow of the thoughts that still cling to the letter.;
That's all the help that I can give you.${prompt};
I'm glad they've run out of mulsum--it would completely ruin my diet!${prompt};
May I speak with you for a moment?;
Oh...it seems you have other matters to attend to. Perhaps another time.${prompt};
Next time I'm looking for an adventurer, you'll be first on my list.${prompt};
May I speak with you for a moment about the ecology of Vana'diel?${prompt};
Are you interested?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
Sounds fascinating, but...${prompt};
Have you heard of Ordelle's Caves?${prompt};
Yes, those beautiful natural formations that wind their way under the La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
Are you aware that right now, a limestone-eating fiend is destroying the splendor of the caves with its voracious appetite?${prompt};
We need the assistance of upstanding, environmentally conscious adventurers such as yourself in ridding the caves of this monster. Can we count on your cooperation?${prompt};
Take on the task?;
${selection-lines};
You can count on me!;
I have to clean my Mog House...${prompt};
I knew you'd come through for us!;
Bring me proof that you've defeated the creature, and I'll pay you a reward from the Vana'diel Environmental Resource Management Initiative Network fund.${prompt};
Rojaireaut, our V.E.R.M.I.N. agent in the field, will be waiting for you in the caves. Come back safe, now!${prompt};
I see... Well, I suppose I must ask another citizen for help.${prompt};
Rojaireaut, our V.E.R.M.I.N. agent in the field, will be waiting with further instructions in the caves.${prompt};
You've brought me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from the vanquished fiend?;
Wonderful! I knew you could do it! Here's your reward, as promised.${prompt};
DEBUG:このクエストを受けました。${prompt};
DEBUG:このクエストを断りました。${prompt};
Rochefogne!;
Where have you gone, Rochefogne? San d'Oria needs you!${prompt};
You there! Have you seen Rochefogne?${prompt};
I apologize, Your Highness. I have not seen the man you seek.${prompt};
Where could he have gone...?;
His wounds are still fresh. He requires more rest.${prompt};
Leaute, my sister. If you could only be here today... How proud you would be of your children. May you rest in peace knowing that.${prompt};
Now I must be on my way. I have no right to remain here in your kingdom.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. I may be leaving San d'Oria, but this is not the end of my travels. No, it is just the beginning. The same is true for you, is it not?${prompt};
I have a feeling our paths may cross again one day. May we pray that when that day comes, San d'Oria will have regained the luster that it once had.${prompt};
One day far in the future, historians will look back on this moment as the end of a chapter in San d'Orian history.${prompt};
...A chapter filled with blood, deceit, and chaos.${prompt};
However, those historians will never know that the tale they describe would never have transpired, were it not for the deeds of one brave adventurer. It is often said that the greatest heroes are the ones who remain unknown.${prompt};
But who knows what the future holds for ${name-player}?${prompt};
Perhaps the pages of the next chapter will be graced with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name.${prompt};
But that is another story...${prompt};
What can be said is this:${prompt};
Even if one day Vana'diel were to vanish from the universe as we know it...${prompt};
The trials you endured in San d'Oria--the pain, the anger, the tears, and the laughter...${prompt};
Those memories will forever remain in your heart and never fade...${prompt};
Until the end...${prompt};
The end of time...${prompt};
Ah, you look as if you have spent many a day with a polearm by your side. Long I have been waiting for an adventurer of your caliber.${prompt};
Prince Trion has entrusted me with an important task. Let me explain...${prompt};
While there is not an army in all of Vana'diel that can match the swordsmanship of the San d'Orian knights, our ranks still lack training in polearm techniques. This lack in skill restricts our versatility in battle.${prompt};
Back in the age when the Dragon King ruled the land, even the captain of the Royal Knights, Erpalacion, was a master with the spear. However, with the decline in the number of dragoons, the techniques that those great men used have all but been lost.${prompt};
To deal with this looming problem, the prince has asked me to construct a set of guidelines in mastering the art of the polearm.${prompt};
That is where you come in. I would like you to assist me in testing the new guidelines I have come up with.${prompt};
Can you lend your assistance?;
${selection-lines};
I would be honored!;
I have affairs of greater importance.${prompt};
Spoken like a true purveyor of strength.;
We shall begin by conducting basic training.${prompt};
Take this polearm and fight to your heart's content. The weapon will transmit its power into your body. When it has been drained of all its energy, you will know that your skills have been refined and your training is near complete.${prompt};
When you feel that time has come, return to me with the spear, and I will evaluate your progress.${prompt};
I see...;
It is not every day that I meet an adventurer with your skill. I was sure that both of us could have benefited from my offer...;
If you ever have a change of heart, I will be waiting here for your return.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. How goes your training?;
Show me the polearm I entrusted to you and I can evaluate your progress. Or have you called upon me for another reason...?${prompt};
What is the purpose of your visit?;
${selection-lines};
I have lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...;
I request to withdraw from the training.;
I was just passing by.${prompt};
Lost it? You have lost it!?;
Why, do you realize the trouble I was forced to go through with those crooks at the Brugaire Consortium to obtain that polearm?${prompt};
<Sigh>;
...I apologize for my outburst. It was I who requested your services in this matter. Please, take this spear and continue your training. However, you will have to start from the beginning.;
And please try not to lose this one...${prompt};
Was what I asked too much for even you? No, it could not be... My years of experience led me to the construction of those training guidelines.${prompt};
You are not truly considering giving up?;
${selection-lines};
I have had enough.;
On second thought...${prompt};
I knew that you were the one for this task. Anyone who cannot handle simple training such as this does not have the right to hold a polearm in their hands.${prompt};
If you grow weary of your training, then feel free to rest. While glory does not befall those who run from the hardships they face, it must also be remembered that a true master is not born in a single day's time. ${prompt};
What is this? Have you no faith in my guidelines?${prompt};
I cannot believe what I am hearing...;
Leave me be! I will search for a more suited adventurer to take on this task.${prompt};
I am sorry, but I do not believe that you have used this weapon to its full extent. Continue your training. You will know when you have reached your goal.${prompt};
Excellent!;
The wear of this weapon is a direct reflection of your progress.${prompt};
Now all that remains is the final portion of your training, where you must use your newly acquired techniques in a battle to the death. This will not be easy, but I am sure that your experience will guide you to victory.${prompt};
Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and travel to the Sea Serpent Grotto. There you will find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} buried in the earth. You are to bring that back here to me.${prompt};
Do not think of this as a simple errand. This is your final test, and it will require all the knowledge and experience you have acquired through the course of this training.${prompt};
Now go prepare yourself for this battle in the way you see fit. You will no longer need the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Good luck.${prompt};
You look much stronger than when I last saw you. You must have successfully completed the training course I laid out in my guidelines!${prompt};
This proves that my methods can be of great importance to the Kingdom! I look forward to the day when our knights reach the level that you have already acquired.${prompt};
Balasiel, how goes the preparation of our new guidelines?${prompt};
My Lord!;
With the assistance of this noble ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/lady], I have been able to complete my writing. It will not be long before those wretched Orcs tremble at the sight of our newly trained knights.${prompt};
That is good news indeed.;
${name-player}, I thank you for your work in helping San d'Oria. I think that I might head over to the training grounds myself for a firsthand try at these new techniques.${prompt};
Prince Trion, you cannot be serious...!${prompt};
Hah hah hah! Balasiel, of course it was a joke!${prompt};
I apologize, my Lord. However, it did not sound much like a joke...${prompt};
Balasiel. Once you have completed your report, deliver it to Monarlais Halver. He will continue the preparations from there.${prompt};
Yes, my Lord!${prompt};
I cannot thank you enough for all you have done. Were it not for you, I could not have completed my work.;
Soon, all the knights of San d'Oria will be polishing their polearm skills with the new “${name-player} Method.”${prompt};
I regret that I cannot reimburse you for the time you have spent assisting me. However, you will soon realize that your training has unlocked a powerful force inside you. This new skill is your true reward.${prompt};
I thank you again for your assistance. And remember, this newly acquired skill is not the end of your training, but the beginning.${prompt};
You have learned the weapon skill “Impulse Drive”!${prompt};
Good day, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame].;
My name is Phillone. I recently moved here from Bastok with my husband and younger brother.${prompt};
And where are they now, you ask? They...they are quite busy with their work! So much so that I rarely see them at home these days.;
Please stop by for another visit sometime!${prompt};
I must remain calm...stay focused. I've finally been given a chance to rise above this sorry gate-guard existence. If only I could show them what I'm worth...${prompt};
Wha-!${prompt};
My duty is to guard this city gate! I was certainly not considering running off to catch that thief for tawdry fame and glory!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh, it's just an adventurer. You startled me.${prompt};
A burglar broke into the royal treasury the other day and pilfered the precious Scepter Royaulais.${prompt};
Mayhap it was you!?${prompt};
No, your face does not match that of the sketch I saw.${prompt};
I apologize for my hasty accusation.;
The Temple Knights have scoured the entire Kingdom, but have yet to discover a single clue regarding the thief's whereabouts.${prompt};
Have you not heard of the Scepter Royaulais? It is the scepter borne by the king, a symbol of office bestowed by the papsque at the coronation ceremony.${prompt};
I, too, wish to make a name for myself in this world someday.${prompt};
We've finally found a lead!${prompt};
A traveling merchant has reported a suspicious character lurking in La Theine Plateau! It may just be the burglar we're looking for.${prompt};
You speak truly!?${prompt};
I am Elmemague of the Temple Knights.;
I must travel to the rescue drill site in La Theine Plateau and join my fellows.${prompt};
However, if our quarry is the burglar who managed to infiltrate the chateau single-handedly, I worry that our numbers may be too few.;
I ask that you contact the Royal Knights to send reinforcements!${prompt};
The Royal Knights are posted beyond the borders of the Kingdom! Recruiting the assistance of even the closest knights will take time.${prompt};
Dash it all! The scoundrel will not tarry long...${prompt};
Why, the solution stands right before you! I understand that it may be dangerous, but someone must accompany...${prompt};
Of course!;
Adventurer! Will you not lend a hand? If the thief is caught, you will be rewarded most handsomely!${prompt};
Wait, what I meant was I could go with...${prompt};
Come, adventurer! The royal treasure must be wrested from the hands of that villain!${prompt};
Will you help?;
${selection-lines};
Lead the way!;
I cannot help at this time...${prompt};
I see...;
If you happen to change your mind, talk to the guard here. Your help would be greatly appreciated.${prompt};
You will help? Splendid! Then let us be off to La Theine Plateau and join forces with the rest of my men!${prompt};
I, uh, I will accompany you on this important...${prompt};
You must remain here. When the knights return from their patrols, tell them to make haste to La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
...Yes, sir.${prompt};
No dithering now, adventurer! We leave immediately!${prompt};
It is of no matter. I'm not the slightest bit disappointed.;
“Lowly gate-guard” seems to be my lot in this life...${prompt};
Well, that is a shame. We could have used your help.${prompt};
I will return anon!${prompt};
It is of no matter, no matter at all.;
“Lowly gate-guard” seems to be my lot in this life...${prompt};
Sir Elmemague has asked for the assistance of adventurers in the capture of the suspected thief lurking in La Theine Plateau...${prompt};
Then you must make haste for La Theine Plateau. The knights there will give you further instructions.${prompt};
I see.;
If it were me, I'd offer up my sword in a heartbeat...${prompt};
You've forgotten already?;
Make for La Theine Plateau, and the knights there will give you further instructions.${prompt};
I'm not feeling the smallest shred of envy. I have absolutely no interest in proving myself through acts of honor and courage...${prompt};
Oh, it's you. How did you fare?${prompt};
So they caught him, did they? How wonderful it must be to stand at the forefront of action...${prompt};
Is it true!?${prompt};
And you are, madame?${prompt};
My name is Phillone.;
What has become of the one who stole the Scepter Royaulais? Did they catch him? Is he unharmed?${prompt};
A highly suspicious character was apprehended in La Theine, but whether or not he is the criminal remains to be seen...${prompt};
He's not a bad pers...he is no criminal. Please, you must help him!${prompt};
The suspect?${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you not? I beg you, you have to do something!${prompt};
It is out of our hands...${prompt};
...${prompt};
My pardon for my wife's behavior. I am her husband, Roido.${prompt};
Come now, Phillone, let's go home. It'll be all right. You'll see.${prompt};
But...${prompt};
I said, let's go...!${prompt};
What was she on about, I wonder...${prompt};
Ah yes, I almost forgot. If the man they caught is really the burglar, you will be eligible for a reward from Monarlais Halver. Why don't you head over to the chateau and check on the proceedings?${prompt};
If the man they caught is really the burglar, you will be eligible for a reward from Monarlais Halver. Why don't you head over to the chateau and check on the proceedings?${prompt};
I apologize for my outburst earlier. I've been a little under the weather...;
Please, forget I said anything.${prompt};
Hmm, so the man they caught wasn't the one who stole the Scepter Royaulais?${prompt};
Which means I still have a chance! I'm going to catch that thief and show everyone what I'm made of.;
I'll be a famous knight yet!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh, you were at the chateau.${prompt};
Hold it right there! You're the scoundrel who made off with the scepter--admit it!${prompt};
Young man, do you know of the esteemed personages of King Raigegue and Prince Fellenant?${prompt};
Huh? Well, yes.;
They were of the royal family of San d'Oria two hundred years ago. It was their struggle for control of the Kingdom that caused the civil war before the time of King Ranperre.${prompt};
You are certain!?;
Then the internal strife began...${prompt};
Hmm, that would have been several years after our crushing defeat at the Second Battle of Konschtat.${prompt};
Prince Fellenant recruited the Temple Knights to his cause and took control of the city. He then declared his intention to forge a peace with Bastok.${prompt};
"However, his older brother, King Raigegue, could not forgive his younger sibling's actions; this call for peace had come right at the height of the king's efforts to rally the remaining Royal Knights for a counterattack against the Republic.${prompt}";
What of Vijartal Caphieux!?${prompt};
Do you truly not know?;
He is one of the foremost heroes in our kingdom's history. It was during the time of civil war that Vijartal Caphieux rose to prominence through his valorous actions. Why, I shouldn't think the smallest child in San d'Oria would be unaware of his deeds.${prompt};
You jest with me...surely? Is this, then, the world of the future? What a ridiculous notion...${prompt};
What an odd character. Well, never mind. What I should be focusing on now is the capture of that rogue and the retrieval of the Scepter Royaulais.${prompt};
That's it!;
Do you remember the lady that introduced herself as Phillone? I think her story bears further investigation, but I cannot leave my post.${prompt};
Could you go and find out more about her as a favor to me? I must solve this crime if I'm ever to be noticed by my superiors. Please let me know if you discover anything important.${prompt};
Could you go and find out more about the lady who calls herself Phillone? I must solve this crime if I'm ever to be noticed by my superiors. Please let me know if you discover anything important.${prompt};
You...you're the adventurer I talked to before! What happened to the man they caught? Was he unharmed!?${prompt};
What? He wasn't the thief they were looking for?${prompt};
Naphee, it's you!${prompt};
What a relief...;
I'm so glad you're here! This isn't some future world after all!${prompt};
My pardon, sir, but I don't believe we've met...${prompt};
I've had the most trying day. Tedious nonsense from the people at the chateau, all this talk about me being some sort of hero...${prompt};
My bones are in need of a rest, dear Naphee. I think I'll take a short nap, if you don't mind.${prompt};
Just a moment! Who are you, sir? You don't just go barging into people's homes as you please!${prompt};
What are you babbling about, Naphee?${prompt};
Naphee? My name is Phillone!${prompt};
I'm not in the mood for these games, especially not in my own house. I expect more from my one and only love.${prompt};
Your love!?;
What in Altana's name are you on about!? Leave at once or I shall call upon the Temple Knights!${prompt};
Phillone?;
What's wrong? You're all flushed.${prompt};
A Hume...and that accent...;
You can't possibly be a Bastoker!?${prompt};
Well, yes, I am.${prompt};
You've got some nerve setting foot in the holy city of San d'Oria! Or perhaps you've escaped from your prison cell!?${prompt};
This is my home. Have I done something wrong that I'm not aware of?${prompt};
I don't understand...;
My mind must be playing tricks on me...${prompt};
This is my home, is it not? And yet I find some filthy Bastoker living here with a woman who should be my darling Naphee.${prompt};
Where on Vana'diel is this place? Have I truly been catapulted into the future?${prompt};
Who was that man?;
And why do I feel like I've met him somewhere before...?${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you? And you're looking for the thief of the Scepter Royaulais?${prompt};
I have a favor to ask.${prompt};
I need your help in retrieving the stolen scepter.${prompt};
You see, the person who stole the Scepter Royaulais was actually my younger brother, Millechairale.${prompt};
Forgive my rash words before, adventurer. I'd believed it was Millechairale who had been captured.${prompt};
There is a legend that tells of a mysterious power being attributed to the Pierre Errante, the gem that graces the tip of the Scepter Royaulais. This is why it has been handed down through generations of San d'Orian kings and become a symbol of our country in its own right.${prompt};
And that is what Millechairale has gone and stolen...${prompt};
But my brother is no common thief! He has no evil purpose in his heart. I beg you, please help Millechairale...${prompt};
Fearing for his own safety, Millechairale hid the Scepter Royaulais somewhere. It is my plan to find that hiding place and return the scepter to the chateau before he has a chance to reclaim it.${prompt};
By doing this, perhaps the knights won't be so hard on Millechairale if they do happen to catch him. Maybe they'll even give up on their investigation when the royal treasure is restored to its rightful place.${prompt};
But the request of our ancestor...${prompt};
Phillone. I understand how you feel, but the safety of your brother is more important.${prompt};
I...I know you're right, but...${prompt};
The only problem is, the place I need to get to is teeming with monsters. I don't think I can make it without the help of a seasoned knight...${prompt};
Would you happen to know any trustworthy knights who might aid me in this endeavor?${prompt};
Adventurer, please help my family...${prompt};
Time is running short.${prompt};
Please, ${name-player}. Find a knight of caliber to save my family from this looming disaster!${prompt};
So, did you discover anything important?${prompt};
Adventurer, I need to find a seasoned knight. I'm sorry, but this man is not exactly...${prompt};
What's all this about?${prompt};
Oh, if it isn't the very same gentlemen I was speaking with earlier.${prompt};
You seem perplexed. Hm? You're looking for a competent knight? Well, look no further, I know the perfect man to deal with any situation.${prompt};
You do!? Where can we find this person?${prompt};
I am Vijartal Caphieux, knight extraordinaire of the illustrious Caphieux family! Ancient hero of San d'Oria in the world of the future!${prompt};
I think his sword belt is on a little tight...${prompt};
A knight, be he of the past or future, must not be unsettled by trivial matters. In this world, I am a renowned hero. What say you, are you not impressed?${prompt};
I must think of a more fitting name for myself.;
What do you think of “Thunderbringer Vijartal”? Has a little more punch to it.${prompt};
Hmmm, there must be something better, though...;
I have it! How about “Vijartal Caphieux, the Obsidian Bolt”? Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?${prompt};
Vijartal Caphieux?${prompt};
The Obsidian Bolt...;
Yes, I like it! Give me some time to work on a new signature.${prompt};
Excuse me, might I have a word with you? We can speak at my house.${prompt};
I see. Your tale is a sorry one. But why should I be the one to help your brother?${prompt};
Well, since you introduced yourself as Vijartal Caphieux, the famed knight, I figured you must be a skilled warrior. Your assistance would be most welcome.${prompt};
As I am most certain it would be. However, no matter how great my ability may be, there are many preparations I must make. My sword is in need of repair, and there are several other things...${prompt};
Seeing as your name is the same as our ancient hero, the Temple Knights might let you off lightly, even if you are caught helping us.${prompt};
Naphee, always with that tone of voice...${prompt};
My name is Phillone.${prompt};
You and she are so very similar.${prompt};
Very well, then. I will help you. All we need to do is retrieve the Scepter Royaulais, correct? A knight is bound to aid those weaker than himself. That is what I always... Ah, never mind.${prompt};
You'll help us!? Thank you, we will never forget this for the rest of our...${prompt};
However, I do not trust Bastokers.${prompt};
What?${prompt};
The people of Bastok are vulgar and uncouth, and should be despised by any upstanding citizen of noble San d'Oria. I will not suffer to be lumped in with the likes of him.${prompt};
I beg your pardon!;
There is no such enmity between the people of San d'Oria and Bastok! Apologize to Roido at once!${prompt};
Again, your resemblance to my Naphee is uncanny.${prompt};
You don't need to pretend to like me, but I cannot go to that place alone. It's far too dangerous.${prompt};
Dangerous!? Are there fiends and the like in this place?${prompt};
Without a doubt. Knowing Millechairale, he has hidden the scepter somewhere in the vast forest that lies beyond King Ranperre's Tomb.${prompt};
Then I suppose I must accompany you. But listen well, Bastoker! You do not speak to me, understood?${prompt};
Ah... Do you think you could come along? I'm not sure if I can really trust that man...${prompt};
My brother has hidden the scepter somewhere in the vast forest that lies beyond King Ranperre's Tomb. Please find it before he returns there!${prompt};
That lady had nothing to do with the theft? Hmm, it seems my instincts were well off the mark. Perhaps my only road to greatness lies through the diligent performance of my guard duties...${prompt};
So, Millechairale has the Scepter Royaulais...${prompt};
That one was always far too dedicated!;
Whatever am I to do?${prompt};
...${prompt};
I stole into the royal book vault and read the documents that pertained to me. What Roido said was true.${prompt};
It would seem that after the incident...I am to die.${prompt};
What...?${prompt};
My family, the Caphieux family, has a bloodline that stretches back to the founding of the Kingdom. That is why I was chosen as the envoy to meet with Prince Fellenant. I was entrusted with the Scepter Royaulais and the message of the king's abdication...${prompt};
This was nothing more than a charade. My true mission was to bide my time and wait for an opportunity to assassinate the prince.${prompt};
Right at this moment...or what would be this moment in the past, the Cardinal Stags should be making their way towards the capital, bearing the Scepter Royaulais. One of them will surely carry out the assassination in my place.${prompt};
Tell me, adventurer! What in Altana's name happened in the world of my time? Why must I disobey my king's orders and put my very life in jeopardy to protect Prince Fellenant?${prompt};
Phillone!;
The Temple Knights have picked up Millechairale's trail!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
They haven't caught him yet, but you can bet that he's headed for Ordelle's Caves to carry out his oath.${prompt};
Why would he...? He's walking right into their hands!${prompt};
Please, lend me your aid once more! Millechairale's life depends on it!${prompt};
No, I don't think I will.${prompt};
What?${prompt};
Why should I listen to the pleas of a Bastoker?${prompt};
Just one moment, sir! Are you insulting my husband again...?${prompt};
Vijartal, why do you despise Bastokers so much?${prompt};
My father was killed by Bastokers and their underhanded tactics in the Second Battle of Konschtat! And my older brother returned from his attempt to avenge his death a mutilated corpse!${prompt};
Bastok is the hated enemy of San d'Oria! That Republic is responsible for the deaths of everyone I held dear!${prompt};
You say that hero wished for peace among our nations!? Preposterous!;
I...Vijartal Caphieux would rather die than aid Bastok...${prompt};
Do you think it was any different for the people of Bastok!?${prompt};
I don't...?${prompt};
Up until a mere few decades past, the nations of San d'Oria and Bastok had fought countless battles over land, resources, and religion.${prompt};
Both San d'Orians and Bastokers lost friends and family. Many have lost people dear to them...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Do you not find it strange? We are all the children of Altana, and yet there is hostility and conflict among us...${prompt};
What we should really despise is war itself, not the people who are drawn into its flames. I thank Altana from the depths of my soul that we live in an age where war between the people of Vana'diel is a thing of the past.${prompt};
We must go now if we are to save Millechairale. I don't know how much time we have.${prompt};
I am going with you!${prompt};
Phillone, I need you to stay here. If the Temple Knights decide to send reinforcements, try and stall them any way you can.${prompt};
I'll do my best.${prompt};
I'm going on ahead. Meet me at the entrance to Ordelle's Caves as soon as you can. If those soldiers catch up to him...${prompt};
Please, get my brother out of there safely!${prompt};
You are an unusual woman.${prompt};
I'm sorry?${prompt};
My lady's name, the one you so resemble, is Naphee.;
She once asked me a question:${prompt};
Why must the people of San d'Oria and Bastok despise each other even though we are all the children of Altana?${prompt};
The year before last, we left Bastok to settle here in the capital. The two nations are not so different, you know. All people have the same hopes, the same dreams...${prompt};
There were those who saw the Elvaan as a hated enemy, but there were also kind and caring souls such as Roido, who treated me like a person...${prompt};
It will take time, but I believe that if we continue to chip away at the barriers of prejudice and ignorance that stand between us, we will eventually come to understand each other.${prompt};
You too, Vijartal, can find peace...just as Roido and I have.${prompt};
Why this fate... If only our ancestor had not left his request for the Scepter Royaulais to be brought to Ordelle's Caves...! Altana, keep my family from harm!${prompt};
This can't be happening! Millechairale has been captured!?${prompt};
I am sorry. I have failed you...${prompt};
Monarlais Halver?${prompt};
Roido! Phillone!${prompt};
Millechairale! Why have they brought you here!?${prompt};
It is a miracle! That man who called himself Vijartal was the actual hero of legend!${prompt};
A sealed letter with orders to be opened this year has been passed down through the royal family. It is a document written by Prince Fellenant, the man saved by Vijartal Caphieux.${prompt};
That document is about your family.${prompt};
Unbelievable!${prompt};
According to this letter, Millechairale Caphieux would steal the Scepter Royaulais. However, he and those who accompanied him are not to be charged with any crime, as requested by Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt};
It was written that these people would sustain the good relations between our kingdom and Bastok, as well as play a vital role in the future of San d'Oria.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
It is a most unusual document. But the will of Prince Fellenant, a direct ancestor of the current d'Oraguille royal family, is incontestable.${prompt};
While we are on the subject, are you aware of the legend that surrounds the Pierre Errante?${prompt};
Vijartal Caphieux convinced Fellenant to reopen the city after preventing the prince's assassination. It is said that in that moment, Prince Fellenant gazed into the Pierre Errante and saw a glimpse of the future.${prompt};
It is not exactly certain what vision the prince beheld. Only that nations that were once at war would join hands in the spirit of cooperation. After seeing this dream of the future, Prince Fellenant surrendered to his brother, the king.${prompt};
This surrender was under the condition that the Temple Knights, who had acted under the prince's orders to take control of the capital, be held free of responsibility. Also, a treaty calling for the cessation of hostilities with Bastok was to be ratified.${prompt};
And what became of Vijartal Caphieux? Well, that is a tale known by any child of the Kingdom. He was fatally poisoned while grappling with the assassin intent on taking the prince's life...${prompt};
The strangest thing is that the true grave of Vijartal has never been found. With the deeds he performed, I am sure he was interred in a suitably resplendent tomb, however.${prompt};
In any case, after his surrender, Prince Fellenant was imprisoned in the oubliette. It was an official stance that the blood of the royal family was not to be spilled, no matter the crime.${prompt};
Three years after his imprisonment, the prince managed to escape. As we all know, this sparked the beginning of the grueling civil war that scarred one hundred years of San d'Orian history.${prompt};
This internal conflict persisted until the Dragon King, Ranperre, took the throne and united the Elvaan people once again. In his veins flowed the same blood as Prince Fellenant.${prompt};
I must apologize. It was not my intention to give such a protracted history lesson.${prompt};
Rather, I was quite surprised to hear that the line of Vijartal Caphieux still flourished in the capital.${prompt};
Until recently, we had been residing in the city of Bastok.${prompt};
In Bastok?${prompt};
Yes, our family has been there for several generations...${prompt};
Hmm... Come to think of it, there is literature that tells of a knight who organized Prince Fellenant's escape, and who later took refuge in Bastok.${prompt};
Apparently, this knight signed his name as the “Obsidian Bolt.”${prompt};
Would you know anything about this?${prompt};
Actually, perhaps it would be best not to breach that subject. If I started on the convoluted history of our kingdom, the moon could pass though its cycle and I would still have only scratched the surface.${prompt};
What's that you say? You have met with the hero of this tale? Hahaha, now you are poking fun at me!${prompt};
It is time I returned to my duties.;
Phillone. They will be released in due time, but for a while Roido and Millechairale's presence will be required at the chateau.${prompt};
There are too many details of this case that remain unclear to me. I should like to listen to a full explanation of these goings-on, as well as hear more about your ancestors...${prompt};
Do not worry for us, dear sister. I am sure we will be back before you know it.${prompt};
Yes, and then we can continue our peaceful life here, in this house of Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt};
I await your return.${prompt};
Was that man really our...;
No, it isn't possible.;
Now, I must get used to this quiet house without those two around to liven things up!${prompt};
Intruders!${prompt};
...Is something I've always wanted to say, but having “nothing to report” day in, day out is probably for the best, all things considered. Still, it must have been exciting to live in the same age as Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt};
You say you met with Louverance? How was the young fellow?${prompt};
I see... He rarely visits any more.;
I have been so worried. If anything were to happen to him, my late husband would be devastated.${prompt};
Hm?;
The Multinational Expedition? Why, I have not heard that name for thirty years...${prompt};
Yes, I remember it like it was yesterday...;
Back then, my husband and I lived in a manor just outside of the village of La Vaule, though I think the area is called Davoi now.${prompt};
There was a monastery in the center of the village. When Muchavatte, the papsque at the time, visited the monastery, he would often stop by our residence.${prompt};
I recall His Holiness mentioning that the expedition was called to ascertain certain information brought forth by the Bastokan government.${prompt};
At that time, the Humes claimed that there was a powerful force of some sort hidden deep within the forbidden Northlands.${prompt};
Of course, the papsque could not fully believe the stories of those conniving Bastokers.${prompt};
However, it was my husband who suggested that this powerful force could be the Gates of Paradise...${prompt};
Lady Hinaree! So you mean to say the cathedral had located the gates?${prompt};
Why, it is...!${prompt};
Oh, how our little guest from Tavnazia has grown! And just look at how beautiful you've become!${prompt};
I can assume that this adventurer is your acquaintance?${prompt};
I apologize for my intrusion, Lady Hinaree. When I heard you speak of the Gates of Paradise, I could not control myself...${prompt};
It is all right, my child. I am just so overwhelmed. I never imagined that we would meet again. What has it been, twenty years?${prompt};
Yes. And I must once again express my greatest thanks for the kindness you showed me then.${prompt};
Oh, such a display of humility is not necessary. According to Mildaurion C Giloumet, you were a very special guest.${prompt};
I can still hear her words, “Please welcome into your home the world-renowned minstrel, Lady Ulmia.”${prompt};
<Laugh>;
You were still so young, I wondered how and when you had become “world-renowned.” It was then you told me that you were traveling with the cardinal as you wished to see Vana'diel.${prompt};
Again, I apologize...${prompt};
Yes, I remember now...;
Was there not another young lady with you?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh, I am so sorry. I was not thinking. I did not realize that she...${prompt};
No, that is all right. She is still alive. She managed to escape the flames of the war with me.${prompt};
Oh, it is so relieving to hear that another child of Vana'diel has been blessed by the light of the Dawn Goddess.${prompt};
Yes, things were much better thirty years ago, when both Muchavatte and Mildaurion were still with us...${prompt};
They would sit in the study with my husband and chatter till the wee hours of the morning, discussing the existence of the Gates of Paradise.${prompt};
Lady Hinaree, would it be too much to ask what you know of the gates?${prompt};
The reason I have traveled here from Tavnazia is to inquire with the cathedral on the subject.${prompt};
...${prompt};
The explanation given to the masses was more vague and misleading than any of my canticles.${prompt};
I have heard tales that the explanation was a message from Altana, given to the papsque on his deathbed. However, I have also heard much to contradict this.${prompt};
Please. Tell me if there is more to the story.${prompt};
Ulmia, Paradise is a beautiful place--a magnificent place with neither death nor fear.${prompt};
When my village was attacked by the Orcs, the bloody hands of destiny ripped my husband away from me. The faith in Paradise that the papsque instilled in me--that is what saved my life.${prompt};
You sing the words of the heart, Ulmia. You should know that truth is not what always saves us.${prompt};
But if it is the only thing that offers salvation, then there is nothing more important.${prompt};
Cardinal Mildaurion told me that the courage to face the truth is what will ultimately save us.${prompt};
The cardinal said that...?${prompt};
Very well...;
There is one thing that His Holiness mentioned when I visited him after he had fallen ill.${prompt};
“I was forced to abandon the truth.”${prompt};
Abandon...the truth?${prompt};
The look on his face when he told me this was that of a man who was standing at the gates of the afterlife. I did not have the courage to ask him what he meant by his words.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I cannot know if the “truth” which the papsque spoke of had any relation to the Gates of Paradise.${prompt};
However, it was not long after this meeting that Cardinal Mildaurion revoked her own nobility and disappeared from the Kingdom. Now that I think of it, this event may have some relation with Muchavatte's words.${prompt};
The cardinal revoked her nobility? When did this occur?${prompt};
Nearly twenty years ago, of course. I believe it was just a few days after the Orcs' surprise attack on the Marquisate. Did you not know?${prompt};
No, I did not. I thought Cardinal Mildaurion was a victim of the assault. The last time I saw her, she was standing in Tavnazia as it crumbled and burned.${prompt};
It seems as if the light of Altana has blessed the cardinal as well.${prompt};
Yes... It does...;
Lady Hinaree, do you happen to know where she headed after revoking her nobility?${prompt};
That I do not know. However, I did hear that the cathedral has sent a knight to investigate her whereabouts.${prompt};
That knight's name is Louverance--one of the direct descendants of the former Knights Mistalle. I say “former” because the family was stripped of its royalty years ago. It is said that Louverance himself was once a member of the Royal Knights.${prompt};
Abandon the truth...${prompt};
Is that truth connected in some way with the Gates of Paradise, or could it be something else? Truth of the expedition, perhaps?${prompt};
And Cardinal Mildaurion... I never knew she was still alive.;
But if it is true, why has she not returned to Tavnazia?${prompt};
Has she forgotten about us...about me?${prompt};
I recall His Holiness mentioning that the expedition was called to ascertain certain information brought forth by the Bastokan government.${prompt};
However, you might try enquiring in Windurst.;
This matter is still clouded in uncertainties...${prompt};
But putting unsettling thoughts aside, today's reunion was a most pleasant surprise. We must give thanks to gentle Altana for this wondrous blessing.${prompt};
Hm? You are looking for Louverance N Mistalle?${prompt};
That may be more difficult than you imagine. However, if you are blessed with the light of Altana, nothing is impossible.${prompt};
Ah, you are the adventurer that stopped by before.;
Did you happen to find Prishe?${prompt};
I see...;
I heard from Ulmia about what has transpired.${prompt};
It is distressing to hear that Prishe, as ill as she is, is involved in all this. And now Ulmia says that she is missing and that the Jeunoan government has issued a warrant for her capture.${prompt};
${name-player}, you are acquainted with Prishe, are you not?${prompt};
Though I met her only once long ago, I cannot believe that she could do the things the Duchy is accusing her of.${prompt};
It may simply be a needless worry, but there is one thing that troubles me.${prompt};
When Cardinal Mildaurion brought her disciple, Prishe, to our residence, my husband told me to watch out for her...${prompt};
When I asked why, he said that her birth was a great misfortune, and that in due time she would commit a great crime against Vana'diel and her children--this was her destiny.${prompt};
And that was all he would say...${prompt};
Oh, do not worry, ${name-player}. I have abandoned all self-interests and pledged my services to the Dawn Goddess.${prompt};
I do not care whether or not one has committed crimes in the past. I cannot turn my back on one who pleads for help.${prompt};
I have offered my assistance to Ulmia in her time of need. I have also suggested that she stay here.${prompt};
Please, would you be so kind as to relay an important message to her?${prompt};
Moments ago, a high priest from the cathedral, Chasalvige, stopped by. He asked to speak with Ulmia.${prompt};
I believe she is somewhere near the port. I would be extremely grateful if you would find her and tell her to visit the cathedral.${prompt};
Ulmia journeys to the port every day to ask travelers if they know anything of Prishe.${prompt};
Would you be so kind as to find her and tell her to visit High Priest Chasalvige in the cathedral?${prompt};

I have come across the most frightening information concerning the dark schemes of the beastmen.;
It appears they have succeeded in awakening their divinity.${prompt};
The “Kindred” that inhabit the Northlands are said to have been created by this deity. Could the Twilight God have returned...?${prompt};
I must leave for the north immediately, and determine the truth of these rumors firsthand.;
Lord Excenmille's army has begun operations to completely obliterate the fiendish forces that lie beyond the Northlands.${prompt};
If I can but reach their camp, I should be able to further research this god of the beastmen.;
Fortunately, I was able to send word to the count, and an advance party will be waiting to greet me.${prompt};
However, I must complete the journey across the Uleguerand Range alone.;
Without a map of the area, I foresee much backtracking and other such delays I cannot afford.${prompt};
Though I am reluctant to do so, I will meet with my nephew, Antreneau.;
As a Royal Knight, he will have access to the charts I require.${prompt};

Basic rules.;

Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
You say your travels have taken you to the windswept meadows of Tavnazia. Many a moon has passed since that name befell my ears.${prompt};
However, with your arrival, forgotten memories of the Marquisate have arisen from the nooks of my mind, not unlike clear mountain water bubbles from a spring.;
Yes, I remember when the streets were filled with crafts and produce carried by countless merchants from the distant archipelago.${prompt};
Why, when Lady Femitte was but a child, I would often use ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} when preparing her supper. Oh, how she adored its savory aroma.${prompt};
I wonder if the spice still grows among the trees of Cape Riverne...${prompt};
What is this you say? Forces otherworldly have ripped asunder the quiet fields, leaving the cape in utter ruin? My, then I could not possibly ask you to risk your life for something as simple as an herb.${prompt};
If, by some wonderful miracle, you find yourself in possession of a sprig of ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, then I should dearly love to prepare Lady Femitte some authentic Tavnazian dishes once again.${prompt};
Why, this is ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}! I never imagined that I would once again be blessed with the opportunity to garnish my dishes with this succulent spice.${prompt};
As I am but a simple maidservant, I have little to offer you in return.;
Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt};
A fine young merchant from Tavnazia would often stop by the manor and give me these before heading to the cathedral to do business with the priests. But that was long ago...${prompt};
What is all the excitement, Rouva? I have not seen you this delighted in ages.${prompt};
Yes, my lady. This fine adventurer has brought us a sprig of ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}!${prompt};
No, what I meant was that you looked awfully delighted when you were talking of that fine young merchant. Perchance you had a fancy for the exotic lad from a faraway land?${prompt};
Lady Femitte! I... I...;
Long ago I cleansed my mind of such thoughts impure.${prompt};
While at one time my heart may have raced at the sound of the merchant's footsteps nearing the manor door, I brushed those feelings aside after hearing rumors that he married one of the cathedral theologians and moved back to Tavnazia. It would be a sin for me to long after someone bound to another.${prompt};
But...;
I can only hope that he escaped the flames of war that crossed his land twenty years ago...${prompt};
May the Goddess have mercy on young Despachiaire...${prompt};
Thanks to your unselfish act of kindness, I was able to serve my lady a taste from her childhood.${prompt};
If your path in life leads you once again to the fields of Riverne, it would be much appreciated if you might stop and collect another sprig of ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} for Lady Femitte.${prompt};
No... I cannot ask you to go out of your way for such a trivial task. Forget the words I have spoken...${prompt};
My name is Sobane, and my husband is the royal family's head chef.${prompt};
Just recently, he told me the most unsettling news.;
Thus I was impelled to seek the aid of an adventurer...${prompt};
If word of my request reaches the wrong ears, it may place my family in danger.${prompt};
Should you decide to take up my request, would you be willing to swear a blood oath?${prompt};
You must swear to Altana, Goddess of the Dawn, to breathe not a single syllable of this matter to anyone...${prompt};
Do you swear?;
${selection-lines};
On my honor.;
Only when I hurt myself...${prompt};
My thanks.;
As proof of your oath, I ask that you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
My family's fate is in your hands.${prompt};
I see.;
It was foolish of me to expect an adventurer to accept such a binding agreement. I will think of some other way...${prompt};
As proof of your oath, I ask that you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Thank you, adventurer.;
I accept this ${item-singular: 1[2]} as proof of your word.${prompt};
I once again insist that you breathe not a word of this to anyone.;
Now, to the matter at hand.${prompt};
Several days ago, Count Varonbiriaux M Teulomme was granted audience with the royaulais.${prompt};
Do you know of Count Teulomme?;
He resides in a mansion built within the Carpenters' Landing territory.${prompt};
Thirty years ago, those lands belonged to the Knights Mistalle.${prompt};
However, the head of the family, Francmage M Mistalle, lost his life under mysterious circumstances...${prompt};
His inexplicable death dealt a terrible blow to the knights.${prompt};
Francmage's only son and member of the Royal Knights, Leservieus M Mistalle, was swept up in a whirlwind of rage and despair.${prompt};
He became embroiled in an argument with Lord Epuliphont, a Temple Knight with whom he was not on good terms.;
Enraged by the slanderous conjecture on his father's fate, Leservieus challenged Epuliphont to a duel to the death.${prompt};
As has always been the case in San d'Oria, duels are strictly forbidden by law.${prompt};
When word of their battle reached the royal court, both families were stripped of their titles, and Leservieus's wife returned to Selbina with her infant child in tow.${prompt};
Thirty years have passed since that time.${prompt};
The son born to Leservieus and his wife grew up to become a magnificent knight.${prompt};
He has embarked on a journey to redeem his family's name.${prompt};
When Count Teulomme learned of this, he ordered his vassals to search for this heir to the Knights Mistalle.${prompt};
The count, under the pretext of wishing to know the truth of what happened thirty years ago, is offering to assist the knight in his endeavor...${prompt};
However, the count's cook believes that Teulomme is more concerned with losing his lands to their rightful owner.${prompt};
Please do not take a cook's words lightly.;
Much information reaches a man who prepares the meals for a household.${prompt};
If Count Teulomme is truly seeking to cause harm to the heir of the Knights Mistalle, we have a duty to warn him of the danger.${prompt};
I am certain an adventurer of your caliber will be able to locate this man before anything untoward occurs.${prompt};
Please find the knight of Mistalle. He must know of the threat to his life.${prompt};
Is Count Teulomme truly searching for the knight of Mistalle to cause him harm?${prompt};
I ask that you find this knight and warn him of the danger he is in.${prompt};
I know not where he presently resides...${prompt};
But it is possible his mother, the Lady Leffine, yet abides in the town of Selbina.${prompt};
Atarefaunet's Band!?${prompt};
That is a frightening name indeed.${prompt};
That despicable group of brigands terrorized the length and breadth of the Quon continent when I was a child.${prompt};
They would prowl the trade routes between San d'Oria, Bastok, Jeuno, and Tavnazia, and attack any merchants they came across.${prompt};
They showed no mercy to man, woman, or child, and used the goods and information they obtained to threaten and blackmail others.;
They were far worse than a mere gang of thieves.${prompt};
But near the end of the Great War, their leader--Atarefaunet--was finally caught by bounty hunters.${prompt};
Atarefaunet was brought here to San d'Oria and executed soon after.${prompt};
The remaining members of the band scattered to the corners of Vana'diel, and are still in hiding to this day.${prompt};
Could it be possible that Count Teulomme has employed members of Atarefaunet's Band?${prompt};
And these villains are searching for Lady Leffine's son, Louverance...${prompt};
Things are far worse than I feared.;
Hearing of the involvement of Atarefaunet's Band fills me with dread.${prompt};
Here is your reward.;
I beg of you, adventurer, do not speak a word of this to anyone.${prompt};
Stay on your guard, ${name-player}.;
And please, do not speak a word of this to anyone.${prompt};
${name-player}.;
Your timing is most fortunate.${prompt};
My husband has something he wishes to discuss with you.${prompt};
You are the adventurer who carried out my wife's request?${prompt};
She seems to hold you in high regard, but do you truly have the skills required to live up to that trust?${prompt};
You would do well not to sign an oath in blood so lightly.${prompt};
The blood oath signed by the families of Mistalle and Revemel served as evidence of their duel when the case was brought before the royal court.${prompt};
Both families were severely punished for their actions.${prompt};
This matter does not concern me personally. However, my wife's mother, who worked for the Revemel family, was accused of handing over that oath.${prompt};
My mother is innocent of this charge, but her pleas fell on deaf ears.${prompt};
Now perhaps you see why Sobane is so adamant in her pursuit of the truth.${prompt};
Although I may be the head chef for the royal family, I am still naught but a simple cook.;
I have no interest in raising knights and joining the noble families' struggle for power.${prompt};
Whatever underhanded deals were made or plans hatched, it is all in the past.${prompt};
There is nothing to be gained by staring at an empty plate once the food has been eaten.${prompt};
I understand what you wish to say, dearest.${prompt};
However, we must take responsibility for the future.${prompt};
Louverance Mistalle must be warned of the threat to his life...${prompt};
Even though you have never met the knight in question?${prompt};
As the chef for the Teulomme family tells it, the count is facing threats from some unknown personage.${prompt};
For all we know, it could be this Louverance you seek to protect.;
Count Teulomme would then be well justified in his efforts to track him down.${prompt};
Louverance was raised in the town of Selbina, and has received no formal knightly training.${prompt};
After reaching manhood, he traveled to San d'Oria with great prospects of joining the Royal Knights. His decision to give up this chance does not speak highly of his character.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But it would be a mistake to judge him based on those facts alone.${prompt};
That is why I would like you to confirm something for us, adventurer.${prompt};
Is the person threatening Count Teulomme really this Louverance, or some other character who has strayed from the knightly path?${prompt};
Apparently, the count has yet to respond to his tormentor.${prompt};
According to the chef, the criminal has said that he can be contacted through one of the Tonberries of Carpenters' Landing.${prompt};
That is all I know.;
I must return to my duties in the chateau.;
Sobane, be wary of strangers.${prompt};
Yes, dear...${prompt};
I wonder if Sir Louverance is the one threatening Count Teulomme, as my husband suggests.${prompt};
The criminal has said that he can be contacted through one of the Tonberries of Carpenters' Landing.${prompt};
${name-player}.;
Please help me to uncover the truth.${prompt};
${name-player}, you look exhausted.;
This request has been hard on you.${prompt};
You have discovered the identity of the one threatening Count Teulomme?;
And it was not Sir Louverance?${prompt};
You confirmed Louverance's innocence, but you were not able to learn the nature of the threats...${prompt};
Thank you for investigating this matter, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I know where Louverance can be found.;
A knight returning from the Northlands brought me the tale.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
It seems Louverance wasn't the villain after all.${prompt};
I was assured by a knight well known to me that the descendant of the Mistalle line is a splendid character who upholds the pride of his family name.${prompt};
He even went so far as to say that Louverance's actions were responsible for saving his life.${prompt};
He also promised me a letter would be composed and sent to Louverance to warn him of the potential danger from Count Teulomme.${prompt};
Does that satisfy you, Sobane?${prompt};
Yes, I believe that should be sufficient.;
Thank you, Ondieumais.${prompt};
Then I shall return to the chateau.${prompt};
I must extend my thanks to you as well, ${name-player}.;
Hopefully, Sir Louverance will now at least be aware of the threat to his life.${prompt};
Please take this as payment for your services.${prompt};
Hey!;
You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right?;
Take this letter to that ${choice: 2}[cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?${prompt};

Have you seen the trees? Have you seen the trees?;
It must be that time of the year again, kupo! Time for the Starlight Celebration, kupo!${prompt};
I've even heard rumors that the craftsman that built the trees has crossed the seven or so seas to work here in San d'Oria, kupo!${prompt};
And if that's not enough, there's this strange character in a red hat calling himself a “smilebringer” that's been associating with the city's little people!${prompt};
He said he was here to deliver love and happiness, but I can't trust that outsider. If anything were to happen to San d'Oria's children...;
That's why I've been keeping an eye on the guy by pretending to help him and his underlings, kupo!${prompt};

Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
You're not wearing your yukata!;
Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!;
I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt};
Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!;
When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
Incredible, kupo!;
You must have nerves of darksteel!;
Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
You haven't earned my really special present yet!;
Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt};
Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?;
I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt};
Here, take this as a testament to your courage.;
Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt};
Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!;
Kupupupu...${prompt};
This place is crawling with nasties.;
You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt};
Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt};
I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.;
This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt};
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt};
Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.${prompt};
Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?${prompt};
Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!${prompt};
You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.${prompt};
This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.${prompt};
But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!${prompt};
It's just not fair, kupo!${prompt};
Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!${prompt};
And that's why we need your help, kupo!;
Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?${prompt};
There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!${prompt};
For starters, why don't you try finding ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!${prompt};
Great! A whole set, kupo!;
Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole.;
Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo!;
We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!${prompt};
Wow! Another set!;
You don't know how much this means to us, kupo!;
Here, take this!${prompt};
Why, ${name-player}!;
You are acquainted with the Tavnazian merchant of whom we spoke?${prompt};
What a stroke of luck, Rouva.;
You have done nothing but daydream about that merchant since the last time ${name-player} graced us with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] presence.${prompt};
Lady Femitte! Are you implying that I...?${prompt};
But our discussion veers off course again.;
We were speaking of Despachiaire's late wife.;
What a lovely voice she had! Quite a rare talent at the time, I recall.${prompt};
She was as fair of face as she was in song...;
Though it shames me to admit it, I was rather envious of the dashing couple they made together.${prompt};
Despachiaire and his beloved were often the source of gossip among the young ladies.;
I am certain there are others who remember the pair as well as I.${prompt};
In fact, the tale of the cathedral choirgirl and the Tavnazian merchant became quite the scandal.${prompt};
After he whisked his love away to Tavnazia, I believe this...attention...prevented Despachiaire from ever returning to San d'Oria...${prompt};
As for this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} you have brought to me...${prompt};
I am not completely certain of its origin, but judging from its shape, I would guess this to be an artifact of the San d'Orian Cathedral.${prompt};
The inscription is a little difficult to make out...${prompt};
Perhaps if you polish it with the spores of the glowing mushrooms found near Carpenters' Landing, the letters will become clear enough to read...${prompt};
An elderly woman's trivial knowledge...;
Young people these days are so quick to divest themselves of anything showing signs of wear...${prompt};
If you ever find yourself in the vicinity of Carpenters' Landing, seek out one of the mushrooms I mentioned.${prompt};
I may be able to tell you more once the inscription has become readable.;
Until then, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I see you found your way to Carpenters' Landing.;
And you have done a fine job with the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
It is just as I supposed...;
This is an amulet made by the San d'Orian Cathedral and inscribed with the words of a famous saint.${prompt};
Ah yes, the letters are now faintly legible. Though I doubt they would be noticed by anyone unaware of their existence...;
The inscription reads:${prompt};
“Regrets wilt not plague a heart filled with faith.”${prompt};
I have heard those words before at the cathedral.;
A “heart filled with faith” referred to belief in the Goddess, however...${prompt};
Yes, I am sure the owner of this amulet applied these words to more than just religious matters.${prompt};
Oh, dear me.;
I do believe I have a touch of jealousy.;
Lady Femitte, you will lead my thoughts in such improper directions!${prompt};
Please convey my greetings to Despachiaire when you return to Tavnazia.${prompt};
Have you seen the decorations?;
The Doll Festival has started, kupo!${prompt};
I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.${prompt};
Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.${prompt};
Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well?;
We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!${prompt};
It looks like you have all the members you need.;
Time for the festival to begin, kupo!${prompt};
After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival.;
Here, you take one as well, kupo!${prompt};
It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!${prompt};
In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!${prompt};
As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, “resourcefulness,” I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!${prompt};
Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress.;
Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!${prompt};
And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor.;
I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo!?;
Something's not right...;
Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...;
I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.${prompt};
You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!${prompt};
You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You obtain 3 ${item-plural: 0[2]}, 3 ${item-plural: 1[2]}, 3 ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and 3 ${item-plural: 3[2]}!${prompt};
Kupo?;
What happened to your ten-person party?;
You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!${prompt};
Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!;
Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt};
You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.;
Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hey!;
Your party has different members all of a sudden!;
Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt};
Hey!;
Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!;
You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt};
Hmm...;
You seem to have lost your male element.;
Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt};
At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt};
You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.;
Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt};
We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt};
Have you seen one?;
${selection-lines};
Indeed I have.;
I'm not quite sure...${prompt};
Aha, so you have firsthand experience.;
You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt};
The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt};
My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.;
Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt};
I wish to know about the ENM in...;
${selection-lines};
Nowhere in particular.;
The Spire of Holla.;
The Spire of Dem.;
The Spire of Mea.;
The Spire of Vahzl.;
Monarch Linn.;
The Shrouded Maw.;
Mine Shaft #2716.;
Bearclaw Pinnacle.;
Boneyard Gully.${prompt};
You won't be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt};
The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt};
You have no need of my expertise at the moment?;
Very well.${prompt};
And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt};
If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt};
These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.;
They must be destroyed.${prompt};
I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...${prompt};
Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.${prompt};
I hope I have been of some assistance to you.${prompt};
This dark plague grows ever stronger...;
If it is not stopped soon...${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt};
We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!;
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt};
Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.;
They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt};
Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!;
Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
With all the aura you've absorbed with the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, we've managed to create a new weapon.;
We'd like you to have it, kupo!${prompt};
I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt};
After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt};
A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--;
Kupopo!?${prompt};
The moogle appears to have received a message...!;
G-grave news, kupo!!!;
Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt};
Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt};
Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!;
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt};
We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt};
To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
When you plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!${prompt};
Alright then!;
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!${prompt};
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!;
Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt};
A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt};
Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt};
But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! Great!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt};
The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! I like your enthusiasm!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have in your possession, kupo!${prompt};
Nooo, that ${item-singular: 0[2]} won't do.;
Come back again after you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo!;
You've absorbed ${choice: 0}[a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!${prompt};
Thanks, kupo.;
We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!${prompt};
You can purify absorbed malice by planting your ${item-singular: 0[2]} here.${prompt};
A mysterious power absorbs the malice!${prompt};
Please select absorption value.;

${name-player}, how lovely to see you!;
I...oh?${prompt};
I've finally found you, adventurer!;
Many a sleepless night have I spent on your trail!${prompt};
Did you relay my message to that rogue?${prompt};
I must apologize for the rude intrusion, Lady Hinaree, but this is a matter of life and death.${prompt};
You must know, adventurer!;
Where is that common-born cad!?${prompt};
Common-born?;
Sir Louverance, might you be speaking of the man in the red mask?${prompt};
If that scoundrel laid so much as a finger upon you...!${prompt};
Calm yourself, noble knight.${prompt};
As it happens, this gentleman holds a message for you from the very man you seek.${prompt};
A message!?;
What does it say!?${prompt};
It reads, “I await you in the Uleguerand Range. As a knight of honor, I challenge you to a duel.”${prompt};
Such a hot-headed young man.${prompt};
Might you follow him to Uleguerand and see that he returns safely?${prompt};
What do you shout?;
${selection-lines};
Stop this, Louverance!;
Which one of you is Louverance!?${prompt};
Hahaha!;
My arduous training has finally paid off!${prompt};
You should spend your next life as a friar, my friend!;
You have much to do penance for!${prompt};
Thank you for the distraction, ${name-player}.${prompt};
It appears the villain underestimated me.${prompt};
I am not the man I once was. After my defeat to a dread dragon, I honed my battle skills to a much finer edge.${prompt};
I have pledged myself to defend the peace of this world!${prompt};
My path lies beyond the Shadow Lord and the Dark Divinity.;
The mysterious Keeper of the Apocalypse is my true opponent!${prompt};
Ah, but I have said too much.;
You must leave this ultimate blackguard to me.${prompt};
Let us meet again when the world has been made a safer place by Louverance N Mistalle!${prompt};
I must say, I feared blood would be spilled when I witnessed the hostile demeanor of that young knight.;
Praise Altana that he returned to us unharmed.${prompt};
Oh my.;
You say that his opponent was not as fortunate?${prompt};
How dreadful.;
Shall I offer up a prayer for this poor soul?${prompt};
Ask the friar to pray?;
${selection-lines};
Please.;
It's a little late for that...${prompt};
Well, well...;
The spirit of that man has this to say to you:${prompt};
“If you had not ruined the trap I set at Carpenters' Landing, there would have been no reason for me to die.”${prompt};
Do you fear the restless dead, perhaps?;
Well, the spirit of that man has this to say to you:${prompt};
Your lack of reaction is most disconcerting.;
Do you tire of my performance?${prompt};
I suppose it is not surprising, considering the phenomenal events you have witnessed.${prompt};
Then let us toast our reunion, and the continuing existence of this dreary world.${prompt};
When I think of the danger we faced to avert catastrophe...;
The blissful ignorance around me is somehow infuriating.${prompt};
The only things that have been disturbed here are our individual fates.;
If events had proceeded according to plan, I would have been able to receive aid from the Western Kingdom in the restoration of Tavnazia...${prompt};
However, the precious Star of Tavnazia was lost when Prishe hurled it into the face of Promathia...${prompt};
And doing anything to incur the wrath of the cardinal would be foolish, now that I know her true identity.${prompt};
In any case, I have lost interest in prying open the Gates of Paradise after seeing the land of Al'Taieu with my own eyes.${prompt};
But all was not in vain.;
The name I have lived under for so long need be my prison no more.${prompt};
It is far easier to play the role of a common man than to become a reckless fool, you know.${prompt};
After meeting him so many times, you must be aware of the Mistalle family traits.;
A line of hotheads, would-be heroes...${prompt};
And complete idiots.;
Can you believe the man was so eager to accept a duel to the death?;
The very thing that soiled his family name to begin with...${prompt};
Hm?;
His stupidity made it possible to tie up all the loose ends with a simple “performance”?${prompt};
You are correct, my friend.;
Now all that remains is to change my name and set out on the road once more.${prompt};
With the power of the Mimeo Mirror at my disposal, I can coerce any noble with shady secrets into my service.${prompt};
I will restore the Marquisate, create a new order of knights...${prompt};
And resurrect the Remevel name.${prompt};
There is but one thing I have in common with Louverance:${prompt};
The unyielding desire to sear my name into the pages of history.${prompt};
I take my leave of you.;
Farewell, ${name-player}.${prompt};
...${prompt};
...Outta my face, ${choice-player-gender}[buddy/lady].${prompt};
I told you to scram! Or would you like a piece of me, huh? If I didn't have to waste my time bundlin' together ninja tools for sissy adventurers like you, I'd fill your ugly mug with bloody bolts faster than you could say Galkan sausage.${prompt};
Eh? You're here to get your ninja tools bundled?;
Curse Altana! And people ask me why I hate this stinkin' job!${prompt};
Well, don't just stand there like an idiot! I can't do any bundlin' until you fork over a set of 99 tools and ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!;
And I ain't doin' no more than seven sets at one time, so don't even try it!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks like he's ready to bite off the head of a baby coeurl...;
What the hell is this!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!${prompt};
Can't you see I'm busy right now!? Go play with your mommy, sissy!${prompt};
Here, take 'em and scram.;
And don't say I ain't never did nothin' for you!${prompt};
What the hell is this junk!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!${prompt};
Festival time, kupo～!!!;
"We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called ""Azimuth Circle""!${prompt}";
Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!;
First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt};
After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt};
However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt};
At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt};
Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo!;
To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo!;
Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.;
If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!${prompt};
Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?${prompt};
Play the game?;
${selection-lines};
Ready to go!;
I'll pass.${prompt};
When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt};
If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt};
Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt};
Well, kupo?;
You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt};
Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, freedom!;
I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt};
Your game has been cancelled.;
If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!${prompt};
You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!;
Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt};
We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo～!${prompt};
The direction of your partner's checkpoint is ${choice: 0}[east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!${prompt};
There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing ${choice: 0}[east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].${prompt};
You see something lying on the ground!${prompt};
You cannot check any more checkpoints.${prompt};
Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt};
We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt};
Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt};
But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt};
If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt};
Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!;
Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt};
It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt};
We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt};
We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt};
Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt};
There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt};
You'll help us out, kupo?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a try.;
I have other things to do.${prompt};
Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.${prompt};
This card is addressed to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, kupo!${prompt};

I've been waiting!;
I've got a present for you, kupo!${prompt};
I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!${prompt};
I need you to give this card to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!${prompt};
I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!${prompt};
Did you hand out the ${item-singular: 0[2]} yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.${prompt};
You forgot who to give the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to?;
You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!${prompt};
Do you have any items that you just can't let go of because of the fond memories attached to them? Are you worried about the space they take up in your Mog House? Well, worry no longer--I can store your items here!${prompt};
Do you require my services?;
${selection-lines};
Not now, thanks.;
Tell me what I can store.;
Remove an item from storage.${prompt};
Please select which type of item you would like to know about.${prompt};

Remove which item from storage?;
${selection-lines};
I've changed my mind.;
A fee of 250 gil is required.;
Will you remove the ${item-singular: 0[2]} from storage?${prompt};
Do you wish to pay the fee?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not at this time.${prompt};
Do not worry. Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is in good hands.${prompt};
You currently have no items in storage.${prompt};
Looking for someone, are we?;
Can you give me a description?${prompt};
As a matter of fact, I think the person you're searching for just walked in a few moments ago.;
Probably still making some purchases upstairs.${prompt};
...Yes, that's right.;

An unusual pearl...;
Is that not the person you were speaking of?${prompt};
I think you've missed your chance.;
Or perhaps you changed your mind?${prompt};
Love is in the air!;
It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!${prompt};
There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!${prompt};
Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that “special someone”!${prompt};
We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!${prompt};
Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.${prompt};
There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!${prompt};
When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.${prompt};
You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.${prompt};
Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.${prompt};
When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.${prompt};
If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!${prompt};
Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo～.${prompt};
We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!${prompt};
Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!${prompt};
After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!${prompt};
While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho～!${prompt};
Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!${prompt};
Want to try again?;
Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!${prompt};
Something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Something wrong?;
${selection-lines};
Listen to the rules again.;
Give up.;
Not really.${prompt};
Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
You aren't planning on giving up, are you?${prompt};
Quit the game?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.${prompt};
Really give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes!;
No, not yet!${prompt};
Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo?;
You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings!;
...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?${prompt};
You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
What a beautiful piece of chocolate!;
No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!${prompt};
Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...${prompt};
Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!${prompt};
Decent. You score ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.${prompt};
Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.${prompt};
My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!${prompt};
Which item would you like?;
${selection-lines};
Let me think.;
Are you absolutely sure, kupo?${prompt};
You really want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, that's the one!;
On second thought...${prompt};
You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.${prompt};
You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!${prompt};
Oh, I've been waiting for this moment!;
You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!${prompt};
Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!${prompt};
You still haven't brought any chocolate?;
I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!${prompt};
Hey, what do you want?;
You could go see a moogle or something!${prompt};
<gasp>!;
Y-you brought me a chocolate!;
I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!${prompt};
Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.${prompt};
Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like ${choice: 3}[Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.${prompt};
What? Still...?;
Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.${prompt};
What do you want?;
I don't think I know you.${prompt};
Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all.;
I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.${prompt};
I have been waiting all my life for this!;
You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!${prompt};
Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest] ${choice: 3}[Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!${prompt};
Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!${prompt};
What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!${prompt};
Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me!;
I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live ${choice-player-gender}[girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!${prompt};
N-no way!;
I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!${prompt};
Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!${prompt};
Ahhh!;
By Altana, you scared me!;
Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!${prompt};
What!?;
...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!${prompt};
Ahhh!;
You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!${prompt};
Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!${prompt};
Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!${prompt};
What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!${prompt};
Hm? Want something?;
You should go talk to a moogle!${prompt};
Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!${prompt};
Why, hello!;
This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.${prompt};
Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!${prompt};
Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful!;
But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!${prompt};
Yes? You have a question?;
Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!${prompt};
Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much!;
I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it.;
I hope you meet someone special, too!${prompt};
Aaah!;
Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is...;
<sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!${prompt};
A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)${prompt};
Eep!;
Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know!;
Anyway, good luck!${prompt};
Y-yes? What is it?;
I...um, I don't need anything...${prompt};
What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!${prompt};
Hello...;
I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...${prompt};
Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.${prompt};
You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you?;
I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...${prompt};
What's the matter?;
I don't think there's anything I need...${prompt};
I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
The design on that badge...;
Is it, perchance, related to that mercenary company all of San d'Oria is gossiping about?;
The Near East...${prompt};
You adventurers always seem to be two steps ahead.;
If only my fellow countrymen were as perceptive...${prompt};
When the unknown looms before us, you venture forth to learn the truth with your own eyes.;
Ah, an adventurer's life...${prompt};
I have not the stamina for such foolishness anymore.;
But do come and make an old woman smile with tales of far-off lands, should you ever have the time.${prompt};
Wow! I wish I had a badge like that!;
Are they going to let you join the mercenaries?;
I was thinking of becoming a mercenary, too, one day...${prompt};
Do you think they would let me in?;
Maybe I should try defeating a few fiends first.${prompt};
Hey you! What's with the badge!?;
I'm the only one worthy of the honor around this place!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Daggao's badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
Those Near Eastern folk have been talking their company up so much, everyone's starting to smell a rat.${prompt};
But you know, only the strongest adventurers are being accepted.;
This is a chance to finally show my mettle!${prompt};
I doubt they'll take a runt like you!;
Gwahahahahaha!${prompt};
Ah!? Th-that badge!;
Is it not a symbol of that mercenary company offering the incredible rewards?${prompt};
A mercenary's life...;
If I am doomed to remain a gate guard, perhaps I, too, should put in an application.${prompt};
But, no.;
I cannot forsake my duty.;
I will work my way towards glory one step at a time.${prompt};
You there! Yes, you!;
You are one of those “adventurers”?${prompt};
Are you an “adventurer”?;
${selection-lines};
I guess I am.;
Not today.${prompt};
I knew it to be so!;
This badge was made for one such as you!;
Allow me...!${prompt};
No!? A thousand pardons!;
And yet, you shall make the perfect bearer for this badge!;
Allow me...!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is suddenly pinned to ${name-player}!${prompt};
This is the symbol of the illustrious leader of Salaheem's Sentinels--a snarling wildcat.${prompt};
Under the authorization of Her Imperial Majesty, Salaheem's Sentinels is a well-respected company that specializes in training and dispatching mercenaries for the defense of the Aht Urhgan Empire.;
We have a myriad of well-paying missions ready for any able-bodied adventurer.${prompt};
But my speech grows overlong! My dauntless commander has bid me take ship to this bountiful kingdom and dazzle the citizenry with the Sentinels' splendor, and so I shall!${prompt};
Oho! It is you!;
It would appear that more and more people are taking an interest in our humble organization.;
Praise be to the winds of fortune!${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was created through the advanced alchemical techniques of my country. The wildcat's eyes are designed to flash in the presence of any who entertain thoughts of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Aha! My splendid friend!;
You have spread the fire of fascination through the entire city!;
Salaheem's Sentinels is the talk of the town!${prompt};
Hm?;
It appears the eyes of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} have lost their luster. The crystal power source must have been drained after dazzling so many people.;
Allow me to remove this spent trinket...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is taken from ${name-player}!${prompt};
In return, I shall award you this bauble.;
It will come in handy for when you join the ranks of the Aht Urhgan mercenaries!${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your name will shine down through the ages as one of our finest public relations officers. Should you ever brave the seas and find yourself in the Imperial City of Al Zahbi, you simply must visit the offices of Salaheem's Sentinels.;
I insist!${prompt};
Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!${prompt};
We've got items for everyone!;
Here you go, kupo!${prompt};
Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!${prompt};
You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
You obtain ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 2[2]}, and ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}!${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt};
The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!;
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!${prompt};
And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!${prompt};
Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt};
Want to know more?;
${selection-lines};
Fill me in!;
I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt};
To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt};
So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt};
Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt};
We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt};
The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt};
What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt};
And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt};
Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt};
But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt};
And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt};
So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt};
Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt};
You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt};
Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt};
Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt};
Is this partner okay with you?;
${selection-lines};
Perfect!;
I want to go with someone else...${prompt};
Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo?;
Where'd your partner go?${prompt};
I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt};
I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo! Congratulations!;
You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt};
Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt};
We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt};
It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt};
Leave town?;
${selection-lines};
Send me out!;
Not yet...${prompt};
Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt};
Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt};
If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt};
I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt};
Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.;
If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt};
What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt};
Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt};
Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};
Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.;
You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt};
What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt};
Start over?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No thanks.${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
And that's not all!;
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};
Well done!;
On to the next one, kupo!${prompt};
That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt};
Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!;
If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt};
Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt};
The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt};
Kweh!!!${prompt};
Kweeeh!♪${prompt};
All seem to be in attendance, so let us begin.${prompt};
You are gathered here today to discuss the reasons for the recent changes in chocobo behavior.${prompt};
Speak for yourself. The chocobos in Bastok seem to be doing just fine.${prompt};
No problems in Windurst, either.${prompt};
This problem currently affects the nations of San d'Oria and Jeuno. It is only a matter of time before it spreads to Windurst and Bastok as well.${prompt};
What's that? This might affect Windurst? Well, what are you waiting for? Out with it, now!${prompt};
Recently, a chocobo escaped from these stables.${prompt};
I managed to find her and bring her back, but she has been acting strangely ever since.${prompt};
She often has her head in the clouds, has developed a temper, and always appears restless...${prompt};
Why, the same thing happened to a chocobo at my stable!${prompt};
The two of you should keep a closer watch on your chocobos. You have nobody to blame but yourselves.${prompt};
You're right... I never should've mentioned wild chocobos in front of him...${prompt};
Wild chocobos?${prompt};
Yes. The chocobo escaped as soon as I finished talking to this adventurer here...${prompt};
And that's when he started behaving strangely? Could it be...?${prompt};
It has to be...the call of the wild.${prompt};
Oh, give me a break... These chocobos were raised in a stable, for Altana's sake!${prompt};
No. We must not rule out the possibility. Like Brutus, I also discovered my chocobo on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
And to make matters worse, the problem is spreading to the other chocobos.${prompt};
What are you saying? People and chocobos have a special bond, not broken so easily!${prompt};
You have to remember that chocobos are animals. They'll return to the wild if given the chance.${prompt};
This issue has the potential to cause great disorder among the chocobos if left unchecked. We must formulate a solution without delay.${prompt};
I think the problem lies in the very way we raise and train our chocobos.${prompt};
We've already debated this issue, right? We even just finished reforming the system!${prompt};
I still think it needs more work. We've been too slack on discipline.${prompt};
Raisin' chocobos is not just about discipline! We've had this discussion before!${prompt};
Then how do you explain our current problem? It'll be our responsibility if one of the chocobos harms someone!${prompt};
Settle down, both of you.${prompt};
We have grown so used to these types of discussions that we have lost sight of the big picture.${prompt};
I think we should ask this adventurer here for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] opinion.${prompt};
You're right. That's why I invited ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] here, after all.${prompt};
What do you suggest?;
${selection-lines};
Return the chocobos to the wild.;
Give the chocobos a rest.;
Reform the chocobo raising system.;
Bring the chocobos together.${prompt};
But the chocobo stables would have to close, and we'd be out of our jobs!${prompt};
We could make a much better decision without this adventurer.${prompt};
You may be right...${prompt};
Wait!;
Let's give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] another chance.${prompt};
...Fine.;
Let us hear what you have to say, ${name-player}.${prompt};
That would just give them lots of free time to think about returning to the wild, wouldn't it?${prompt};
See? Even ${name-player} agrees.${prompt};
You just don't know when to quit, do you?${prompt};
Please!${prompt};
That would just make them twice as bad, wouldn't it?${prompt};
Wait!;
We don't know until we try, right? Let's bring 'em both together!${prompt};
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?${prompt};
I think this adventurer is onto something. Besides, we're not going to solve anything by talking. We should give it a try!${prompt};
Well... If you feel that strongly about it...${prompt};
I guess that's it, then!;
I'll head for Jeuno later.${prompt};
This is such a waste of time...${prompt};
Do you really think this plan will work?${prompt};
Great. I'm behind ya all the way!${prompt};
Please make your way to the chocobo stables in Jeuno. I will bring the chocobo with me when I have finished my preparations.${prompt};
I am Hantileon, President of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society.${prompt};
You also seem to like chocobos... I can tell by the look in your eyes. I will allow you to join our society.${prompt};
Trade an egg to me if you want to start raising a chocobo.${prompt};
You seem to be raising a chocobo at another nation's stables. Just ask Arvilauge if you have any questions.${prompt};
Hello there!;
Your chocobo should be fully grown in no time!${prompt};
This week's schedule:;
${selection-lines};
Minimum care (no charge).;
Emphasis on exercise (1200 gil).;
Physical training (1300 gil).;
Rest (1500 gil).;
Ask about current condition.;
Ask for a care report.;
Never mind.${prompt};
All you want for your chocobo this week is the minimum level of care? There is no charge for this service, but it will not help your chocobo grow...${prompt};
An emphasis on exercise, is it? Your chocobo will run and build leg strength with this program.${prompt};
Physical training, is it? Your chocobo will spend time exploring outside and digging with this program. It should help your animal build a strong beak and claws.${prompt};
Giving your chocobo a rest will allow it to recover from accumulated fatigue and restore a great deal of energy.${prompt};
Choose this program?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Understood. Your chocobo is in good hands with us this week.${prompt};
Changed your mind? When you decide on a program, please let me know. If there is no word from you, we will continue to give your chocobo the minimum level of care.${prompt};
You seem to be raising your chocobo well.${prompt};
It does not seem to have any serious illness or sudden changes in temperament. Everything looks to be in perfect order.${prompt};
All that you have been providing for your chocobo is the minimum level of care. As a result...${prompt};
Your chocobo's legs are a bit stronger than average...${prompt};
But its overall physical strength is a bit lower than average.${prompt};
Come back any time. Your chocobo is counting on you!${prompt};
（ここでなんかみせられるといいな）${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
(It seems to be in good spirits.)${prompt};
Kweh.${prompt};

No.${prompt};
You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...${prompt};
If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.${prompt};
When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.${prompt};
Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.${prompt};
Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. You should try wandering out just a bit sometimes. It might tire your chocobo a bit, but could have some positive effects as well.${prompt};
Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. Wandering far from town on a walk will expose your chocobo to all sorts of new experiences!${prompt};

You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};

You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?${prompt};
What would you like to say?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!${prompt};
You really want to retire your chocobo?${prompt};
Retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};

Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!${prompt};

The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.${prompt};
They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.${prompt};
Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt};
They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt};
The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt};
But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!${prompt};
Ask about which attribute?;
${selection-lines};
Strength.;
Endurance.;
Discernment.;
Receptivity.;
Energy.;
Affection.;
Satisfaction.;
Nothing.${prompt};
“Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt};
You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt};
“Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt};
You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt};
If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt};
“Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt};
However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
What is a care schedule?;
Basic care.;
Resting.;
Taking a walk.;
Listening to music.;
Exercising alone.;
Exercising in a group.;
Interacting with children.;
Interacting with chocobos.;
Carrying packages.;
Exhibiting to the public.;
Delivering messages.;
Digging for treasure.;
Acting in a play.;
Nothing.${prompt};
A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt};
How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt};
You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt};
When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt};
With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt};
The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt};
You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt};
The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt};
However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt};
We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt};
Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt};
Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt};
However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt};
But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt};
The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt};
You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
A general explanation.;
Watching over your chocobo.;
Telling a story.;
Scolding.;
Competing.;
Taking a walk.;
Nothing.${prompt};
In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt};
On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt};
However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt};
You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt};
You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt};
I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt};
Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt};
This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt};
Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt};
I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt};
Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Why feeding is important.;
Vegetables.;
Wildgrasses.;
Carrots.;
Worms.;
Medicines.;
Pastes.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt};
However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt};
The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt};
At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt};
Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt};
There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt};
Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt};
This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt};
Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt};
Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt};
In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt};
Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt};
Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt};
For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt};
But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt};
The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt};
Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt};
A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt};
Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt};
You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt};
Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt};
Which would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Abilities.;
Temperament.;
Weather preferences.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt};
For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt};
Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt};
But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt};
The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt};
Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt};
Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt};
Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt};
You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt};
After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt};
When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt};
You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt};
The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt};
You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt};
When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};
Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.${prompt};
If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Chococards.;
Nothing.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.${prompt};
With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.${prompt};
If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt};
You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt};
The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt};
Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt};
Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt};
If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt};
Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt};
If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};

Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been making an awful fuss at night.${prompt};
Chicks have a tendency to cry a lot, but I think this may be worse than normal...${prompt};
${name-player}, could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping soundly at night.${prompt};
I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.${prompt};
I will dispose of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!${prompt};
As you say, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...${prompt};
I gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was but a chick.${prompt};
I am afraid ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust me more than you...${prompt};
You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.${prompt};
I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
You would like to tend to this egg?${prompt};
We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It will not be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
"Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} no longer seems lonely.${prompt};
...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?${prompt};
I am not sure what to say to that!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been behaving quite spoiled as of late. You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wanted attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I am sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love, but it is feeling better now and its appetite has returned. Everything should be all right.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! I wonder what kind of name you will choose...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it awakens.${prompt};
Your chocobo should grow accustomed to its name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We have been taking good care of your egg. I cannot wait to see how the chick will look.${prompt};
We have been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It has been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It appeared to be having pleasant dreams...${prompt};
I took the chocobo on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} exercised with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${wait-35: 8}${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a child...${prompt};
...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}? Oh...oh yes! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};

However, it got a bit too carried away, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for San d'Oria.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, San d'Oria was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, San d'Oria awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You would not believe what it has found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but turned up with very few items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but did not seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. You should spend it wisely.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding your egg.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is all for now. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let us analyze your egg's current condition...${prompt};
Let us analyze ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s current condition...${prompt};
I cannot tell yet whether the chocobo will be male or female.${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo is...a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Discernment: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg does not seem to be in the best condition at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can provide it with proper care.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because West Ronfaure is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt}${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The La Theine Plateau is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should not grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Jugner Forest. Being together such a long time should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for San d'Oria, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What is this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?${prompt};
You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I can't do it anymore.;
No, I want to continue.${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?${prompt};
Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?${prompt};
If you decide to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Give up raising your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No!${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
What would you like to say?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...${prompt};
Is that so? That is a proper attitude...${prompt};
...;
I am disappointed in you.${prompt};
You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.${prompt};
I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
Are you sure you want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?${prompt};
Really retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, really!;
No, I've changed my mind!${prompt};
Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.${prompt};
Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, is it not? But have no fear...you can see it again. Keep your chin up.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I shall prepare ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
The preparations will cost ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
I have your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You may take it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I can give you a new one, but it will cost you ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And do not worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I have been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}...;
What is this all about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...${prompt};
The owner's name begins with the letter ${choice: 0}[C/L/V].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[a town information guide/a watchman/someone who delivers parcels/a merchant].${prompt};
I will do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I have gathered new information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up a moment ago. I am glad that we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions.;
Might I trouble you to choose another combination?${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.${prompt};
Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...${prompt};
I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
I think that should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby.${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is becoming one fine bird, if you ask me!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. You can get one at the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're already raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
So you'd like to tend to this egg, eh?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... Let's make a fine chocobo out of this one.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Isn't it cute? You can name it later.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a hassle when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!${prompt};
You've done a great job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air. You're a natural at this!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal!${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
"But don't worry; this won't be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. You should probably feed it better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you, eh?${prompt};
...I've got no comment on that.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm really sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I'm happy to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know it had you worried sick, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must've missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I'm sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love. Everything should be all right now... Its appetite has returned and it appears to be feeling better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! Have any great ideas?${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up.${prompt};
I am sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how the chick looks.${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It's been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much, it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been out playing with the children of Bastok. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Eh?;
Oh yeah, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it.${prompt};
We put your chocobo on exhibition. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really played to the crowds...${prompt};
But it was a little too aggressive, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Bastok.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Bastok was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, Bastok awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but didn't turn up with many items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I still can't tell whether the chocobo will be male or female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. Your chocobo is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue. You should not disturb it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes, too.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love with another chocobo.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};

Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because North Gustaberg is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Konschtat Highlands are not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Pashhow Marshlands. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Bastok, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's that? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any longer?${prompt};
Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}...;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};
I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt};
I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt};
I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt};
So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then! From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Come on, cheer up! This won't be your last meeting!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?${prompt};
Hey, don't look at me for an answer... I don't speak Chocobo, you know!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately! It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
Wow...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems really bored! You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems happier lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm so sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away! Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and it seems okay!${prompt};
I know you were just beside yourself with worry, but you should welcome your chocobo with open arms. It must've missed you a lot!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting weird lately. Its head is in the clouds and will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. That should cheer it up!${prompt};
It seems your chocobo was in love! Now it seems cheerful again and is eating like there's no tomorrow, so I guess things are back to normal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! What'll it be?${prompt};
Oh! Your chocobo likes its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time!${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how cute the chick will be!${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo has been passing its time here in the stables without a concern in the world!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made it a bit more patient!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of Windurst. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Oh...oh! Yes, of course, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} enjoyed it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it!${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. Your chocobo really played to the crowds!${prompt};
But it was a little too much sometimes, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Windurst.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Windurst was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
But it got lost sooo many times!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
Windurst compensates you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it!${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} dug for hours, but it hardly found anything!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was great! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't even know its role! It just caused trouble for the other actors.${prompt};

The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}! I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}! What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I can't tell yet whether your chocobo will be a male or a female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};

Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care!${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it!${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you should discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love!${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing!${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all... I guess it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because East Sarutabaruta is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Tahrongi Canyon is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Meriphataud Mountains. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with some gil as thanks for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Windurst, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's this? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any more?${prompt};
What? You want to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you'll never ever see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again! You really don't mind?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Do you have anything you have to say for yourself?${prompt};
I guess if that's what you really want... Custody of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for it?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? This must be hard on you too, huh? Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? Then don't forget it!${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you stick with it through to the end!${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should stick with it to the end!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse!${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Well, all right... Then ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Here, let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I'll be needing from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}!;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hi, ${name-player}!;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / / /G/ /K/P].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].${prompt};
I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!${prompt};
That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Oh dear...;
You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions.;
You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.${prompt};
First, we must test the level of trust between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.${prompt};
I'm sure even ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hides things while you are not around...${prompt};
Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.${prompt};
If you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is completely absorbed in its current activities.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Search for the chocobo's item.;
Watch over the chocobo.${prompt};
You find something in the ground.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} appears to be very happy.${prompt};
Kweh!!!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} noticed what you were doing...${prompt};
You gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, didn't you?${prompt};
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.${prompt};
I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.${prompt};
One of the workers at our stable gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, right?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...${prompt};
At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.${prompt};
Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to want out...${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks happy to see you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't look very happy...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is in high spirits.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks irritated.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping peacefully.${prompt};
You feel a faint warmth in the room left behind by ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Now feeding the chocobo...${prompt};
${number: 1}: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo its food.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} gobbles up the ${item-singular: 3[2]} in a single gulp!${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has found something!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems interested in your story.${prompt};
Which would you like to talk about?;
${selection-lines};
Random chitchat.;
An impatient chocobo.;
A curious chocobo.;
A worrisome chocobo.;
A youthful chocobo.;
A happy chocobo.;
A diligent chocobo.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Gallop”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Canter”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Burrow”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Bore”!${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem to understand your story...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is inspired by your story.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hangs its head in shame.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} awakens from its sleep.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is still fast asleep...${prompt};
Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!${prompt};
W-wow... You're pretty fast!${prompt};
Th-this is absurd...${prompt};
You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!${prompt};
This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...${prompt};
That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!${prompt};
Now have you learned never to underestimate ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}?${prompt};
This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!${prompt};
It's a tie!${prompt};
Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...${prompt};
Hmph. If ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!${prompt};
Luck was simply not with us today...${prompt};
Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?${prompt};
Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} just fine!${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};
Keh!${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} becomes friends with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} here...${prompt};
You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with ${entity: 1}...${prompt};
Good day to you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.${prompt};
I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?${prompt};
Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?${prompt};
What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!${prompt};
We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!${prompt};
Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.${prompt};
Foudeel is working on its intelligence.${prompt};
And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!${prompt};
Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?${prompt};
Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.${prompt};
Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?${prompt};
But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.${prompt};
Hey, I remember you!${prompt};
I'm glad you're taking the time to take ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!${prompt};
Oh, there you are!${prompt};
Glad to see you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out on walks! Keep it up!${prompt};
Well, what a coincidence.${prompt};
I'm glad to see that you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
Well, well!;
Fine meeting you here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I am pleased to see that you are taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!${prompt};
Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!${prompt};
Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!${prompt};

Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?${prompt};
Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.${prompt};
Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.${prompt};
But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!${prompt};
It looked like he wanted me to take him out...${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};

The chocobo chick follows ${name-player}...${prompt};
You look like you have something you want to ask. What do you want?${prompt};
The owner of a lost chick? Hm... This is just a hunch, but...${prompt};

You have my chocobo?${prompt};
My family was opposed to having a chocobo as a pet, so I raised her in secret. But one day, they found her... I...I had to let her go...${prompt};
There must be a way for chocobos and people to live together in peace! Here, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
Red alert!;
My chocobo has gone missing!${prompt};
What's this? You've got him? What a relief! I am supposed to be looking out for any threats to our nation here, but in truth all I have had my eyes out for is that poor little chocobo...${prompt};
You are raising a chocobo as well, are you not? Let me show you my thanks by teaching you a story you can tell your animal...${prompt};
My chocobo is in your care?${prompt};
You have my thanks. I have never seen a more curious bird. He skips off as soon as I avert my eyes!${prompt};
To show you the depth of my gratitude, I will teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
What's that, ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lass]? You say you've got my chocobo?${prompt};
...${wait-36: 2};
Was I raising a chocobo again...?${wait-36: 2};
My stars, that's right! I lost the little bugger when we were out on a walk...${prompt};
Why thank you, dear. Let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
You...you have my chocobo?${prompt};
May Altana's blessings be upon you!;
I was teaching the little one to find his way home when I lost the poor creature.${prompt};
You are raising a chocobo yourself, are you not? In that case, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
What's this?;
You have a parcel for me?${prompt};
Not a parcel, but a chocobo, you say!? Merciful Altana! My chocobo is safe, right? I thought I could take her on a walk between deliveries, but afterwards I accidentally left her with the parcels I delivered!${prompt};
You have my utmost thanks for finding her. Let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
You have my chocobo? I must say, this is a surprise!${prompt};
My chocobo easily becomes lonely... His crying must have kept you awake at night. I am sure I will have to tell him his favorite story several times before he calms down again.${prompt};
As thanks for saving him, let me tell you the story, too...${prompt};
Eh? You have my chocobo, do you?${prompt};
Well done!;
He must have been difficult to please when it comes to feeding. Sorry about that. That little bird just loves Lion Springs' cooking.${prompt};
You are raising a chocobo too, am I correct? Let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...${prompt};
You say you have my chocobo?${prompt};
Although I have always granted my chocobo a measure of independence, I do give her proper care. You must be mistaken.${prompt};
You have my chocobo, you say?${prompt};
That is not a joking matter. I could never stand here so calmly if my chocobo was lost.${prompt};
You say my chocobo is in your care?${prompt};
Sorry, but it is not mine. I laid my chocobo down for a nap just a moment ago.${prompt};
...${wait-36: 2};
Did I lose my chocobo...?${wait-36: 2};
Oh, that's right...I found the little bugger already.;
You must have somebody else's chocobo, ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lass].${prompt};
You say you have my chocobo?${prompt};
My chocobo would never get lost. I trained him to find his way home all by himself!${prompt};
Not a parcel, but a chocobo, you say?;
You must be mistaken. I was with my chocobo mere moments ago.${prompt};
You have my chocobo? I must say, this is a surprise!${prompt};
Especially since my chocobo becomes lonely so easily... He would never leave my side! I am afraid you are mistaken, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].${prompt};
Eh? You say you have my chocobo?${prompt};
That little bird loves the cooking here. He would never leave this place, not for anything. You must be mistaken.${prompt};
Psst! (Wou' ya like me t' le' you in on a lit'le secret? Yer poor choc'bo up an' keeled over last week, bu' the stable 'ands jus' replaced it wi' another one, 'oping tha' ya wou'n't notice!)${prompt};
............;
Ah, I'm jus' pullin' yer leg, ${choice-player-gender}[guv'na/mis'us]! Bu' really, I go' some ripe news for ya.${prompt};
The bobbies down at the VCS thunk up this mighty keen ac'tiv'ty. They calls it the ${color: 5}Choc'bo Ho' an' Cold Game.${color: 1} Sounds like a winner, eh?${prompt};
Listens up, and I'll tell ya all abou' it.${prompt};
Ya see, it seems like ev'ry Richie and his sis'er go' themselfs a choc'bo. While that's all peaches an' kit'ens for the gysahl green grocer, th' extra work load is wreakin' 'avoc on the skirts down at the stables.${prompt};
I even been 'earin' rumors tha' they jus' leave mos' of the birdies tied up in their pens, 'cause they don' 'ave the time t' le' 'em ou'.${prompt};
Some o' the weaker ones can' even walk three steps wit'out fallin' on their bloody bums.${prompt};
Wha' I'm get'in' at is, if we don' do somefin' quick, we'll be up t' our knickers in yellow-feathered invalids!${prompt};
An' that's why the VCS pu' its noggin' t' the cobblestones an' came up wit' this shaggy ho' an' cold game.${prompt};
Alls you 'ave t' do is find the time in yer 'ectic day t' take 'er out for a spin aroun' the commons.${prompt};
An' then, while yer ridin', jus' stop an' dig every now an' again t' find the sparklin' riches we gone an' buried!${prompt};
Yer 'bo gets t' exe'cise, and you get t' line yer pock'ets wit' gelt. Why, that's like knockin' off a couple o' magpies wit' one stone!${prompt};
If no' do it fer yerself, at leas' do it for the poor bird sittin' there starvin' in its lit'le pen, all cold an' alone.${prompt};
Yer 'bo'll thank ya, the stable 'ands'll thank ya, and your dear old mum'll thank ya.${prompt};
The lads at the VCS 'ave been workin' their 'aggies to the bone 'idin' chest after chest 'cross the bloody shires an' mires of Quon an' Mindartia--all for you t' find and pock'et.${prompt};
You'd 'ave t' be nut'ier than a squirrel factory t' pass this fine op'ortunity up!${prompt};
So, wha' do ya say?${prompt};
Are ya goin' t' le' ev'rybo'y down by bein' spoilt cheese, or are ya goin' t' give 'ot an' cold a jimmie?${prompt};
Give it a jimmie?;
${selection-lines};
Aight!;
Slock off!${prompt};
You oughn't use that kin' o' lan'gage 'round a lady, sailor. Bu' I'll le' it go this time.${prompt};
Spo'en like a true seeker of a'ven'ure!${prompt};
'old on a widget... You don' 'ave all three main maps, do ya?${prompt};
Ya know the ones I'm talkin' 'bout--the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}, and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
I'm sorry, love, but I can' 'elp ya out 'til you've got yer grubby grabbers on all three. Come back again when yer 'ooked up, aight?${prompt};
Now, the VCS says I got t' give ya the lowdown on the rules before I se' ya on yer way, so bear wit' me, aight?${prompt};
Wha' ya need to know?;
${selection-lines};
Any ${choice-player-gender}[Jefferson/Jennie] who wants t' participate in the Choc'bo 'ot an' Cold Game will need a special ${color: 5}chocograph${color: 1} auforizin' ${choice-player-gender}['im/'er] t' dig in a cer'ain area.${prompt};
There're all kinds of graphs for all kinds of shinies loca'ed in lots all over Vana'diel.${prompt};
An' the best part is, once ya got one, it's yers 'til yer bluer than a bobbin.${prompt};
An' now ya wan' t' know where ya can get one, eh?${prompt};
Well, no worries, chap, I've go' two right 'ere for ya, free o' charge!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is the it'm you'll need t' star' the game.${prompt};
Jus' drop one on the ground in an area 'scribed on one o' yer chocographs an' turn 'round three times widdershins. In a mat'er of sec'nds, yer noble steed'll be shov'lin' down those greens faster 'an you can say poppycockins! Simple as 'at!${prompt};
Once yer 'bo's finished dinin', yer map'll open and you can check the gen'ral location of the sparkly.${prompt};
Oh, jus' don' forge' tha' you can only use ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} once, and you'll 'ave t' come back t' me if ya wan' another.${prompt};
Ah, the loo'. I can smell it from 'ere...;
Well, first ya ride yer 'bo out to the location marked on yer map.${prompt};
When ya think ya migh' be close, tell yer bird t' dig a spell.${prompt};
When he's done pe'kin' take a goo' lis'en. Chances are 'e'll squawk somefin' righ' dandy.${prompt};
Dependin' on the distance ya're from the riches, the reaction of yer bird'll change.${prompt};
When ya think yer on top of the tipper...${prompt};
...crack yer whip an' get yer 'bo's 'ead bobbin'.${prompt};
Jus' remember tha' some treasure's buried quite deep, so ya may need a 'alf-a-dozen digs t' reach it.${prompt};
But if ya tough it ou', you'll 'ventually come 'cross a lovely chest.${prompt};
Then alls you 'ave t' do is open it an' move the loo' t' yer gobbinbag all proper-like.${prompt};
T' guarantee an 'appy 'ot 'an cold ex'perience, you'll wan' t' know how choc'bo 'bilities can make it easier t' get yer 'ands on the prize.${prompt};
The ones tha'll 'elp you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” an' “Bore.”${prompt};
Burrow an' Bore'll 'llow ya t' go a dolly deeper wit' each dig, helping you reach the chest 'fore yer bird grows all snoozy.${prompt};
Treasure Finder'll 'elp you scrag the treasure easier by polishin' yer 'bo's sense of smellin'.${prompt};
Ah, now this is the mos' im'portan' thing I'll be tellin' ya, so lend me yer ear for a spell, aight?${prompt};
Choc'bos are quite dapper diggers, but all that bobbin' o' the neck does quite a number on their crookid lit'le spines.${prompt};
When yer bo's 'ad enough, 'e'll le' ya know by up an' refusin' t' dig anymore.${prompt};
If this 'appens, it means the fun's over 'til the morrow, mate. 'op off yer bird an' le' 'im rest a while.${prompt};
Ya see, the key t' lolly huntin' is keepin' yer 'bo chipper by reducin' the number times ya make 'im dig.${prompt};
Ya followin' me?${prompt};
Well, tha' was fun, wasn' it?${prompt};
Now I be' yer ready to get star'ed, righ'?${prompt};
'ere are the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} an' the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} I promised.${prompt};
An' 'ere's the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Remember, I can give you another clump when this one's gone.${prompt};
'owever, you'll 'ave t' le' yer lit'le birdie rest a while 'fore I do.${prompt};
An' that's it! Off ya go, poppet!${prompt};
Goo' luck, and god'esspeed, aight?${prompt};
Lords an' ladies, step right up an' play the 'ottest game in the Kingdom--the Choc'bo 'ot an' Cold Game!${prompt};

Greetings. I am a journeyman trainer from the VCS, and I have been sent to this town to promote knowledge exchange between chocobo owners.${prompt};
We believe that the best way to promote interaction between owners is through interaction between chocobos.${prompt};
And after countless VCS conferences, we recently agreed on the establishment of a new program--${prompt};
Kamp Kweh!${prompt};
Breeders need only possess a chocobo to join.;
Please speak with me again if you are interested.${prompt};
I can answer your questions regarding Kamp Kweh?${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
What exactly is Kamp Kweh?;
How do I sign up?;
Are there any restrictions?;
Nothing at all.${prompt};
Kamp Kweh is a place where fellow breeders can bring their chocobos to interact with each other.${prompt};
At the camp, owners can check the status of their companions' animals...${prompt};
...as well as confirm breeding compatibility.${prompt};
However, please note that any results from these tests are merely estimates, and may not fully reflect the actual condition of an animal.${prompt};
Our wish is that through the various camp activities we offer, your chocobo will have the opportunity to improve its skills.${prompt};
Only adventurers who are currently raising a chocobo can participate.${prompt};
Owners can enroll their animals once they have hatched.${prompt};
To begin, adventurers should first form a party of those who wish to participate, and then come talk to me or any of the other VCS journeyman trainers stationed throughout Vana'diel.${prompt};
Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.${prompt};
We refuse admission to the following:${prompt};
1. Any owners who have not checked up on their chocobos recently. Those who feel that they may have been neglecting their animal may want to visit the stables before attempting to participate.${prompt};
2. Chocobos who are sleeping or have run away.${prompt};
3. Chocobos who have yet to be named.${prompt};
4. Party members who are too far away from the stables.${prompt};
We would not think of leading a chocobo away from its pen when the owner was not present.${prompt};
Welcome back. Have you come to enroll in Kamp Kweh?${prompt};
Enroll?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I see. If you wish to participate in the future, feel free to contact me or one of my companions.${prompt};
I am sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], your chocobo is currently unable to participate. Please confirm your chocobo's condition and speak with me again when everything is in order.${prompt};
None of the other members of your party possess chocobos able to participate in camp activities. Please confirm their conditions and speak with me again when everything is in order.${prompt};
None of your party members are close enough to the stables to participate in camp activities. Please speak with me again when everyone has assembled.${prompt};
Now that we have arrived, we can begin.${prompt};
What do you wish to do?;
${selection-lines};
Call your chocobo.;
Let it play with others.;
Check the chocobos' vitals.;
Check mating compatibility.;

Let me start with the Windurst Waters.${prompt};
Let me continue by marking your map of Windurst Walls.${prompt};

I shall begin by marking the important locations on your map of the Ru'Lude Gardens.${prompt};

Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch.;
This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.${prompt};
I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.${prompt};
Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.${prompt};
How about you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]?${prompt};
If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in ${choice: 0}[Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Sign me up!;
Not today.${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}!;
You are now an official member of the CRA's ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
I see.;
Please come back if you ever change your mind!${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Why race chocobos, anyway?;
How do I register for a race?;
How do I prepare for a race?;
What kind of races are there?;
What are “racing teams”?;
Quit.;
Return.${prompt};
Why not!?;
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};
You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt};
Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt};
Join this team?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!${prompt};
Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.${prompt};
Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.${prompt};
What do we have here...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}:${prompt};
Alright, ${name-player}, I will store this in our safe.${prompt};

----------------------------------------;
★Free Run★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: None${prompt};

Here is the information on the next race:${prompt};
★Novice Race I★;
Chocobos: 4;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};

Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.${prompt};
★Novice Race III★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you.;
If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.${prompt};
★Challenge Race I★;

One moment please while entries are confirmed with CRA headquarters.;
Greetings! I've been sent by the VCS to observe the final touches being put on our new racing facilities.${prompt};
In addition, my colleagues and I will spend the next few weeks training for our positions as receptionists, vendors, and announcers.${prompt};
Our grand opening is but a few days away. I hope to see you and all of your companions back for the big event!${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
We have been holding on to the prize from your last race until you had room enough in your gobbiebag to carry it back to your Mog House.${prompt};
Might you be ${name-player}?;
Excellent. VCS headquarters was informed that you would be stopping by our branch, and sent this package containing the prize from your last race.${prompt};
${name-player}, thank you for waiting.${prompt};
Much to the VCS and the CRA's delight, the recent efforts of chocobo breeders across Vana'diel has helped to generate an unprecedented amount of interest in our endeavor.;
More people than ever have begun to express an interest in raising their own chocobo.${prompt};
As a means of expressing our gratitude, we have therefore decided to confer upon the victors of CRA Classics rewards befitting a champion.;
We congratulate you on your impressive achievement, ${name-player}. You are a true inspiration for breeders everywhere!${prompt};
Hello there, ${name-player}.;

Chocobet centers.;
The grandstand.;
Portals.;
Guides.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.${prompt};
It can be found just south of here.${prompt};
The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt};
Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt};
There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt};
All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt};
The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt};
To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt};
The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} will be provided anytime you purchase ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or sign up for a race.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.${prompt};
This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt};
As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt};
For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished.;
Your cooperation is appreciated.${prompt};
Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.${prompt};
They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.${prompt};
This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Racing teams.;
Race rules.;
Race types.;
Victory points.;
Race Progression.;
That's about it.${prompt};
A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt};
Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt};
In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt};
For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt};
The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt};
What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt};
Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt};
The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt};
The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt};
The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt};
In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt};
Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt};
Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt};
For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt};
We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt};
No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt};
Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt};
As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt};
Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt};
Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt};
The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt};
As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt};
Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt};
Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt};
Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt};
Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt};
What would you like to hear more about?;
${selection-lines};
Race preparations.;
Signup procedure.;
Collecting winnings.;
Signing up for another race.;
I'm fine, thanks.${prompt};
There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt};
First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt};
Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt};
Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt};
All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt};
A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt};
Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt};
There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt};
There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt};
Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt};
In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt};
The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt};
You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt};
To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt};
The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt};
You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt};
After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt};
This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt};
We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt};
What would you like to ask?;
${selection-lines};
What is chocobetting?;
How do I bet?;
What are odds?;
When do I bet?;
How do I collect winnings?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt};
To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt};
Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};
And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt};
Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};
The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt};
To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt};
For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt};
We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt};
Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt};
Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt};
It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt};
What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt};
Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt};
The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt};
Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt};
Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt};
Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt};
Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt};
Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt};
Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt};

Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch.;
This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.${prompt};
I am truly sorry ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here.;
This service area only caters to ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.${prompt};

With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt};
As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt};
“The Monster Races”!${prompt};
Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt};
Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.;
What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};
The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.;
It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt};
Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.;
If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;
Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.;
Thank you for your understanding.${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt};
We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.;
The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt};
Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.;
And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt};
As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.;
It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.;
Consider yourself warned.${prompt};
In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.;
Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.;
It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt};
Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.;
These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt};

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.${prompt};
Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...${prompt};
...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt};
Good day, fol--${prompt};
ピヨ！${prompt};
Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt};
Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt};
First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt};
ピヨピヨ！${prompt};
She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt};
She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt};
She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt};
She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt};
She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt};
She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt};
She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt};
She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt};
Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt};
Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt};
Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt};
Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt};
ピヨ～♪${prompt};
Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt};
The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt};
She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt};
She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt};
She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt};
And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt};
And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt};
The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt};
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.;
And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...;
...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!;
Good day, fol--;
ピヨ！;
Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.;
And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!;
#${number: 4}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]};
#${number: 5}: ${chocobo-name: 1[2]};
#${number: 6}: ${chocobo-name: 2[2]};
#${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]};
And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!;
Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!;
I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt};
Yeah...;
Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt};
And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt};
Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt};
They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt};
Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt};
As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt};
${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt};
Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt};
Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt};
And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt};
ピヨッ！${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt};
a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt};
This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt};
Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt};
We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt};
Well, there you have it.${prompt};
Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen!;
President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt};
...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt};
Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt};
Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt};
Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt};
The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt};
Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt};
So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt};
Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt};
Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt};
My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt};
We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt};
Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt};
Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt};
What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt};
Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt};
Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt};
Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt};
Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt};
Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt};
And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt};
Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt};
Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt};
Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt};
The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt};
When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt};
When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Markovich, what did you think of the start?;
Well, I fel--;
ピヨピヨッ！;
Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.;
Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
And as they pass the halfway mark...;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!;
${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!;
While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!;
Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!;
And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!;
ピヨピヨ！;
Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed is approaching dangerous limits!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed has begun to drop off!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!;
The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!;
The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!;
The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!;
And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
And now they're approaching the final corner!;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!;
The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!;
What's this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
And it's ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!;
Let's take a look at the results...${prompt};
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt};
There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt};
Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt};
Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt};
Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt};
What an amazing race!;
The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt};
What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt};
The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt};
Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt};
Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt};
Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt};
The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt};
And there you have it.;
This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt};
And now, let's see the results from the last race.;
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1});
And that's all she wrote, folks!;
The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!;
Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?;
She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!;
She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.;
Until next time, race fans...;
Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt};
Taking the crown for today's race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
To the winning steed's owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt};
And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt};
Excellent race, ${name-player}!;
You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt};
Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt};
Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt};
But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt};

With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};
Oh...?;
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};
Is that so...?;
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};
But that's not where it ends!;
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;
But...${prompt};
But...?${prompt};
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};
I see...;
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};
But enough talking, I say.;
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};
Oh, yes, right...;
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};
Whoopee!;
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};
Erm...yes...;
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};
My, oh my...!;
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};
A-ahem!;
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;
<Sniffle>${prompt};
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Hrmmm...;
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};
And won't you look at the lineup!;
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};
Huh?;
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};
<Gulp>;
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};
Um...Professor Shantotto...;
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};
Ohohohohoho!;
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};
H-hey!;
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};
And you, Goccilo!;
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;
Until next time...!${prompt};
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};
What's with the baffled expression?;
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
But something seems to be different...;
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};
And that completes the lineup, folks.;
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};
But no more...;
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};
Well I'll be...;
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;
Congratulations!${prompt};
Great race, ${name-player}.;
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};
Princess...;
Princess Sakura!${prompt};
Princess...?;
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};
Searching for...me?${prompt};
Yes, Your Highness.;
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};
Are you serious!?;
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};
That is correct.;
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};
...!;
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};
Wh...what happened?${prompt};
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};
So that's what happened...${prompt};
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};
Your Highness!;
But...why!?${prompt};
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};
What's more...${prompt};
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};
What...?${prompt};
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;
I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt};
I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt};
Heehee!;
Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt};
${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!;
Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt};
You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt};
What?;
How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt};
Hohoho...;
It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt};
I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt};
Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?;
No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt};
Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt};
<Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.;
But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt};
You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.;
To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt};
And you, our new Chocochampion!;
Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt};
Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.;
These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Hrmmm!;
${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!;
Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?;
All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.;
But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.;
Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!;
And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!;
The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
What's this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt};
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!;
Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!;
And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!;
I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step.;
And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!;
And here's some unexpected drama, folks!;
The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?;
Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!;
Uh-oh, what's going on here!?;
The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!;
Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!;
What's this!?;
All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!;
Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!;
That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!;
Never in all my days, race fans!;
In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!;
How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?;
In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!;
Shantotto starts casting Tornado!;
The speed of the chocobos has dropped!;
The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!;
The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!;
Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?;
What in the world do you think you're doing!?;
Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.;
This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.;
What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?;
I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.;
This could get heavy, folks!;
All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.;
Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?;
It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!;
There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!;
More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!;
And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!;
The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.;
This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!;
This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.;
Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!;
And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!;
Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!;
And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!;
But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?;
I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!;
Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?;
It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!;
The time for a final spurt is now or never!;
And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?;
What would you like to do?;

Someone has dropped the die!${prompt};
Read which chapter?;
${selection-lines};
1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”;
2. “Rules of the Roll.”;
3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt};
Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt};
Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt};
In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt};
If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt};
Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt};
Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt};
If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt};
Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
Perchance you have come to question the authenticity of my testimony regarding the Sentinels. I do not deny that I may have possibly added a bit of color to the facts surrounding the true nature of our fine leader, but all's well that ends well, no?${prompt};
Ah, yet you need not fret any longer, my fine friend. Our prodigal president and provider once again has proffered forth her ever-giving hands in a selfless gesture of heartwarming charity.${prompt};
From this day forth, all employees of Salaheem's Sentinels can now teleport freely from San d'Oria to Aht Urhgan Whitegate!${prompt};
And by freely, I mean in the sense of “free as a bird” as I will require a fee of ${number: 0} gil from those who wish to partake in my services.${prompt};
Thank you very much, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].${prompt};
Now let us be on our merry way!;
Visit the Chocobo Circuit?;
${selection-lines};
Off to the races!;
Not right now.${prompt};
The door is locked...${prompt};
It's here! It's here!;
The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt};
If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt};
Where would you like to go?;
${selection-lines};
Nowhere.;
San d'Oria.;
Bastok.;
Windurst.${prompt};
See you again, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt};
Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt};
Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?;
${selection-lines};
Sure!;
Doing what?;
Not today.${prompt};
A thousand thanks, kupo!;
Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt};
Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!;
Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt};
You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt};
Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt};
It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt};
And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt};
However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt};
And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt};
By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt};
One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt};
We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt};
Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt};
...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt};
The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt};
So, what do you say, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
I'm in.;
Maybe later.${prompt};
Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt};
Kupopo...${prompt};
Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt};
My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?${prompt};
Amazing! You've already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt};
Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt};
Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those ${choice: 0}[San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!${prompt};
Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt};
Where would like to go, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Nowhere.;
San d'Oria.;
Bastok.;
Windurst.${prompt};
Happy travels, kupo!${prompt};
Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!${prompt};
Oooh! It's ${name-player}!;
Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!${prompt};
Set this area's A flag to:;
${selection-lines};
Nowhere.;
San d'Oria.;
Bastok.;
Windurst.${prompt};
Switch on this area's B flag?;
${selection-lines};
No (OFF).;
Yes (ON).${prompt};
Flag settings complete.;
The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!${prompt};
And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!${prompt};
But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo...;
There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...${prompt};
Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!${prompt};
I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom.;
All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt};
The recipient for this present was supposed to be ${choice: 8}[level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].${prompt};
And I'm pretty sure we were looking for ${choice: 9}[a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].${prompt};
Someone who was trained as ${choice: 10}[a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...${prompt};
If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.${prompt};
Give up for now?;
${selection-lines};
That would be best.;
Not just yet!${prompt};
Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo.;
But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!${prompt};
Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.${prompt};
Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo.;
But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...${prompt};
Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!${prompt};
Presents can be claimed using a card just like this!;
Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!${prompt};
Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!${prompt};
Hand this card to your friend.;
It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!${prompt};
Your help was invaluable!;
Here, this is for you, kupo!${prompt};
There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo!;
Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!${prompt};
I'm so glad we found you!;
Here's your present, kupo!${prompt};
What are you trying to pull, kupo!?;
Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!${prompt};
One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!${prompt};
Hey! You there! Adventurer! Have you ever happened to see a sandworm? You know, gigantic worm, segmented body, lives in the sand?${prompt};
Well...hmmm... Oh! Then how about a ladybug? They're distinctive little pests with bright red, semicircular bodies, three distinctive black spots and...${prompt};
I apologize, I've gone and totally forgotten my manners! You must excuse me.;
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Atelloune, assistant to renowned biologist Professor Clauvert B Chanoix.${prompt};
To help with the professor's research, I'm searching for all kinds of specimens from Quon and Mindartia whose numbers have been dwindling in recent years.${prompt};
I just thought that an adventurer such as yourself had surely seen some rare creatures on your travels...but never mind. I'm sorry for disturbing you.${prompt};
Greetings, adventurer. San d'Oria is grateful for your services. I am Royal Squire Esmallegue.${prompt};
Grand Knight Depardal has left his post as sentry in the Outlands. For now he has been enlisted as a member of the city's defense force.${prompt};
As I'm sure you are already aware, San d'Oria's military is divided into two branches, the Royal Knights and the Temple Knights.${prompt};
In times of peace, we Royal Knights are charged with the defense of the nation, while the Temple Knights are responsible for maintaining the public order. However, in times of war the Temple Knights are given the role of supervising our ranks.${prompt};
Unfortunately, this is a source of some conflict. Despite being united under one kingdom, there is strong sense of rivalry between the two armies. It has been said that during the Great War there were many areas of contention between us.${prompt};
Hello, there. Say, if you have some time would you mind lending me an ear? I've got a bit of a problem...${prompt};
Well, I'm not sure if you already knew or not, but I'm Atelloune, assistant to the great zoologist, Professor Clavauert B Chanoix.${prompt};
I get a lot of mail in my line of work. You know, letters from people of all ages who are passionate about animals, asking me all sorts of questions.${prompt};
I recently came across a letter whose squiggly handwriting caught my eye.${prompt};
It was sent by a young Elvaan boy who didn't give his name.${prompt};
“Dear Atelloune, my grandpa says that when he was my age there were big, red, round bugs in Ronfaure.${prompt};
“But I think he's going senile, and is just thinking of an apple. Either that or a liar, and there were never any bugs like that. Please tell him he's crazy.”${prompt};
...Hmmm.${prompt};
I really am sorry to bother you with this.${prompt};
It's just that this kid really struck a nerve with me. I mean, there isn't even a question! So irritating...${prompt};
I'm thinking that what he is referring to may be the ladybug.;
It was a species of vermin which inhabited the Ronfaure region before the war.${prompt};
You know, when I was just a little girl I mistook them for app--${prompt};
Never mind that!${prompt};
Let's focus on the real problem here. The ladybug supposedly went extinct a long time ago.${prompt};
But here's where it gets really interesting!${prompt};
I believe that there must still be some ladybugs out there somewhere in Vana'diel! If you ever happen to see one in your travels, please try and bring me back a live specimen!${prompt};
Wait...that's going to be tough. They're actually quite large animals. And I wouldn't want to harm them... Well, if you ever chance upon the corpse of one do you think you could bring back the ${item-plural: 0[2]} for me? You'll know them when you see them. That's all I need.${prompt};
I'd reeeally like to blow this brat's mind. And I think that would do just the trick.${prompt};
Oh my! Is this really ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!?${prompt};
Wow, it's even more beautiful than I imagined. Such brilliance! And this contrast between the red and black... Absolutely remarkable!${prompt};
Where did you find this!?${prompt};
Ahhh, playing your cards tight to the vest, eh? That's fine, suit yourself.${prompt};
It doesn't matter. This is exactly what I need to make a believer out of that little Elvaan brat. Maybe now he'll recognize the true beauty of the ladybug!${prompt};
To think of that poor grandfather, being called a liar by his own grandchild! Well, this should help him sleep at night.${prompt};
I must say, it's all thanks to you. I'll tell you what. In return, I'll let you in on a little secret...${prompt};
The real reason why the ladybugs went extinct...${prompt};
To be honest, not even the most esteemed minds in the ecological field could explain why it happened.;
But I've come across some...other information.${prompt};
Rumor has it that right around the time of the Great War the ladybugs were overhunted to extinction by an inconsiderate people with no regard for the natural balance.${prompt};
"They were described as seemingly possessed, an eerie and ominous group. Obsessed with the red and black colors of the ladybug, which they could constantly be heard murmuring, as if in a trance. ""Red...black...""${prompt}";
There's no doubt in my mind that these wings were in high demand for some reason or another back then.${prompt};
For example, perhaps some military strategists thought up an application for this characteristic design which so effectively startles predators.${prompt};
The possibilities are endless!${prompt};
...${prompt};
What? Why are you looking at me like that?${prompt};
Don't misunderstand. I'll see to it that these wings make their way to that little Elvaan boy...just as soon as I run some tests of my own!${prompt};
Here, now take this and be on your way. And no dropping in unannounced! I have work to do...${prompt};
Welcome to the Lion Springs!${prompt};
You wish my permission to dance on the stage?${prompt};
Why, I have not had dancers here since Troupe Brilioth graced us with a performance.${prompt};
As I recall, my customers were riotously appreciative...;
Their cheers shook the very walls of the tavern.${prompt};
Are you sure you're a dancer?;
It is just that you seem so...nervous.${prompt};
Well, I suppose even professionals have the jitters every now and again.;
Allow me to prepare the audience...${prompt};
Now's your chance to capture the hearts of the audience.${prompt};
What do you do?;
${selection-lines};
Appeal to the audience.;
Stretch out your hand.;
Strike a pose.${prompt};
Is that what they call dancing these days?;
Should we call for a doctor? I think ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] having a fit.;
My eyes...;
Your dancing style is...quite unique.${prompt};
You know, I'm not sure my establishment is the right place for such an “original” performance...${prompt};
Your dancing style was...quite unique...${prompt};
You there, adventurer!;
I wonder have you heard of the so-called “Cavernous Maws”?;
That is what many are calling the strange stone effigies appearing throughout Vana'diel.${prompt};
I don't know if it's true or not, but some say that it was the wicked rituals of Orcish mesmerizers on the stones that caused them to assume that wretched form.${prompt};
The San d'Oria residential area is ahead. You'll find your Mog House within.${prompt};
Ahead lies the residential area. Proceed to your Rent-a-Room, foreigner!${prompt};
Mog Houses are useful places. You can recover your HP and MP, and store items.${prompt};
You can also change jobs there.;
All adventurers of San d'Orian citizenship are assigned a Mog House.${prompt};
Make yourself at home!${prompt};
Hmm... So be it.${prompt};
Is there something I can help you with?${prompt};

You see, when I was justaru a little girl, I did something awful to my father.${prompt};
Kipopo, I know you have Daddy's bag.${prompt};
Daddy spent a lot of time making it for an importantaru person, so please be a good girl and give it back.${prompt};
There's nothing to give back.;
Tek's ripped it to shreds.${prompt};
Ding-dong! The bag is dead!♪;
Which old bag? The new handbag!♪${prompt};
Wh-wh-what!?${prompt};
I thoughtaru you were making the bag for Kipopo!${prompt};
I...I'm sorry...${prompt};
Who's this importantaru person anyway?${prompt};
Isn't Kipopo your importantaru person?${prompt};
Have you already forgotten about Mommy?${prompt};
N-no, of course not...;
It's just that I thought it was high timey-wime you had a new--${prompt};
I won't forgive you if you betray Mommy!${prompt};
Only Kipopo can be your importantaru person!${prompt};
Father poured his heart into crafting that handbag for someone he dearly-wearly cared for--a person who was his ray of hope amidst that terrible war.${prompt};
Despite always being swamped with work, Father would never neglectaru to take care of me and was forever trying to fill the gap that Mother left when she passed away.${prompt};
My happiness was his priority--deep in my hearty-weart I knew that and wanted so to alleviate his burden. But, I was only a child, and a petulantaru one at that...${prompt};
Hey, how about if you repairrr that handbag?;
Ah, Tek!${prompt};
You know what...that's a grand suggestion. Not that I'll be able to makey-wake amends for something twenty years pastaru, but my conscience is appealing for me to repair it.${prompt};
Have Kipopo repair the handbag?;
${selection-lines};
No thanks.;
That'd be greataru!${prompt};
Hey now, therrre's no need to be shy.${prompt};
Then it's decided!;
I really-weally appreciate you giving me the chance.${prompt};
Now, I'll need some materials to restore the handbag to its original state. Could you findy-wind me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}?${prompt};
Hey, thanks for bringing me these!${prompt};
I'll be needing the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, too, of course.${prompt};
I'm up to my ears in work rightaru now, but I'll get started on the repairs as soon as possible.${prompt};
Hey, welcome back. Greataru news--everything went smoothly and the repairs are now complete!${prompt};
I took the liberty of making it identical to the one Father craftarued all those years ago. I hopey-wope you don't mind.${prompt};
But the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that you firstaru brought in... I still can't shake their uncanny-wanny resemblance to Father's from my head. It's just a coincidence, right?${prompt};
Ah, the handbag's made a full rrrecovery, I see!;
Heh, that's strrrange...;
I'm not surrre what's come over me, but suddenly I've got this inexplicable urge to barrre my claws and--${prompt};
N-no, Tek, no repeatarus...please!${prompt};
Nyahaha, I was just kidding!;
A little...${prompt};
Yikes!;
Hurry, take that handbag someplace safey-wafe before Tek loses control!${prompt};
How are you liking the handbag? Just make sure Tek doesn't getaru her claws on it...I can't guarantee I'll be able to fix it again if she does!${prompt};
Hm? That ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have there...${prompt};
It's exactaruly the same as the one my father used to have!${prompt};
Father used to be a craftsman at the Tanners' Guild, you see. He's long retired now, though.${prompt};
The Tanners' Guild in Windurst where he worked suffered irreparable damage during the Crystal War.${prompt};
Father wanted nothing more than to restore the guild. But the scars of war run deepy-weep, and Father couldn't preventaru the guild from being officially shut down by the disheartened guildmaster.${prompt};
I'm following in my father's footsteppy-weps and apprenticing here alongside my sister, Tek--it's a long story--over there.${prompt};
Our mission is to fulfill Father's dreamy-weam of rebuilding the guild in Windurst.${prompt};
Kipopo!;
You have a quota to fulfill, have you not? You may socialize all you wish--after your duties are done!${prompt};
Well, another day, another step closer to realizing my dreams!${prompt};
You will find a guardswoman named Alaune at the Westgate, south west from here. She has further information that should prove useful in your adventuring.${prompt};
Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.${prompt};
Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.${prompt};
Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.${prompt};
My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel.;
I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy.;
With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.${prompt};
Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.${prompt};
This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well.;
Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.${prompt};
So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?;
Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt};
Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};
Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};
Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};
Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt};
As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.;
There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt};
Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.;
For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt};
Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...;
Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”;
This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt};
Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.;
Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt};
For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.;
Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.;
Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt};
One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.;
Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt};
Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...;
Are you with me so far?${prompt};
So far so good?;
${selection-lines};
Explain Signet again.;
Explain meals again.;
This is a breeze.${prompt};
Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.;
Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};
After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.;
Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt};
Check out the full belly on you! Well done!;
Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.;
This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt};
Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!;
No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt};
Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt};
Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.;
This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt};
Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt};
And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt};
It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt};
Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt};
When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt};
“Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.;
“Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt};
“Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.;
And on, and on, and on...${prompt};
Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.;
This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt};
The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5;
So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt};
Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?;
Very good!${prompt};
I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.;
Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt};
These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.;
It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt};
Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt};
If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.;
They may pay dividends later on...${prompt};
Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.;
They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.;
These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt};
For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt};
But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.;
Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.;
All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt};
You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.;
Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt};
The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt};
The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt};
My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.;
One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt};
Are you still with me?;
${selection-lines};
Explain synthesis again.;
Explain the auction house again.;
Sure am.${prompt};
Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt};
You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.;
Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt};
So, you were able to locate the auction house!;
Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt};
What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.;
It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt};
And now down to brass tacks!;
Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt};
There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt};
For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt};
These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt};
There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.;
The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt};
Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.;
You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt};
As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.;
With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt};
Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.;
And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.;
I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt};
With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.;
Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt};
Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!;
Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt};
A bit of bad news now, though.;
Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt};
As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.;
You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt};
However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt};
Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.;
It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”;
Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt};
Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.;
In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt};
That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt};
All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”;
There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.;
It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt};
It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.;
Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt};
${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt};
You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.;
It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt};
Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.;
Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt};
Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.;
If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt};
I know those smells...;
You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt};
If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt};
Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt};
If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt};
Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!;
You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt};
Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt};
I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.;
I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt};
Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.;
You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt};
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.;
Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};
By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt};
But don't go getting too cocky!;
This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt};
Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.;
I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt};
For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt};
Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.;
You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt};
There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.;
Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt};
And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.;
The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt};
Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt};
I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt};
Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt};
There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”;
Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt};
Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt};
Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.;
And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt};
This shall be your final assignment.;
Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt};
Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.;
Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt};
And now for some information regarding this little beauty.;
As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt};
I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt};
Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.;
Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt};
Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!;
You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt};
And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.;
From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt};
Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt};
Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.;
It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt};
I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.;
It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt};
There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.;
Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.;
I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt};
Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.;
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};
Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.;
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};
Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..;
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};
What will you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing just now.;
Search comments.;
Skillchains.;
Magic bursts.;
Skillchains and elements.${prompt};
Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt};
There are several different categories of search comments.;
These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt};
Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt};
For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt};
Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt};
Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.;
You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt};
Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt};
The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt};
To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt};
Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt};
In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.;
Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt};
Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt};
One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.;
It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt};
The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.;
It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt};
Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.;
You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt};
Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt};
To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt};
In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt};
As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt};
The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt};
For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt};
Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):;
Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),;
Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),;
Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).${prompt};
Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements):;
Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder),;
Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).${prompt};
Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements):;
Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder),;
Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).${prompt};
Amaura!${prompt};
Well, well, if it isn't little Lilisette!${prompt};
It's lovely to see you again, Amaura. You're looking well.${prompt};
Oh, my, just look at ye! How ye've grown!;
Why, the last time I saw ye would've been the day Sir Ragelise passed away...${prompt};
Yes...${prompt};
And what's the pretty little number ye've got on there, eh? Looks mighty familiar, like somethin' your mother used to wear.${prompt};
You like it? It's the performance outfit for my dance troupe. I'm actually a famous dancer now, you know.${prompt};
A dance troupe, ye say? Do those things still even exist? The closest thing we have comin' to San d'Oria nowadays is that Valeriano crew, what with their fire breathin' and sword jugglin' and--${prompt};
Um, yes, we're rather rare nowadays...;
But, more importantly, I have a favor to ask, Amaura. I need you to make that medicine again.${prompt};
Medicine, ye say? You mean the same one I brewed for your father all those years ago?${prompt};
Yes. You see, someone I know is experiencing similar symptoms...${prompt};
Is that right...?;
It breaks my heart to have to disappoint ye, dearie, but I can't make that medicine anymore.${prompt};
Wh-what? But, why?${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
The main ingredient, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, can no longer be found.${prompt};
Oh...${prompt};
A real shame, I know, but it's been that way for some years, ever since the last batch of ${item-plural: 0[2]} was harvested.${prompt};
There's nary a mature tree to be seen nowadays. It's like they all just up and disappeared off the horizon.${prompt};
And to think that not a decade ago, the saplings from which the bulbs could be obtained were still as common as those pesky little hares out in Ronfaure...${prompt};
Saplings...in the past...!${prompt};
${name-player}, I trust I needn't tell you what our next course of action is.${prompt};
Even extinction is no match for this tag-team duo! Whatever the task, and no matter the odds, Future Fabulous shall prevail!;
Heheheheheh...${prompt};
My, my, be that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ye have there?${prompt};
Why, I haven't seen one of these for...;
Actually, I can't remember when I last saw one. How did ye come by it?${prompt};
This is what you said you wanted, right? Please, Amaura, I need the medicine as soon as--${prompt};
Ohoho, ever the impatient young Lilisette, I see. Ye never were one for waiting.${prompt};
I hate to have to disappoint ye again, dearie, but the mature tree is what we need.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
Try planting that bulb by the shore of an unspoilt lake.${prompt};
Once it has grown to maturity, ye'll find resin seeping out from the crack of ripened fruit. That resin, solidified, is what is needed to make our medicine.${prompt};
Alright... I'll do as you say...${prompt};
Yes, yes, that's the spirit. Ye'll have something to look forward to ten, perhaps twenty, years from now.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
Ohoho, it seems I've developed a knack for disappointing ye!${prompt};
Grrr...${prompt};
Like I said: Whatever the task, and no matter the odds!${prompt};
We'll plant this bulb and have it grow into a hulking tree in the blink of an eye...with moss and all!${prompt};
Now, we just need to find an unspoilt lake...${prompt};
${name-player}, do you know of such a place? I must confess, my geographic knowledge is sorely wanting.${prompt};
You, on the other hand, seem to be quite well-traveled and familiar with the lay of the land.${prompt};
Hehe, this is what this tag-team duo is all about--making up for each other's shortcomings!;
Alright then, after you, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/miss] geography expert!${prompt};
Amaura! We have it!${prompt};
Eh? What's the ruckus? Is the house on fire?${prompt};
G-good Goddess...${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Well, pinch my cheeks and call me senile...;
What miraculous manner of magic did ye use to get a hold of this?${prompt};
Heehee, that's a trade secret. Now please, Amaura, make me the medicine!${prompt};
Very well then, I'll get started.;
But, just so ye know, this isn't some quack's instant synthesis recipe. Don't forget to breathe from time to time while ye wait!${prompt};
Ye're Lilisette's friend, aren't ye? That little ball of energy never could sit still for long...${prompt};
The medicine will be a while yet. How about doin' some household chores for old Amaura in the meantime?${prompt};
Ah, young ones, the medicine's ready.${prompt};
I sincerely hope it serves its purpose.${prompt};
Thank you so much, Amaura.${prompt};
...Lilisette.;
I recall havin' told ye in the past, but this medicine possesses no healing powers. None whatsoever.${prompt};
While it can alleviate the more severe symptoms, and relieve pain by way of dulling the senses, the effects are temporary at best. Ye understand that, don't ye?${prompt};
Yes, Amaura, I understand...${prompt};
Ye're the last person who needs any remindin', but no medicine of any kind was able to save your father...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Come, ${name-player}, we have a delivery to make.${prompt};
Ohoho, it delights me so to see the beautiful young woman Lilisette's become.${prompt};
Quite a far cry from the snot-nosed crybaby who used to come runnin' to me, eyes all red, whenever the other children teased her.${prompt};
I can only imagine the solitude she must have felt, growin' up bereft of her parents.${prompt};
But...${prompt};
I'm relieved to see that she's no longer alone.${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!${prompt};
We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.${prompt};
Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!${prompt};
Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!${prompt};
Ah, you've brought ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! Here, this is for you!${prompt};
Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!${prompt};
If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.${prompt};
Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!${prompt};
How many tokens will you exchange?;
${selection-lines};
The whole kaboodle!;
I'm a miser. Just the one, please.${prompt};
That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who dared!${prompt};
Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!;
As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.${prompt};
For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record!;
But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.${prompt};
We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
Sign me up!;
I'm a little busy, sorry.${prompt};
We understand...;
But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!${prompt};
You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo!;
Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.${prompt};
The recipients are Ullasa, Femitte, Chanpau, and Balasiel. Four people in total, kupo.${prompt};
Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.${prompt};
Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.${prompt};
And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?${prompt};
Happy delivering, kupo!${prompt};
We want you to deliver the presents to Ullasa, Femitte, Chanpau, and Balasiel. Four people in total, kupo.${prompt};
You've yet to deliver presents to ${choice: 1}[Ullasa,/Femitte,/Chanpau,/Balasiel,] ${choice: 2}[Ullasa,/Femitte,/Chanpau,/Balasiel,] and ${choice: 3}[Ullasa,/Femitte,/Chanpau,/Balasiel,] kupo.${prompt};

Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!${prompt};
Here's a little something for your kindness.${prompt};
You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?${prompt};
A Starlight Celebration present? For me?;
How very kind of you! And such fine craftsmanship, too!${prompt};
What is this that you bring? A Starlight Celebration present!;
You have my thanks, adventurer. It warms the heart to see the people of all nations coming together in the spirit of giving.${prompt};
Well, looky here, if it isn't a Starlight Celebration present! And for me, of all people!;
You sure know how to bring a smile to a jobless Elvaan's face!${prompt};
A present for me? But, whatever for--aaah, the Starlight Celebration!;
To think that someone remembers this frail old man...<sniff>...${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!;
As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.${prompt};
We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
But of course!;
I help no one but myself.${prompt};
You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo!;
Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.${prompt};
If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.${prompt};
Let' see... This addressee of this card is a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.${prompt};
Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.${prompt};
Ah, you've brought us a card!;
Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.${prompt};
We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!${prompt};
Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.${prompt};

Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me.;
I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.${prompt};
I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline.;
To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks.;
He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.${prompt};
May I be of service?;
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
Learn recipes.;
Check fewell.;
Replenish fewell.;
Purchase materials.;
Receive training.;
Trade cinder.;
Get information.${prompt};
Recipes, you say?;
Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...${prompt};
...I'm sorry.;
I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.${prompt};
I've got it! How about ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...${prompt};

That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?${prompt};
But of course!;
If you'll just allow me to inspect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a moment...${prompt};
Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows:;
Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.${prompt};
Replenish fewell?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say?;
Then you've come to the right place!${prompt};
...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting.;
Come back again if you need a refill.${prompt};
Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for ${number: 0} gil.;
How does that sound?${prompt};
Pay ${number: 0} gil?;
${selection-lines};
Deal!;
No thanks.${prompt};
Understood.;
Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.${prompt};
I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend.;
Perhaps another time.${prompt};
Excellent!;
Now we just pop open your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} here, and...${prompt};
There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell!;
Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been filled to capacity!;
You hand the synergy engineer ${number: 0} gil.;
How do you expect me to do that when your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is sitting inside a furnace, friend?;
You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.${prompt};
Materials, you say? But of course!;
Have a look at our selection.${prompt};
Purchase something?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
For ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, that comes to ${number: 2} gil.${prompt};
Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] technique.;
Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.${prompt};
...But I'm afraid you'll need ${choice: 0}[/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.${prompt};
And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training.;
So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?${prompt};
Train in which technique?;
${selection-lines};
Cancel.;
You wish to improve your ${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique.;
Is this correct?${prompt};
It would seem your ${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.${prompt};
Train in this technique?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very well!;
Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...${prompt};
...See, you take this part here, and...;
Yes, yes...just like that...${prompt};
...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week!;
Phew, that was a close one...${prompt};
...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...${prompt};
<Clink, clank...clunk>;
...Er, let's try that once more...${prompt};
...Superb! A quick learner, I see.;
If only all my students were as attentive as you!${prompt};
Your ${choice: 0}${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level ${number: 1}!;
Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field.;
Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
This is what you want, correct?${prompt};
Make the exchange?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.${prompt};
Excellent! And this is yours.;

Synergy furnaces.;

Synergy techniques.;
Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;
Let's see here...${prompt};
A ${item-singular: 2[2]}-shaped aperture, to be exact...${prompt};
...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity:;
...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities:;

That is all.;
Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt};
...Alas.;
It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt};
Hmm, what's this?;
It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt};

Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!;
What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt};
Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!;
Ain't synergy grand?${prompt};
Wait! No, don't tell me.;
You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt};
Learn about synergy?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
Teach me!;
Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.;
Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt};
I thought you'd never ask!;
Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt};
Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt};
What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
What in the world...?${prompt};
Our future...is fading away?;
Th-the comet...${prompt};
Are we the only ones...who can see it?${prompt};
The situation is worse than I feared. We haven't any time to waste.;
As for who we could speak to...${prompt};
How about Monarlais Halver, whom we accompanied to entreat the aid of Bastok and Windurst in the past?;
Considering his post, he should be well versed in all things regarding the Crystal War.${prompt};
Whether or not he remembers the two of us, though, we'll just have to find out.${prompt};
What's that? You wish to hear of my father?;
Forgive me, but I'm far too busy to indulge in idle reminiscing.${prompt};
Perhaps you can seek out my son Ailbeche.;
The boy was quite close to his grandfather.${prompt};
Why, those ${item-singular: 0[2]}...!${prompt};
They bear a remarkable resemblance to a prized possession of my dear departed father's.;
Oh, the memories this brings back!${prompt};
Father was quite the ardent angler, you see.;
In fact, I cannot recall a single day that he did not make the trip to Lake Mechieume.${prompt};
Oh, of course he'd spare an hour here or there to instruct me in swordplay.;
A gesture for which I was most thankful, to be sure.${prompt};
But this was but a diversion for him.;
That angling was his true passion was clear for all to see.${prompt};
So all-consuming was his obsession that I grew to resent him.;
What kind of father could harbor a greater love for fishing than for his own family?${prompt};
As it turns out, I had misjudged the man.${prompt};
I heard the truth from my mother one day.;
Fishing as a craft was of little interest to him, she said.${prompt};
And yet, it was an age of war, with foodstuffs few and far between.${prompt};
This is what drove my father to make the perilous journey through Jugner Forest each and every dawn.;
A desire to provide sustenance, not just to his own beloved family, but to his suffering countrymen as well.${prompt};
The father I had seen as little but a cruel taskmaster was, in fact, a deeply honorable, self-sacrificing soul.${prompt};
I was instilled with a newfound pride, and swore that one day I would instill my son with the same values that my father had stood for.${prompt};
In the end, all that he inherited from his grandfather was his skill with the rod and lure.${prompt};
My apologies. Whatever has gotten into me, to get so caught up in trivial nostalgia?${prompt};
At any rate, I wish you the best in your travels.;
Farewell!${prompt};
Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.${prompt};
Those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused.;
Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.${prompt};
Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?${prompt};
I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.${prompt};
What will you do?;

${selection-lines};

Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.;
Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt};
By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt};
At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt};
That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt};
From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt};
But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt};
The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.;
As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt};
We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt};
Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.;
For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt};
Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt};
Examine which stratum abyssite?;
${selection-lines};
None right now.;
Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.${prompt};
The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.${prompt};
Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution!;
Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!${prompt};
Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution.;
It appears there's still room for growth, however.${prompt};
Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted.;
Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?${prompt};
Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.;
Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?${prompt};
How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before.;
Wherever did you find it?${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has evolved into ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Supply me with the ${number: 0} cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.${prompt};

I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the ${choice: 0}[Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana].;
My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.${prompt};
I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Ask a bunch of questions.;
Participate in Voidwatch Ops.;
Request debriefing.;
Request ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
Request reward issuance.${prompt};
While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.${prompt};
Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel.;
Come back again once you have proven your worth.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You must be at least level ${number: 0} to participate in Voidwatch.;
Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!${prompt};
I see you've yet to be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.${prompt};
You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or “jurisdiction.”${prompt};
Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.${prompt};
While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].${prompt};
When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.;
The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.${prompt};
Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!${prompt};
Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.${prompt};
You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.;
This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.${prompt};
${choice: 1}[Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].

Ah, I daresay your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has undergone change!${prompt};
How many would you like?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Just one.;
Fill me up!${prompt};
Here is your additional ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} allocation.;
Make each and every one count, you hear?${prompt};
It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of ${number: 0} stones.;
I'm not authorized to provision you with more.${prompt};
I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[minute/minutes] (Earth time).${prompt};

Hm? It seems you already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
In that case, you won't be needing another.${prompt};
This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.${prompt};
This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.${prompt};
This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.${prompt};
This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.${prompt};
This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.${prompt};
A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.${prompt};
A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.${prompt};
A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.${prompt};

Voidstone consumption.${prompt};
“Voidwalker” is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.${prompt};
Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt};
While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt};
As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt};
To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt};
Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt};
Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt};
Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.;
Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt};
These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.;
They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt};
Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt};
The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt};
That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt};
Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt};
Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt};
Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt};
You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt};
Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt};
The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt};
When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt};
However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt};
Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt};
Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt};
But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt};
You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.;
In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt};
The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt};
To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt};
One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt};
All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt};
Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt};
For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt};
In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt};
Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt};
If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt};
Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.;
It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt};
Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt};
Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt};
Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt};
They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt};
(Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt};
They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt};
Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt};
Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.;
But I digress...${prompt};
Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt};
As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.;
Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt};
It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.;
Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt};
Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt};
Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt};
The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt};
I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt};
I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt};
Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt};
Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt};
Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.;
Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt};
And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt};
I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.;
Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt};
As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.;
Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt};
Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt};
Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.;
There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.;
Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt};
Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt};
As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.;
Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt};
The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.;
Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?;
Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt};
Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt};
If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt};
Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.;
The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt};
Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt};
"Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}";
Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt};
It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt};
If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt};
Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt};
As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.;
There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt};
Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt};
Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.;
If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt};
As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt};
Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt};
Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt};

Hello, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]!;
What brings ye to my humble abode? After a draught to fix up a cough, mayhap?${prompt};
Ah, it's always upliftin' to see a familiar face.;
To what do I owe ye the pleasure?${prompt};
Eh? Ye're seekin' a fiery-haired lass called Lilisette?;
Who happens to be Sir Ragelise's daughter, no less...${prompt};
Those be strange words ye speak...and would that they could be made reality.${prompt};
But folk hereabouts know all too well that Sir Ragelise and Lady Portia never had children.${prompt};
A couple painted in heaven, they were, yet fate didn't deem it fit to bless them with the joys of parenthood.${prompt};
One can only imagine the lil' angels they might've brought forth into the world.;
Why, the mere thought makes me wistful beyond words...${prompt};
Ah, ye must forgive me. This old woman's mind is wont to wander on occasion.${prompt};
Goin' back to your question, I'm afraid no Lilisette has come by here.${prompt};
Hm? A friend of yours suffers from an affliction similar to Sir Ragelise?${prompt};
And it be your wish to see him healed...${prompt};
Back in the day, a simple brew to relieve the pain was all I had to offer.;
But medicine is a livin', ever-evolvin' science. Mayhap the years've seen the discovery of a cure.${prompt};
I've been told there's a physician in Jeuno, a learned young man. Might be he can assist ye.${prompt};
Back in the day, a simple brew to relieve the pain was all I had to offer.;

I scarce had a moment for myself when last I visited. Everything felt like a blur.${prompt};

Hello, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]!;

What have we here, eh? If my memory's not mistaken--though like as not, it is--I've never laid eyes on such cuisine.${prompt};
Ah, a new culinary creation of old Thierride's, is it? Why, I can't recall the last time he sent me a sample.;
Let's try a mouthful, shall we?${prompt};
...${prompt};
M-my goodness! Such a delectable harmony of flavors!${prompt};
Ah, brings back memories, it does. Back in the day, Thierride would oft rely on my taste buds.;
As I recall, it'd be myself and this other little girl who'd attend the tastings.${prompt};
Oh, that girl loved Thierride's bean dishes so. The way her eyes would sparkle as she fell upon each bowl never once failed to bring a smile to my face.${prompt};
What she looked like, though, I can't seem to remember. Ah, curse this failin' memory.${prompt};
...But I do ramble. Apologies, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady].;
I'm sure ye've got better things to do than listenin' to a withered old woman's prattle.${prompt};

That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};

Well done, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/fair lady]! You have the eyes of an eagle! Without any further ado, here is your prize.${prompt};
Of course someone of as high a caliber as yourself would be able to triumph over even the most formidable of challenges. Here, you are more than deserving of this prize!${prompt};
As vital as it may be, it means absolutely nothing without the two other elements obtained from my compatriots in Bastok and Windurst.${prompt};
Hold on--I see that with this, you have accumulated all three pieces of this seasonal puzzle. All that is left now is for you to synthesize them.${prompt};
Allow me to reward you for the extra effort you have exerted. Use this with an ${item-singular: 1[2]}, and you can fill your Mog House with familiar and nostalgic melodies whenever you so desire.${prompt};
I am sorry, but that is incorrect. May Altana smile upon you one day, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/fair lady].${prompt};
Not all of us are blessed with immaculate perspicacity, but it shall come in time.${prompt};
A fair day to you, kind ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]! I am ${choice: 1}[Niscoliette/Prycillia/Chabobo], assistant to Atelloune. I suppose that makes me assistant to the assistant of his eminence, the great Professor Clavauert!${prompt};
We have made a fascinating discovery--chocobos, just like humans, are capable of falling in love!${prompt};
And you, my friend, come at the most fortuitous of times. How would you like to help me, erm...spur on the emotions of lovelorn chocobos?${prompt};
Too hoo hoo, came to lend your aid once more?;
(More data for my thesis...splendid!)${prompt};
Up for some chocobo matchmaking?;
${selection-lines};
I'm always up for a new experience!;
It'll only “breed” contempt.${prompt};
Splendiferous!;
And just so we're clear, this is all for the benefit of the chocobos. I wouldn't even THINK of using you for my own research gains!${prompt};
Is that so? I guess winning battles of the flesh doesn't mean you can win battles of the heart. Amateur.${prompt};
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.;
(<Sigh> I'll have to actually do my own research for once.)${prompt};
So, what's the first way into someone's heart? Presents! First, you'll need to search for and “dig up” a tantalizing gift!${prompt};

Kweeeeeeeeeeeeh!;

Kw--Kweeeh!${prompt};
The chocobo has unearthed ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
${prompt};
...${prompt};
You didn't find anything.;
Why, it's like the locations of these presents change depending on the day! Hmm? “Why do I know these things?” Silly, I'm a scholar!${prompt};
It's gotta be related to the day of the week. Call it women's intuition!${prompt};
Oh, come on! Cupid's arrows are supposed to strike true, not go tumbling to the ground!${prompt};
The chocobo whimpers in despair.;
Maybe he'll perk up a bit later? Why don't you give it another go then?${prompt};
You know what I do when I'm depressed? Eat some sweets. Maybe this poor fella just needs to eat something to cheer him up.${prompt};
Now that we've got a present, it's time for step two!${prompt};
Well, well, just what have you brought me? Oh, yes, this will do nicely. Our chocobo friend will be back up and kweh-ing in no time!${prompt};
The chocobo has a special twinkle in his eye.;
Next up: sweet nothings! Can't win the affections of the fairer sex without a silver tongue!${prompt};
Though they may not be able to comprehend your words, the language of love is universal!${prompt};
You've got a total of ${number: 0} chances. Think of it like speed dating! The glibber your jibe, the more they swoon!${prompt};
The chocobo is completely smitten!;
Absolutely perfect! You're no stranger to love, that's for sure!${prompt};
What's this? No sweet nothings? Yes, yes, I know that true love needs no words, but when a romance is still budding, you've got to give it your all! Or...would you rather call it quits?${prompt};
Most wondrous! Now that report of mine will be...<cough> Excuse me. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Quick, out with the magical phrase!${prompt};
The chocobo blinks and cocks his head to one side.;
Hmm... Maybe if you didn't beat around the bush? Try telling it like it is.${prompt};
Maybe these baby chocobos can provide some kind of hint?${prompt};
Now that you've found just the right words, it's time to take things to the next level!${prompt};
According to my volumes of data, it seems ${choice: 1}[you two have a chilly relationship, but don't give up yet!/you're on the cusp of winning its heart./you two are on fire! You might as well get hitched!];

Aw, you poor thing, looks like you chose the wrong path to love.${prompt};
W-wow! What a turn of events! Love knows no bounds, as the saying goes! Just wait until the profess... I mean, uh, good going!${prompt};
After all that hard work you did with your lovely present and those three magic words... Maybe love is all about luck and timing after all.${prompt};
Well done! My little cupid has veritable wings sprouting from ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] back! The more love, the more data...dates! Dates they will go on!${prompt};
With all you've done for me...err, the chocobos, it's only fair that I give you a little something in return. A token of my appreciation, if you will. Of course, you're welcome to come back any time!${prompt};
STEP2_DEBUG：${entity: 0}.${prompt};

Do you remember me? ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]?;
Of course you do!${prompt};
Thanks again for what goo did for us slimes a couple moons back.${prompt};
Why are we here again? Well, you see, Horro wanted to come back for more sweets <slurp>, so...${prompt};
Wait! I promise we didn't stow away for a second time! We asked him to let us come back on the Astoltia Ark, and he said yes!${prompt};
But, boy, we're in a bit of a pickle once more, and I'd be grateful if you could lend me a <slurp> hand.${prompt};
P-promise you won't?${wait-36: 1};
Oh, thank goodness <slurp>.${prompt};
My name's ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]. I really need somegoo's help, but I don't know where to turn.${prompt};
We came here on this big ship called the Astoltia Ark together with our friend, Horro.${prompt};
It isn't the first time we've been here, though. Last time <slurp> we kind of...stowed away and found ourselves in this world.${prompt};
We tried to behave, but ended up causing a lot of trouble for Horro and the great adventurgoos of Vana'diel.${prompt};
This time, we made sure to get permission, but things didn't go like we wanted...${prompt};
You see, some of our other friends--she-slimes and metal slimes--overheard our plan, and this time they stowed away instead!${prompt};
So when we arrived in Vana'diel, they went bouncing off to goo-knows-where!${prompt};
And if that wasn't bad enough, some of us more common slimes went off too!${prompt};
If I don't bring my friends back, Horro will <slurp> leave them behind!${prompt};
So you can guess what's next--I need your help.${prompt};
If you give me a hand I'll...${wait-36: 2};
Do a little jiggle for you!${prompt};
If you do really well, I'll even give you a little <slurp> something special! So, will you help?${prompt};
Help find his friends?;
${selection-lines};
Of course! I love jiggling!;
No, thanks. Too much work.${prompt};
Aww...${choice: 0}[/ Maybe a little jiggle isn't enough...]${prompt};
If you change your mind, I'll be right here waiting!${prompt};
Why, you're the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] from before, aren't you?${prompt};
Have you come to <slurp> help collect my friends?${prompt};
Yay! Thank you so much!${prompt};
Finding them is really easy! First, you have to go outside town and have ${choice: 0}[Slabble/Slime Tarou/Sline] cast a gootastic spell on you.${prompt};
The stowaways're probably scared here in this strange land, so they might get angry or <slurp> try to run away.${prompt};
Just give them a little thump on the head, and it'll turn 'em into slime coins.${prompt};
I'll make sure to thank you propergoo for helping find them!${prompt};
Oh, but there's one thing. The spells will make you just as weak as we are, so don't jump in without thinking!${prompt};
And I forgot something else! The she-slimes and metal slimes are a bit tougher <slurp>.${prompt};
The metal slimes in particular are really slippery. They could run right in front of you, and if you blinked, you'd never notice!${prompt};
But they'll give you more coins--and slurpier prizes--if you happen to goo 'em!${prompt};
I hope that's a good explanation. If you're ready and raring to go, I can send you to ${choice: 0}[Slabble/Slime Tarou/Slarin] right away.${prompt};
Be whisked outside town?;
${selection-lines};
On feathered wings!;
I'd prefer to stay here.${prompt};
Okay! Happy searching!${prompt};
I'll send you whenever you want, so just let me know!${prompt};
How wonderful is it to be <sneeze> back in Vana'diel. Let's see what ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] has to offer me this time!${prompt};
Thank goodness I have this “Ranpi-Monpi's Vana'dielian Three-Star Cuisine” guide to show me just where to go!${prompt};
Let me see...;
${number: 0} slime coins? Not bad!;

Ooooooh, but my guide recommends <wheeze> some ever-so-divine ${item-plural: 3[2]}!${prompt};
Hohoho, with so much to choose from, how can I possibly get my hands on everything?;
Better get started!${prompt};
Vana'diel is always abuzz, but I can't shake this feeling that <hack> there's something going on outside of town...${prompt};
But dear me! If I don't hurry, the stores might close!${prompt};
Or they might even run out of stock before I get there! Then there'll have been no point in coming!${prompt};
Goo...;
Since Horro hasn't finished his shopping, we still have some time left before the ark departs.${prompt};
So, please, <slurp> gather the rest of my friends before it's too late!${prompt};
Oh my, how lovely! Ranpi-Monpi was right about these ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};
O-oh no! Horro's done shopping!${prompt};
I've got to tell him what happened so he'll stay a while longer.${prompt};
Little one, ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] told me what happened.${prompt};
I-I'm <slurp> sorry...${prompt};
And if it isn't my young friend! I <sneeze> had a feeling I'd be seeing you again.${prompt};
I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you yet again.${prompt};
I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you.${prompt};
Here's a little something as a <cough> token of my appreciation.${prompt};
Yet somehow, I feel there are more slimes out there.${prompt};
But don't worry. <Wheeze> I've still got business in ${choice: 0}[Bastok/Windurst/San d'Oria].${prompt};
The ark will return here to ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] before we leave, so I'll make sure the slimes are all gathered up by then.${prompt};
Oh, Horro! You're so wonderful!${prompt};
Now, listen to me. I know Vana'diel is a fun place, and you want to explore <cough> all it has to offer, but you must be more careful!${prompt};
My friend, I hope our paths cross once more.${prompt};
But until that fateful day, I <sniffle> bid you farewell!${prompt};
Mmm, but what about a few ${item-plural: 2[2]}...?${prompt};
I'm glad that Horro was so understanding <slurp>!${prompt};
And thank goo for finding my friends!${prompt};
I'm sure I'll be able to goother the rest of them before we leave.${prompt};
But if you want to see another one of my fine performances, just <slurp> stop by again!${prompt};
Oh! Oh!;
Horro gave me something special for you! He must be really goorateful!${prompt};
Hey, you--able adventurer!;
Cast your gaze on the countenance of this misbegotten mutant.${prompt};
Glance at the good-natured glimmer in his eyes!${prompt};
Take in his tiny teeth scintillating in the sunlight, kupo!${prompt};
You mean...you're familiar with its furry form?${prompt};
Oh hush, hustler. Listen to the lowdown before you loosen your lips.${prompt};
Remember the gristly green gobs who came before? Now its mauve and maroon mates have come to wreak wrongdoings upon our realm!${prompt};
At least, I suppose so. They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there should be nothing nagging at my noggin after all...${prompt};
Let me tell you a troubled tale. Not long ago, some grisly green gobs came to Vana'diel, and we amassed a fabulous fortune crafting countless curios in their likeness.${prompt};
But there was an--inconsequential?--issue with them consuming crystals like crunchy candies.${prompt};
Thanks to hardy heroes and moogle magic, we turned them into cerulean stone shards and sent them scurrying home, kupo.${prompt};
But we gave the victors great gifts resembling those rowdy ruffians, so our profits plummeted and we had to cancel our tropical travel plans...${prompt};
But the past is in the past. We must make the most of the moment!${prompt};
And so! With the multicolored monsters now manifesting themselves, we found our next best chance!${prompt};
They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there's nothing to knock my noggin over...${prompt};
Thus, we have an ostensibly outstanding opportunity to manufacture new knickknacks, kupo!${prompt};
Part of the proceeds will be diverted to do up dilapidated Mog Houses, with the rest funding our jovial jaunts!${prompt};
Kupopopo!;
How magnificently marvelous!${prompt};
You can't discern the difference between the dimensional delegates?${prompt};
Give them a good glance!${prompt};
I guess their terrible teeth and enchanting eyes do look alike...${prompt};
But the metal in their mitts and trinkets on their waists! Those are different, kupo!${prompt};
Wonderful!;
We can cut down on costs and rake in the revenue!;
Vivacious vacations for all!${prompt};
A-ah! Forget my frivolous fettering.${prompt};
But if we captured the cerulean creatures before, then how did they surreptitiously scuttle back?${prompt};
Undeniably unimportant. What matters most is the moment!${prompt};
Oh ho? A covert communique from my cohort in charge of the stone shard storage.${prompt};
Yes? Mm hmm... Mm hmm...${prompt};
Altana kupo it all!${prompt};
The ones we previously petrified have escaped, and they're traipsing outside town!${prompt};
Then again, the clock was ticking on the enchantment expiring.${prompt};
...And now a nuanced notification from outside town? Oh, dear.${prompt};
Th-then it's true, kupo!${prompt};
Great gasping Goblins! Those furry freaks are capturing crystals again!${prompt};
And their bespeckled brethren are helping, kupo!${prompt};
If they succeed in pilfering our precious prizes, Vana'diel will descend into a desolate decay!${prompt};
And worse, snafu will surely stain the M.H.M.U.'s resplendent reputation!${prompt};
Most excellent explorer, please travel outside town and round up these recidivist reprobates!${prompt};
A mixture of moogle magic will enable you to ensconce the evildoers by subjugating them into stone shards.${prompt};
Of course, I'll reward your righteousness with the requisite remuneration, kupo.${prompt};
But since we have such a short supply of stuff, I have to let Lady Luck look upon you with...a lottery!${prompt};
The most prestigious prizes are awarded in the order of mauve, vermilion, and chartruese stone shards.${prompt};
The goods we've gathered can be chosen from a long list that lengthens depending on your success.${prompt};
Simply stated, if you procure first prize, you can select spoils from lower levels should you deign to do so. And so on.${prompt};
This is a dire dilemma, so I shall send you off to the outskirts immediately. Are you ready, kupo?${prompt};
Be teleported outside of town?;
${selection-lines};
You bet!;
I don't think so.${prompt};
Ready and raring to go!;
The M.H.M.U.--and all Vana'diel--appreciates your assistance!${prompt};
O-oh dear, kupo...;
But we really require reinforcements! Please reconsider, kupo!${prompt};
You have phenomenally procured a prodigious amount of ${number: 0} chartruese stone shard${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], ${number: 1} vermilion stone shard${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and ${number: 2} mauve stone shard${choice-plurality: 0}[/s]. What would you like, kupo?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Check the item list.;
Warp outside town.;
Nothing.${prompt};
You have not harvested a sufficient supply of ${choice: 3}[mauve stone shards/vermilion stone shards/chartruese stone shards], kupo! Clobber more critters and come back later!${prompt};

Love you! Looove! Loooooove!${prompt};
Happy! Much happy! For you! Yooou!${prompt};
I have! Still have! No need more!${prompt};
I had no idea just how unprepared most adventurers in these parts are...${prompt};
My superior told me to “meet an adventurer who has set the first objective from the 'Objective List' under the 'Records of Eminence' section of the Quests menu,” but I feel I will wither and die before that ever happens. What the heck is a “quest menu,” anyway?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Pick it up.;
Watch and wait.;
Walk away.${prompt};
How will I ever be able to show my beautiful yet shamed face to my superiors again?${prompt};
Oh my, what a stunning coincidence!;
I had long given up on the hope of bumping into someone who satisfied that tall list of requirements!${prompt};
You would not happen to be knowledgeable about the subject of “Records of Eminence,” would you?${prompt};
Well, are you?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Nope.${prompt};
Splendid!;
Then you have saved both me from losing any more of my time and you from a long-winded explanation!${prompt};
Completely understandable. I myself had not heard of the system until I was charged with disseminating information on it to the masses.${prompt};
Interestingly enough, this conversation is undeniable proof that you have already begun to participate in Records of Eminence.${prompt};
As you will see in this mandate--um, manual--it says “set the first objective from the 'Objective List'” and everything.${prompt};
As you know, you have cleared this first objective with flying colors.${prompt};
In honor of your accomplishment, I would like to present you with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
It slinks up from nowhere like an assassin, and it stares with such creepy intensity that you cannot help but...uh...think how adorable it is. <Whisper> Do you think it's listening!?${prompt};
Each time you clear an objective, the details are recorded within the frame of this eerie doll.;
On a brighter note, you also receive a quantified measure of your eminence, termed “sparks.”${prompt};
Oh, of course.;
I as well cannot stand how that doll stares daggers into the depths of my soul.${prompt};
At least its inventor was magnanimous enough to bestow it with this special function!${prompt};
Amazing, is it not?;
I hear it is all attributable to an “astral patina.” Sadly, I do not understand much more about it than that.${prompt};
What I do know is that your recipe for success is to set your objectives periodically. That way you can complete them while on your adventures and garner as many sparks as possible!${prompt};
Moreover, some objectives only appear after you complete a certain amount of others. There is always a chance you will be surprised when you check!${prompt};
In the event you have forgotten how to set objectives, go to the “Objective List” under the “Records of Eminence” section of the Quests menu. From there you simply pick those most suited to your current undertakings.${prompt};
I suggest partaking in a variety of objectives, including the ones that may be repeated.${prompt};
Then, when you accrue a sufficient amount of eminence, come to me or one of my friends. We have many a reward stockpiled and ready to enter your veteran hands.${prompt};
In summation, with benefits more inflated than even the Royal Guard's sense of self-worth and absolutely no downside, why would you not give this a shot?${prompt};
...Hmmm.;
Upon further inspection, you do not seem to be as reliable as I first thought. Please consult with Alaune to learn the ins and outs of adventuring before approaching me again.${prompt};
Oh, and as that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has irrevocably bonded to you, there is no need to return it. All we can do with it is throw it to the wendigos if you don't keep it.${prompt};
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).;
Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} nods in agreement.;
${color-alt: 138}A new Records of Eminence objective is now available!;

You wish to exchange your sparks?;
Wait but a moment.;
Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.${prompt};
Ah, this almost slipped my mind.;
Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.${prompt};
Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.${prompt};
Thanks to your donation, I now have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} in safekeeping.${prompt};
Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.;
Hold your hoarder hares, ${choice-player-gender}[hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer.;
Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.${prompt};
Oh, crud, that's right.;
You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
“Why?” What a good question!;
Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.${prompt};
Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you.${prompt};
You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?;
Let me wake up from my catnap first...${wait-36: 1};
Alright, now rrread this.${prompt};
Wait, wait, wait!;
If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.${prompt};
Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...${prompt};
...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.${prompt};
Grrreat! Now I have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you. Thanks!${prompt};
Hm?;
Oh, spark exchange... Of course.;
I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.${prompt};
Let me add one thing.;

Hail, friend! No need to be so fleet of foot. Come, let me impart upon you a tantalizing morsel of information.${prompt};
A ${choice: 1}[freshly hatched/well-traveled/high-class] adventurer such as yourself could surely appreciate the offer I am about to lay forth for your consideration.${prompt};
I, Gondebaud, am an esteemed member of the storied Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies.${prompt};
Mayhap I am repeating what you already know, but Jeuno is a grand city far to the southeast of here that connects the Quon and Mindartia continents.${prompt};
The leading council has bid me come to this fair land of San d'Oria with a most sacred mission.${prompt};
Several moons past, our famed institute held a lavish symposium at which we made privy to the public information about a new form of magic.${prompt};
These new forms of incantations, which we call “Trust,” would prove a mighty boon to adventurers of your caliber.${prompt};
A bevy of new experiences await should you choose to participate in this grand experiment. Will you embark on a journey to this fresh new world?${prompt};
Participate in the experiment?;
${selection-lines};
I'd love to.;
I'm not sure it's for me.${prompt};
You leave my jaw so agape that I fear my dentures are starting to slip!${prompt};
How fortuitous! I swear by every gray hair on this head that you will not regret it!;
Your first task is to head to the city gates in Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
There you will find someone engaged in the running of “Ballista,” a type of mock skirmish. Some call him by the moniker of “the grand hero of San d'Oria.”${prompt};
As you have already surmised, experimental magic may have unknown effects on the world, so he is very careful to ensure the safety of everyone involved.${prompt};
In fact, he is so dedicated to this goal that he himself stepped up as the nation's first participant in the program.${prompt};
The two other grand nations--Bastok and Windurst--have also seen others step up to try their hand at this wonderful manifestation of the arcane.${prompt};
But we will leave those journeys for a later date. Your first step starts here, in San d'Oria, where you will garner the services of one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.${prompt};
Participate here in San d'Oria?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
As I previously alluded to, there are more like me stationed in the other nations. They will guide you in much the same way, so please--lend an ear when you travel abroad.${prompt};
Stupendous! Under my expert tutelage here in San d'Oria, you will surely grasp the basics of Trust in no time!${prompt};
Take this letter of introduction with you and head to Ranperre Gate in Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
To get to Northern San d'Oria, you must first head west of here, then north toward Victory Square.${prompt};
After reaching Northern San d'Oria, you are to make for Ranperre Gate. Once there, seek out Excenmille--and pray do not affront him in any fashion. The words of a hero such as he carry unmatched weight in this land.${prompt};
Do you require an explanation as to what Trust is?${prompt};
Inquire about what?;
${selection-lines};
What Trust is.;
What happens when one uses Trust.;
How to learn new Trust spells.;
Whereabouts of Trust participants.;
Nothing at the moment.${prompt};
Trust is a new series of magical incantations woven into being by the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies, announced at our recent symposium.${prompt};
Mayhaps the term “incantations” is a trifle misleading. Rather than draw upon aetheric manipulation, Trust taps into the spiritual connection between those bound by ${choice-player-gender}[fraternal/sororal] love.${prompt};
To lead you to my explanation's logical conclusion, I'll say this magic can be utilized regardless of its wielder's vocation. Both simple and profitable.${prompt};
As the technique is reliant upon the connection between two souls, interference by a profusion of souls, such as in cities, renders the technique unusable.${prompt};
Using Trust magic enables the caster to call forth alter egos of those with whom ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has formed bonds of friendship and trust.${prompt};
As this technique utilizes the resonance between two kindred spirits, the alter ego which manifests always matches the caster, be they weak or strong.${prompt};
Journeys are much more satisfying when you have a companion, don't you think? The alter ego you summon will fight bravely by your side, but you will be unable to present them with detailed tactical orders.${prompt};
If you wish to return the alter ego from whence it came, you only need speak to it and express your desire. A bittersweet moment, to be sure.${prompt};
Alter egos suffer wounds just like you and I, and if one falls in battle, it will wink out of existence. To watch one so dear fade away...it brings a tear to your eye, does it not?${prompt};
Yet fret not, my disciple! After just a short while you will be able to bring it back to the world once more. Your sadness will be but whispers on the wind.${prompt};
Bringing forth an alter ego is not a simple process. You must first forge intangible bonds with those whose aid you wish to enlist.${prompt};
Carefully cultivate trust and respect between yourself and a practitioner, as this technique cannot work unless the bonds between you be surer than steel.${prompt};
Know you the adage “opposites attract”? Assuredly, such is not the case here. Storied personages have little time for those whose deeds are not sung as widely as their own.${prompt};
But all I have just told you can be circumvented, as research into new methods of calling forth alter egos has been ongoing. It is possible to summon one without having so much as met the person.${prompt};
As you can imagine, this requires a bit of tinkering with the aether, but it is indeed possible. All I require is the appropriate scroll.${prompt};
Do you wish to drink from the font of knowledge?${prompt};
${choice: 3}[Excenmille/Naji/Kupipi/Curilla/Ayame/Nanaa Mihgo/Trion/Volker/Ajido-Marujido/Iron Eater/Prishe/Ulmia/Shikaree Z/Cherukiki/Gadalar/Zazarg/Nashmeira/Gessho/Ingrid/Maat/Arciela/Chacharoon] can be found in ${choice: 2}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Tavnazia/Aht Urhgan/Adoulin/the Mod Gardens].${prompt};

Oh ho! You've got ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} on hand, do you?${prompt};
Funny story, that. They are also involved in the Trust initiative.${prompt};
I must bow my head in appreciation for all that you and your ilk have done for us. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.${prompt};
I am more than pleased to report that your activities on our behalf have aided the institute in posting never-before-seen results.${prompt};
Always cherish the bonds you have formed with that person, for such resilient ties take years--decades!--to form.${prompt};
May your trust and friendship blossom into the envy of all!${prompt};
Wh-who? This old mind does not work like it used to, for I know not one whit about that person.${prompt};
Bah! What exactly am I supposed to do with this pile of nonsense?${prompt};
But lest you think otherwise, it is the parchment to blame. Some strange energy prevents it from being properly read.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana'diel.;
Even I cannot tell who this cipher is supposed to call. Let me get out my reading glasses and take a gander, hmm?${prompt};
Oho! A strange apparition, you say?${prompt};
Glad I could help you reach even greater heights. May you enjoy many bright years with your new companion.${prompt};
Though I perhaps should not share this information with one not of the institute, lately we have been pushing the limits of the Trust initiative beyond just the five races.${prompt};
Let us get down to business, you say? Use these newfound powers?${prompt};
Then we shall commune together. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt};
A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt};
Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt};
You know about this all-important Trust initiative already? Rumors truly do spread like wildfire on a dry summer day.${prompt};
Whether my compatriots in Bastok or Windurst informed you is of little consequence. What matters most is that you are here--and wish to engage in the trials we San d'Orians can offer.${prompt};
Oh ho! Is that ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} you have there mayhap?${prompt};
Doctor Monberaux is a doctor of much renown throughout Jeuno. I have been meaning to have him take a look at my creaky old back.${prompt};
By the by, when we spoke with him about helping us with our Trust magic, he asked if his friend could join too.${prompt};
It seems his friend Wolf-something is quite popular with ladies of a certain age such as Ilumida. He received quite a glowing recommendation.${prompt};
Unfortunately, things ended up being a bit complicated. No, it was not like anybody was jealous of him or anything.${prompt};
Now, where was I... Oh yes, we were talking about Doctor Monberaux. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt};
A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt};
Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt};
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to find obscure crabs in someone's Mog Garden. I must make preparations for a survey this instant.${prompt};
Pleased to meet you, new recruit.;
Is there anything about which you wish to inquire?${prompt};
Inquire about what?;
${selection-lines};
I want to find some quests!;
I want to try the tutorial event!;

I want a map of the area I'm in!;
I want maps of the whole city!;
How do I give items to people?;
How do I fight outside town?;
What are quests and missions?;
Tell me more about Southern San d'Oria!;
I have other questions.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
I can mark the locations of important people on your map of the San d'Oria area, should you require it.${prompt};
You can find a map peddler taking refuge in the shade of a tree to the southwest, near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
There is an elderly woman near the fountain due south of here who will be more than happy to sell you maps.${prompt};
There are people willing to sell you maps in both Northern and Southern San d'Oria, but the vendor in Northern San d'Oria is closer...if you are in a hurry.${prompt};
Our kingdom has prepared a special tour of duty for newly enlisted troops such as you. Hopefully you make the best of it.${prompt};
To begin the journey, simply talk to Alaune in Southern San d'Oria. She resides near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, head directly south and pass through the gate leading to Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, ascend the stairs that lead southwest, which should take you to Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
Once there, proceed southward until you reach Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
I shall mark her position upon your map so you may locate her more easily once you are in that vicinity.${prompt};
It is possible to check who has been marked on your map by opening the “Map” menu, selecting the “Markers” option, and then scrolling to the right.${prompt};
Performing a “Wide Scan” from the “Map” menu also allows you to locate people in your vicinity, should that method prove more convenient.${prompt};
Whether decorated in battle or recently enlisted, all can benefit from trying their hand at Records of Eminence. It is a simple method for participating in Vana'diel's many adventures, and bestows rewards all its own.${prompt};
Open the main menu, go right to get to the next screen, and select “Objective List” under the “Quests” submenu.${prompt};
Select “Tutorial,” head to “Basics,” and accept the objective “First Step Forward” to get started down this magnificent road.${prompt};
Permit me to provide you with a hint for completing “First Step Forward.”${prompt};
Find the person designated by the objective in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark their location on your map.${prompt};
Records of Eminence contains a plethora of objectives, many of which will surely fit your play style. It would behoove you to take advantage of this opportunity.${prompt};
The Trust initiative is a special magic regimen developed by one of the world's finest academies of magic.${prompt};
Those who successfully undergo training will be bestowed with the ability to call forth powerful allies into battle.${prompt};
Only adventurers who have proven their worth by achieving level five are eligible to participate. I will provide you with further information when you reach that landmark.${prompt};
Gondebaud is their representative, and he is stationed in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark his location on your map should you desire to make further inquiries.${prompt};
If you harbor doubts about something I have not yet touched upon, first open the main menu. From there, scroll right to the second page and select the “Help Desk” option.${prompt};
Once you have done that, select “Help Desk” again from the list of categories that appears in the new window. Finally, enter the section entitled “I need help with the game controls.”${prompt};
The answer to your question likely lies there.${prompt};
Though I wish the situation were less dire, there exist many who require your aid.;
Do you wish to reference the materials I have gathered on them?${prompt};

The action of handing over objects to others is termed “trading” here. To trade items to people, open the main menu--which will appear on the right-hand side of your screen--and select “Trade.”${prompt};
In the event you have neglected to target your interlocutor, please do so after selecting the “Trade” option. Afterwards, choose the item or items you wish to bequeath in the window that appears and hit “OK.”${prompt};
This process will be an integral part of the quests and missions you shall undertake in the future, so I entreat you to commit it to memory.${prompt};
Should you be in possession of ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, please trade it to me. In return, I shall bestow some monetary remunerations upon you, care of the monarchy.${prompt};
It would behoove you to remember the following points when engaging in combat outside the city gates. One: outfit yourself with weapons and armor. Two: magic spells are learned from scrolls.${prompt};
Thirdly--and of the utmost import--is that you “check” your adversaries before challenging them. It would not do for you to go charging into battle against an enemy who thoroughly outclasses you.${prompt};
Finally, never forget to check your spoils of war.${prompt};
Tasks issued by residents of the city for you to complete are called “quests.” Simply fulfill the requirements, such as procuring the desired item, to receive a reward.${prompt};
On the other hand, orders handed down directly from those involved with the nation's administration are called “missions.” Converse with the guard by the gate for a more detailed explanation.${prompt};
Open the “Map” option from the main menu, select “Markers,” and then scroll to the right. That will tell you where you need to go.${prompt};
Selecting “Map” from the main menu opens the map of the area in which you currently reside. Select “Markers” and press the right arrow key to see all the markers placed on your map.${prompt};

Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha?;
Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!${prompt};
While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it.;
Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum.;
Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.${prompt};
Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm! ${wait-36: 1};
Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'.;
Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?${prompt};
Oh yeah, 'fore I forget.;
What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.${prompt};
Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...${prompt};
Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes.;
Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more.;
Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.${prompt};
Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer “daily tally.”;
It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.${prompt};
Finally, ya opens da chest.;
Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!${prompt};
Oh, dat's right!;
Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase!;
Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?${prompt};
And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy!;
But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.${prompt};
Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it.;
Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.${prompt};
Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble.;
It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.${prompt};
Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in.;
Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.${prompt};
Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.${prompt};
Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.${prompt};
I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!${prompt};
Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?${prompt};
Dese're some “special dials,” an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!${prompt};
Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese “special dials”? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.${prompt};
So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.${prompt};
'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.${prompt};

Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.${prompt};
Dere we goes.;
Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?${prompt};
Dere we goes.${wait-36: 1};

You must be really special to be able to change forms like that! But I could tell who you were right away!${prompt};
My friends and I are playing a fun game called “sunshine seeker,” where we search for shards of sunlight!${prompt};
Just give them a little squeeze and you'll see how warm and bright they are!${prompt};

I'll give you some small seeds in exchange for the shards of sunlight you bring back.${prompt};
Even better! I've got some special things available for you to buy with your seeds!${prompt};
But here's the best part--If you try your luck with my grab bag enough times, you might win something really super!${prompt};
One of the rules of the game is that you must be a mandragora, like me, or else you won't be able to collect any shards.${prompt};
They can be found all around here. But if you don't hurry, someone else might gobble them up.${prompt};
But once you've taken them from one place, you can't get any more from there by searching it repeatedly!${prompt};
Shards of sunlight are really delicate, so they'll disappear if you leave this area or take too much time getting them back to me.${prompt};
My friends'll also try to get in your way, so be sure not to get noticed!${prompt};
I can fly you right to the starting point. Just say the word!${prompt};

My friends'll try to get in your way even more. Are you sure you're ready?${prompt};
Wow! I'll bet you're ready for the championship round!${prompt};
My friends'll surely never let you get away now! Sure you want to try anyway?${prompt};
Oh no...you mean you didn't find even one single shard? That's terrible...${prompt};
I'll be waiting for you to play our game again!${prompt};

What was that strange solar phenomenon? The number of shards of sunlight has increased, but Babban's friends are also moving faster than normal!${prompt};
The sun returns to normal. There are fewer shards of sunlight available, but Babban's friends are also moving slower.${prompt};
Time's up! Your quest for sunlight has ended in failure.${prompt};
You've left the area, causing your quest for sunlight to end in failure.${prompt};
You've failed to acquire any shards of sunlight. Your quest ends in failure.${prompt};
I understand that you are...an adventurer?;
My name is Pieuje I. d'Oraguille, commander of San d'Oria's famed Temple Knights.${prompt};
Is that ${name-player}'s voice I hear?${prompt};
Forgive me, but I am more accustomed to recognizing faces than voices, especially through such a peculiar device.${prompt};
I must thank you for your handling of the Altedour incident in Fei'Yin.${prompt};
Never once have I forgotten your dedication to protecting all of San d'Oria.${prompt};
As you are doubtlessly aware, a short time ago I received a memorandum from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network detailing Unity Concord and requesting my services as a Unity leader.${prompt};
Tell me. Is there any greater way for a prince regent to earn honor for his kingdom than by spearheading a group dedicated to purging evil from the land?${prompt};
Many around me were opposed, but that bothered me not. My brother, Trion, serves as a representative of the Trust initiative, and it falls to me to up the ante.${prompt};
I cannot lie. That was an important factor in my decision.${prompt};
But be not concerned with our internal squabbles. Know only that it pleases me to welcome you to my Unity.${prompt};
My name is Ayame, a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers. Pleased to make your acquaintance.${prompt};
Haha...yes, ${name-player}, of course I remember you. How characteristic of you to have your fingers in everyone's pies.${prompt};
Do not think me ungrateful. No, I am always pleased to have your help, but this time things are a bit different.${prompt};
Do not think me ungrateful. You strengthened the Mythril Musketeers in ways I never thought possible, and we are closer than ever before.${prompt};
Not terribly long ago I was contacted by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, which asked that I head a Unity.${prompt};
At first I was flustered and thought of turning the offer down. Why would they pick me when there are others more qualified?${prompt};
But Volker decided it would be the perfect opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills, and told them I would accept...without my knowledge.${prompt};
Though unconvinced that I am the best fit, I pledge to dedicate myself wholly to this endeavor.${prompt};
People are counting on me. Not only Volker, but those like you who have pledged their support.${prompt};
I will not let you down.${prompt};
Stand sharp, maggot! I've got no time for people who're gonna slack off!${prompt};
...Wait. That's you, isn't it, ${name-player}?${prompt};
I hear you've decided to join my backbreaking Unity.${prompt};
Well!? What've you got to say for yourself!?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
That's right.;
Nope.;
Y-yessir!${prompt};
Impudent cretin! You say “sir” when addressing a superior officer!${prompt};
Better. Everyone in my Unity is equal--you're all worthless whelps!${prompt};
We don't coddle the weak around here. If you want respect, you earn it.${prompt};
Until then, you're just a dried-up, shriveled worm!${prompt};
So go crawling around in the dirt and pray some crow doesn't sweep down and gobble you up!${prompt};
Now get out there!${prompt};
Hello, good adventurer. You can call me Apururu.${prompt};
Is that...${name-player}? Am I rightaru?${prompt};
Your good deeds on behalf of Windurstaru have not gone unnoticed.${prompt};
I'm so worried about my brother...but if this is one way for me to help-welp him, then so be it.${prompt};
Ajido-Marujido has awoken at lastaru, but...no, I'll not let myself cry. I must work for the good of Windurst.${prompt};
You brought hope to a Windurst that was on the brink-wink of despair.${prompt};
I've been selected to serve as the head of a Unity-wunity, and can I ever say...${prompt};
As the head of the Manustery, there can be no greater honor than--${prompt};
Aaaaaall right! Now the Cardian workshop can finally turn something resembling a profitaru!${prompt};
tHiS iS aBsoLUtElY WonDErFul. NoW wE HaVe MOneY, ALl ThaNkS tO APurURu!${prompt};
H-hey! It's not like I'll be making bank-wank!${prompt};
Putting that aside--welcome to my Unitaru!${prompt};
We can do together-wether what we couldn't individually.${prompt};
Phew...;
So you're my new pupil, eh?${prompt};
Phew...;
So you're my new pu... ${name-player}?${prompt};
The way you shone when the two of us met in combat...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.${prompt};
I've gotta say, you sure knew how to show me the old what-for...it was like staring into the face of a demon!${prompt};
I've lived many years on this green Vana'diel, but you're the only one I've ever proffered my hat to.${prompt};
...Let's discuss how all this came to be.${prompt};
The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network came up with this “Unity” idea, and asked me to be one of its founding masters.${prompt};
But I'm not the kind to take on disciples, so at first I was more than a bit wary.${prompt};
But the old lady, she nagged me, and nagged me, and nagged me until I finally caved in.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
You can always quit, you know.;
Must have been tough for you.;
That's quite the wife you've got.${prompt};
Ugh...;
I didn't expect you to come at me with that.${prompt};
Tough doesn't begin to describe it! I was hoping to spend my twilight years for myself, but you gotta play the hand you're dealt.${prompt};
Please tell me that you weren't in on it!${prompt};
Either way, that's not important now. As long as I'm the master of a ragtag group of youngsters, I'm gonna make sure you all get the training you deserve.${prompt};
But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.${prompt};
And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.${prompt};
And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!${prompt};
What's the password?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Rose on the heath.;
Tavnazia.;
${prompt};
Who's this!?;
...Ah, this is the Unity communication device. Forget I said anything.${prompt};
Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.${prompt};
Who's this!?;
...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're ${name-player}, aren't you?${prompt};
The way this little thing is buzzing tells me that you're looking to join my Unity.${prompt};
“My” Unity being the key here. Who else did you expect to be the leader?${prompt};
I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.${prompt};
Serve the Unity well and I promise you'll want for nothing.${prompt};
You found hope where once I had lost it. Lion was alive and I'll never forget all you've done.${prompt};
All that she had worked and fought for...we owe it to her to live our lives to the fullest.${prompt};
Working with others for a common goal is the greatest reward of all.${prompt};
And it's people like you who I need to understand that most.${prompt};
Well, do we have a new rrrecruit? I'm Jakoh Wahcondalo, chieftainess of Kazham.${prompt};
Come to think of it...didn't I teach you the secrets of eviscerrration?${prompt};
Hah-hah-hah! Then all the better for my Unity!${prompt};
Are you sure...are you sure you're not currrsed by ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Can never be too carrreful these days...${prompt};
Let's cut to the quick. You've joined my Unity, corrrect?${prompt};
Then welcome.${prompt};
But a quick word of warrrning.${prompt};
I'm in charrrge here, so don't go about being disruptive!${prompt};
If you can do that, we'll have no prrroblems. Now get to it!${prompt};
H-hello, you've reached Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
There's no problem we can't solve, big or small!${prompt};
Aha, we have a new visitor? One moment--I'll get the president for you.${prompt};
Yes, this is Naja Salaheem.${prompt};
Ah, have we an adventurerrr applying today?${prompt};
You could not have picked a betterrr place to be.${prompt};
Our Unity is completely free of charge, making it the purrrfect place to hang up your sword and meet some new companions.${prompt};
We considerrr it our calling to provide an excellent place for those of all strrripes to utilize their talents in a variety of combat scenes.${prompt};
Abquhbah! Get your lazy butt over here!${prompt};
S-sorry. Yes, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/my lady], this is Abquhbah of Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
We have a variety of powerful backers supporting our organization...${prompt};
...So I'm certain you'll find achieving a high Unity ranking to be a breeze.${prompt};
And if we do, then there will be a lovely gift of sweets waiting. Yes, some gold pieces of--${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Oh, heavens, I think this device isn't worrrking properly. Can you hear me now?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Loud and clear.;
Where's Abquhbah?;
Just what did you do?${prompt};
Please forrrgive his impudence.${prompt};
We're looking forward to having you serrrve in our regiment.${prompt};
And we hope you enjoy your looong stay in our rrranks!${prompt};
Oho? Is that ${name-player} I hear?${prompt};
${name-player}? Gimme that!${prompt};
Picturrre that, hearing from ${choice: 0}[a non-employee/a second class private/a first class private/a superior private/a lance corporal/a corporal/a sergeant/a sergeant major/a chief sergeant/a second lieutenant/a first lieutenant/a captain] such as yourself.${prompt};
You've got some gall shirrrking your duties like this!${prompt};
But since you've joined my Unity, I'm willing to overlook that little trrransgression.${prompt};
Let's paint the rankings rrred with our unstoppable team!${prompt};
And that rrrequires you to not sit around like some good-for-nothing! You belong not just to one of my teams, but to two!${prompt};
Be thankful you have work and get your butt out there!${prompt};
The magic doll you are trying to reach is either suffering from mystical interference or is not attuned to a bearer.${prompt};
Please check the settings and try a-again...;
Mmph...${prompt};
Ahaha! Who can ever resist a good joke?;
It's me, and no other!${prompt};
How do you react?;
${selection-lines};
Flaviria?;
Arciela?;
Who?${prompt};
Oho, expertly deduced! I'd expect no less!${prompt};
Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...${prompt};
Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...${prompt};
But let's get down to business.${prompt};
I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.${prompt};
I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.${prompt};
The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?${prompt};
Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.${prompt};
Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?${prompt};
And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.${prompt};
I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!${prompt};
Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.${prompt};
Ahem. <Cough-ethy>${prompt};
So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?${prompt};
Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.${prompt};
Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.${prompt};
Ah, I know that voice-ethy! ${name-player}, that's you, isn't it?${prompt};
Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.${prompt};
Listen ${name-player}. Those three monstrosities you so kindly brought into my life have put me in a very disconcerting situation-ethy. I have a lot more to say about it, but for now let's focus-ethy on the issue at hand.${prompt};
Things have slowly gone back to normal-ethy now that the wretched trio of chaos incarnate has left. I've finally managed to begin work-ethy on my next book.${prompt};
Thank you again for your aid during the Shantotto crisis-ethy. Were it not for you, our entire dimension would have been twisted and defiled beyond recognition. I still get nightmares-ethy thinking about it.${prompt};
You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.${prompt};
One of these students was part of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.${prompt};
I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.${prompt};
But then I thought-ethy some more.${prompt};
Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?${prompt};
With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.${prompt};
And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.${prompt};

.........${prompt};
Oh! Right! I should probably say something.;
I'm Sylvie. As you can probably guess from these clothes. I'm a geomanger--I mean, geomancer!${prompt};
Oh, I forgot...you can't see my clothes, right? Forget I said that, okay?${prompt};
Oh, huh?;
${name-player}? Is that ${name-player}?${prompt};
Oh, ${name-player}, it's you.${prompt};
${name-player}! It's ${name-player}!${prompt};
How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet? If you keep your head and shoulders to the grindstone I'm sure you'll master it!${prompt};
I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?${prompt};
Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.${prompt};
I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you ${name-player}.${prompt};
It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!${prompt};
So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?${prompt};
Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.;
As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.${prompt};
Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.${prompt};
But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?${prompt};
So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.${prompt};
You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.${prompt};
...Right, smile Sylvie! Let's make this Unity work. With you as part of the team, I'm sure our efforts will bring us bear fruit.;
Huh...why do they call it “bear fruit”?${prompt};
Wait, so does this mean you'll be joining my Unity?${prompt};
As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.${prompt};
With you on our team, we'll be truly unstoppableable!${prompt};
To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what to do when the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network first invited me.${prompt};
If it weren't for Ikhi's guidance, I'd be down a creek full of paddles.${prompt};
She said if the Unity could show people everywhere how to communicate with nature and spread the ways of the geomancer, then it was something worth doing.${prompt};
There's still a lot I don't know as a geomancer, but I'm going to triple down and do my best as UL.${prompt};
Let's make this the best Unity we can!${prompt};
Yeah, go team!${prompt};
And...if you happened to be in Western Adoulin...and are also interested in geomancy, come see me by the docks. Wait, but not like...in a weird way, okay?${prompt};

Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt};
Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt};
“Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt};
Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt};
Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt};
Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt};
You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt};
Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt};
The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt};
Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt};
Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt};
“Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt};
These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt};
Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt};
Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt};
A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt};
Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt};
Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt};
When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt};
Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt};
No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt};
You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt};
An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt};
One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt};
A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt};
You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt};
Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt};
Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt};
Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt};
The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt};
It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt};
The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt};
Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt};
These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt};
Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt};
Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt};
You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt};
This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt};
This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt};
However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt};
Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt};
Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt};
Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt};
On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt};
Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt};
Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt};
Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt};
Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt};
A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt};
Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt};
A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt};
It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt};
Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.;
${color-alt: 138}The A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.;
${color-alt: 138}You call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.;
${color-alt: 138}You have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.;
${color-alt: 138}Should you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?;
Teleport anyway?;

${selection-lines};
How do I participate?;
Let me sleep on it.${prompt};
But...why? I only want what's best for you!${prompt};
Oh-ho-ho...;
I bet you say that to all the Unity Concord guides♪.${prompt};
Getting started is very simple. Press its tummy and watch it squeal like a man made out of bread dough.${prompt};
Tee hee!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You press your index finger into the doll's belly button.;
${color-alt: 15}The doll begins to twitch and shudder!;
Hehehe!;
This little device is known as “${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.”${prompt};
The doll has brought us closer together than two people are ever meant to be.${prompt};
Perhaps that's a tad over the top. But the doll is a symbol of your participation in Unity Concord, a system developed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Let me explain.${prompt};
Unity Concord brings together people of like mind to share wonderful experiences with each other...both on and off the battlefield.${prompt};
And you are now part of this wondrous organization.${prompt};
You know what would make me elated? If you were to choose a Unity leader. Go on, now.${prompt};
Hehe, I know your type! The Unity you really want to join is...mine. But I don't have one yet.${prompt};
I'll hold onto your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} until you're ready to decide. Waiting with...bated breath.${prompt};
How lovely that you came back! Here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, safe and sound.${prompt};

Hmm...${choice: 0}[Pieuje's/Ayame's/Invincible Shield's/Apururu's/Maat's/Aldo's/Jakoh Wahcondalo's/Naja Salaheem's/Flaviria's/Yoran-Oran's/Sylvie's] Unity, correct? That's where you want to stay until I can woo you over to mine?${prompt};
Now squeeze your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, close your eyes, and think pleasant thoughts of your new Unity leader.${prompt};
Did your introduction go well?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} really are fabulous creations, what with being able to converse over long distances.${prompt};
Yours can be used to talk with others belonging to the same Unity!${prompt};
...My heart aches knowing that you value that doll more than you do me.${prompt};
Hmph. That's okay. I won't keep you from talking with your friends.${prompt};
If you like them so much, why don't you select the chat settings from “Unity Info” from the “Unity” section of the “Status” submenu and let all your feelings out?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Is something bothering you?;
Thanks.;
Uh...sorry.${prompt};
No! I'm perfectly fine!${prompt};
Well, the only reason I helped you anyway is because I had to.${prompt};
Your false apologies will get you nowhere!${prompt};
Now go have fun with your Unity and leave me to wallow in peace.${prompt};
What do you want?;
Fine. Go to ${zone: 0[2]}. Just don't be surprised if I've found someone else by the time you're back.${prompt};
And you don't even have enough accolades! Ugh, what did I expect...${prompt};
Hey--don't forget that you can only exchange ${number: 0} more accolade${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] this week!${prompt};
Here's what your new piece of equipment'll look like.${prompt};
If you want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I'll need ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, and ${number: 3} Unity accolade${choice-plurality: 3}[/s].${prompt};
Don't expect it to be done right away. The artisan is busy and needs time to work.${prompt};
But hang on--you've already got a request pending for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Can't you be more patient!?${prompt};
I suppose this is what the new attribute will be like.${prompt};
This is what your equipment will be like if you increase its rank to the maximum.${prompt};
You'll need to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} along with your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. And don't even think about forgetting my fee of ${number: 2} accolade${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]!${prompt};
I also cannot accept your request unless you complete the Records of Eminence objective “${unknown: 0x01054082848080}” beforehand.${prompt};
To boost your item's rank, bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} that features an attribute along with some ${item-plural: 3[2]}. The more you bring, the higher its rank will rise.${prompt};
I am responsible for adding attributes to items as well as increasing their rank...${prompt};
H-hey, don't get the wrong idea! It's not like I learned how to do this just for you or anything!${prompt};
Wow, are you sure you want to waste your accolades on ${item-plural: 1[2]}? Hmph. That's your prerogative, but it'll cost you ${number: 0} accolade${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt};
And how many would you like? (1 to ${number: 0})${prompt};
${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]} will run you ${number: 0} accolade${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt};
That's fine. I didn't want your stinking accolades anyway.${prompt};
Does that mean...at least we...${prompt};
...Uh....never mind.;
Stop lollygagging and pick your Unity already!${prompt};
Everything should be in the clear. Go enjoy your new Unity and leave me here to rot.${prompt};
Sweet Goddess, would you make up your mind?${prompt};
More questions? Okay, let me take out this backbreakingly heavy guide I've been lugging around for days.${prompt};
First, you join a Unity of your choosing.${prompt};
Then you earn accolades by completing Records of Eminence objectives.${prompt};
Finally, you use those accolades to procure rewards.${prompt};
Hopefully that was simple enough for you to wrap your pea-sized head around.${prompt};
You want us to enhance your ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Our artisan requires a fee of ${number: 0} accolade${choice-plurality: 0}[/s]. Are you willing to cough it up?${prompt};
I'll make sure it gets safely to him. Try not to get killed in the meantime.${prompt};
Have you come back to torment me!?${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 1[2]} isn't ready yet. Shoo! Shoo!${prompt};
Yeah, yeah, your ${item-singular: 1[2]} is finally ready. I hope you choke on it.${prompt};
What do you want? Let me guess, you're looking to upgrade your ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
I'll need to charge you ${number: 0} accolade${choice-plurality: 0}[/s]. You're good for it, right?${prompt};
Here you go. I don't want to hear any complaints out of you.${prompt};
What's wrong with you? I don't have time for this nonsense!${prompt};
You forgot already!? You need to complete the Records of Eminence objective “${unknown: 0x01054082878080}” first!${prompt};
What's that? You want to use ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]} to store Reinforcement Points for your ${item-singular: 4[2]}?${prompt};
Okay, here you go. H-hey, I couldn't care less if this is for you or not!${prompt};
What's the matter with you? You're the one who came to me!${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
The crystal resonates deep within your soul!${unknown: 0x7F38C800};
Vana'diel...in the year 898?${prompt};
I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...${prompt};
Master, look at the orb.${prompt};
You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.${prompt};
This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.${prompt};
Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.${prompt};
Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.${prompt};
In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt};
Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.${prompt};
Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.${prompt};
But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...${prompt};
And I am unable to remain here in 884.${prompt};
My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.${prompt};
Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt};
But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.${prompt};
May your steps remain swift and true.${prompt};
Head for...the palace...${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.${prompt};
But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.${prompt};
I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.${prompt};
If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!${prompt};
Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!${prompt};
Master...forgive me.${prompt};
Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.${prompt};
I'm so hungry...${prompt};
Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?${prompt};
I'm here...${choice: 1}[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...${prompt};
Luzaf...I wish you were here...${prompt};
Please...help me...${prompt};
Razfahd must be stopped...${prompt};
Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...${prompt};
I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.${prompt};
I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.${prompt};
Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.${prompt};
The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt};
Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt};
Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt};
Old gods? New?${prompt};
No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt};
We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.${prompt};
And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.${prompt};
There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.${prompt};
Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt};
And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt};
Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt};
But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt};
For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt};
Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt};
Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt};
It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt};
I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt};
All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt};
An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt};
I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt};
Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt};
I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt};
When I fell before you...${prompt};
...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt};
I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt};
And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt};
This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt};
Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt};
Open your eyes and witness the truth!${prompt};
Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?${prompt};
Is this a dream?;
${selection-lines};
What else could it be?;
No. It's something more...${prompt};
Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt};
A keen eye, as always.${prompt};
The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt};
As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt};
I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt};
And those...${prompt};
...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt};
I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt};
Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt};
And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt};
You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt};
At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt};
Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt};
So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt};
One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt};
Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt};
False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...;
The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt};
Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt};
Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt};
Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”;
Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt};
No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt};
...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt};
You must not. You cannot.${prompt};
Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt};
Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt};
There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt};
You are the culmination of all your experiences.;
Even those who are gone still depend on you.;
${name-player}, this rhapsody is yours to sing.${wait-animation: 3};

Master--the orb.${prompt};
You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.${prompt};
Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.${prompt};
He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt};
I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?${prompt};
What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt};
We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.${prompt};
Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.${prompt};
And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...${prompt};
The future should have changed...${prompt};
...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.${prompt};
Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.${prompt};
And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.${prompt};
The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!${prompt};
Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?${prompt};
At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?${prompt};
Participate in the Pink Masquerade?;
${selection-lines};
Sounds like fun!;
I think I'll pass.${prompt};
A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!${prompt};
Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.${prompt};
All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.${prompt};
We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.${prompt};
Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.${prompt};
As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.${prompt};
Those whose outfits receive at least ${number: 0} points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.${prompt};
But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these “mannequins” for all to see!${prompt};
That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.${prompt};
Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!${prompt};
Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!${prompt};
Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.${prompt};
As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!${prompt};
The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.;
Do you have any questions?;
${selection-lines};
Who are the winning entrants?;
Tell me about the costume contest.;
What kind of sweets do you want?;
Tell me how entrants are judged.;
I'd like ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
None for now.${prompt};
The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.${prompt};
${choice: 1}[/First/Second/Third] place: ${entity: 0} - ${number: 2} pts.;
No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.;
I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Previous page.;
I'm done.;
Next page.${prompt};
The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.${prompt};
As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.${prompt};
Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.${prompt};
Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.${prompt};
In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.${prompt};
And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral...${wait-36: 3};
Ahem! Forget I said anything!${prompt};
Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.${prompt};
Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!${prompt};
Your score for this outfit is...${wait-36: 1};
${number: 0}!${prompt};
${choice: 1}[Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...];
Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!${prompt};
Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!${prompt};
Here is your splendid gift, as promised!${prompt};
I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?${prompt};
Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you ${choice: 1}[/first/second/third] place!${prompt};
Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.${prompt};
That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!${prompt};
As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.${prompt};
Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!${prompt};
(Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)${prompt};
(The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)${prompt};
(At least I'll be able to line my stomach with sugary goodness once this is over.)${prompt};

Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.${prompt};
To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.${prompt};
I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.${prompt};
Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.${prompt};
Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.${prompt};
Will you stay mum?;
${selection-lines};
Mum's the word.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.${prompt};
Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.${prompt};
Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.${prompt};
Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this “crystal storage,” if you will.${prompt};
It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.${prompt};
But I can store more than crystals alone. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and the like are also acceptable.${prompt};
My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.${prompt};
You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!${prompt};
You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.${prompt};
Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The ${name-npc} gives a sly smile.;
This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.${prompt};
If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.${prompt};
Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.${prompt};
It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.${prompt};
I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.${prompt};
You are now able to store crystals!;
Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?${prompt};
What would you like?;
${selection-lines};
Crystals returned to me.;
A bit of an explanation.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Which element?;
${selection-lines};
Never mind.;
How many would you like?;
${selection-lines};
None, actually.;
A specific number.;
As many you can fit.${prompt};
How many? (${number: 8} stored);
${number: 1} ${choice: 0}[/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal${choice-plurality: 1}[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Are you sure?;
Is this what you desire?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
“As many as you can fit!?”;
I-if you say so...${prompt};
Okay...;
Moogle Magic, ahoy!${prompt};
There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.${prompt};
Inquire about what?;
${selection-lines};
Your purpose.;
Storing crystals.;
Retrieving crystals.;
Who are you?;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.${prompt};
Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.${prompt};
You want me to hold onto these, kupo?${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Then let the magic begin!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.${prompt};
Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!${prompt};
You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} for a total of ${number: 2}.${prompt};
You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} for a total of ${number: 4}.${prompt};

You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} for a total of ${number: 4}.;
Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.${prompt};

Do you want to make the trade?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You don't have enough crafter points.${prompt};
These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.${prompt};
Deliverable Items;
${selection-lines};
I'm finished here.${prompt};
This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.${prompt};
By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.${prompt};
Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.${prompt};
The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.${prompt};
Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.${prompt};
Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.${prompt};
Please note that you can't use ${item-plural: 1[2]} in place of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.${prompt};
At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of ${number: 2} guild point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s].${prompt};
Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.${prompt};
Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).${prompt};
It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.${prompt};
Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.${prompt};
You receive ${number: 0} crafter point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and now have a total of ${number: 1} crafter point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]!${prompt};
We now have available ${item-plural: 0[2]} for the low cost of ${number: 1} gil per.${prompt};
I am willing to part with up to ${number: 2}.;
My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.${prompt};
What do you want to do?;

Obtain a kit.;

Greetings to you. Hm? What is this shield you are carrying?${prompt};
Ahh, now I see. You must have met with that woman who came from Adoulin.${prompt};
Yes, I have heard the tale of this shield. It can supposedly increase one's crafting ability, yes?${prompt};
Nothing would bring me more pleasure than for such a tale to be true.${prompt};
I assume she has also rated your technique as highly as I do. Yes, it is always nice to receive validation, especially from those outside of our own circle.${prompt};
Shall we begin? First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so please try not to forget it.${prompt};
Let me see... For the necessary ingredients, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
This particular item is used to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt};
I actually have some notes here on the issue of Craftsmanship. Allow me to go over them with you.${prompt};
You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt};
Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt};
In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt};
You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt};
That's all it says.${prompt};
Once you have increased the Craftsmanship, come show the shield to me and I'll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt};
Next, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I've entrusted them to Wolden-Bolden.${prompt};
I assume you're no stranger to making deliveries. That's basically what you will need to do here.${prompt};
Please speak to Wolden-Bolden if you need more details.${prompt};
That's it for the ingredients. I'd like to see the shield after it's upgraded. I'm quite curious to see what it's capable of.${prompt};
Don't tell me you forgot the recipe! Fine. Here it is again. Professionals really only need to hear these things once, you know.${prompt};
Yes, you really have come a long way and are capable of making all kinds of wonderful things. I'm sure this will be no different.${prompt};
Oh yes... This is exactly what I need to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
I can somewhat comprehend the technique to pour the soul of a craftsman into this shield and generate such a thing, but it is still impressive nonetheless.${prompt};
Oh, I'm not sure if this is related, but in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems to have reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I don't surmise it to be much of a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you might need to increase the Craftsmanship again if you ever need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is clearly just a hypothetical of course. I mean, you would have to lose the item in order to need to make another one and you're much too responsible to let that happen.${prompt};
Wait, are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I suppose it can't be helped. Here, I'll make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt};
You are better than this. Losing important ingredients is something I expect from an apprentice, not you.${prompt};
Ahh, I see you've made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a closer look?${prompt};
This is astonishing. The shape has changed, and I can feel a small surge of power emanating from it. Although, it is clearly still a work in progress.${prompt};
Yes, I remember her saying that you needed to craft multiple times before it would reach the level you want it to be.${prompt};
That reminds me, she wanted me to mark the shield when it was done. If I may?${prompt};
There, that should do it.${prompt};
Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.${prompt};
Oh, and please note that I often have deliveries for Wolden-Bolden. I hope you'll help me in my efforts to educate the more junior members of the guild.${prompt};
Oh, I have been expecting you. She said you might come asking about how to upgrade the shield.${prompt};
Allow me to tell you the recipe. This is important, so please try to remember it.${prompt};
Did you get all of that?${prompt};
Now, let me explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
You crafted while equipping the aspis before to increase its Craftsmanship, right? This is basically the same thing, as you will be equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} this time around.${prompt};
However, you will really need to pour your spirit into the shield this time. It seems rather difficult compared to the last one.${prompt};
Once the shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%, bring it to me and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt};
Next, in regards to the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}, I have left them with Wolden-Bolden.${prompt};
Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. For it, I have enlisted the help of the A.M.A.N. to prepare some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};
You will receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you complete them. Please refer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details.${prompt};
That covers the ingredients. I imagine it will take some time to gather them all, but I am positive that you can do it. Good luck.${prompt};
Well? Did you increase the shield's Craftsmanship?${prompt};
Excellent. I will create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you now.${prompt};
Here you go.${prompt};
Look what happened here... It seems creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} lowered the shield's Craftsmanship rating.${prompt};
It would be quite cumbersome to have to create another one, so please take care of it until you are ready to craft with it.${prompt};
Very well done! So this is what became of those ingredients. It is a shining example of absolute perfection!${prompt};
In addition, I am feeling a power emanating from the shield that was not present last time. I cannot wait to see what the next upgrade will bring!${prompt};
Now, I just need to mark the shield for you and we will be finished.${prompt};
There you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.${prompt};
How disappointing... Although, it does us no good to worry about it. You can have another try at completing the final objective.${prompt};
Welcome. Have you come to upgrade your shield? Very well, I shall explain the recipe to you...${prompt};
Oh, so you've already heard the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt};
I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};
Basically, I would like your help with some orders that were placed with our guild. I need you to deliver the products to the customers.${prompt};
However, you can't just take the items to them because we've been requested to make the products on site.${prompt};
Some materials and other items are exempt, but basically you need to make all of the items where the customer can see you or they won't be accepted.${prompt};
Do you think I could ask you to gather the materials needed to make the items?${prompt};
By the way, we have reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their items on a trial basis, including some you normally can't buy.${prompt};
Speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. Hopefully it will prove useful for you.${prompt};
Oh, you should keep in mind that you might not always be able to buy the items you are looking for.${prompt};
After you have completed all of the requests, I shall give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};
This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Diadonour at the watch tower in ${unknown: 0x01053782E48080}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Diadonour at the watch tower in ${unknown: 0x01053782E48080}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt};
Oh yes, you do not need to craft this particular item near the customer.${prompt};
Please report back to me once the delivery is finished.${prompt};
Hmm... Your current request is as follows...${prompt};
So, how is the request going?${prompt};
Everything okay?;
${selection-lines};
Everything's great!;
It could be better...${prompt};
Excellent! I expect nothing less than the best from you. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
Hm? You are not feeling well? Is this task really that demanding?${prompt};
Will you see this through?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do my best.;
I've had enough.${prompt};
I see... I am sorry to have placed such a burden on you. I shall look for another craftsman to take on this particular task for me.${prompt};
Yes, you should really try to get some rest. I can prepare another job for you after you are feeling better.${prompt};
Ahh, you are looking much better now. Just in time too, as I have a new job for you.${prompt};
It is good to see you again. I see you finished the delivery. Thank you for that.${prompt};
Oh! I see you have finished the last delivery. Thank you for all of your hard work.${prompt};
I always keep my word, so here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} as promised.${prompt};
If you ever lose them, you can trade guild points for a replacement.${prompt};
This process is almost like second nature to me now.${prompt};
So, this is what the shield looks like this time around...${prompt};
I am speechless. Would you consider letting me put it on display here in the guild?${prompt};
Hahaha... I am just joking of course. Our mutual friend seems to think that the next upgrade will unlock the shield's ultimate power. I wonder if she's right...${prompt};
Oh, before you go, I want you to have something. I think a craftsman of your ability will be able to use this crafting technique capably. Consider it a present from me for all of your hard work.${prompt};
Welcome. I see you have reached the final upgrade. I have managed to prepare the necessary materials for you.${prompt};
Allow me to explain how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt};
First, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
I have left them with Wolden-Bolden. In other words, you can obtain them by exchanging crafter points. How many do you have saved so far?${prompt};
You will also need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. For it, you will need to follow the same procedure as before, showing me your shield once its Craftsmanship has reached 100%.${prompt};
That covers the ingredients. It is exciting to know that you are so close to finishing this process. I am looking forward to seeing the end result.${prompt};
That reminds me, Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno is planning to use this, right? Please try not to lose it when making the delivery.${prompt};
Hm? Is something the matter? You look like you want to ask me something...${prompt};
Hmm... This item you mention sounds like the one a Tarutaru from Adoulin requested me to make.${prompt};
So, I apologize, but you are too late. I already sent it off to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt};
Perhaps you should return to Jeuno and see if it has been delivered yet?${prompt};
I have no idea how this happened... This is the emblem you were looking for, right? It seems it was just sitting on the shelf here in my shop.${prompt};
You need this for something? No problem. I originally made it for you anyway. Feel free to do with it as you wish.${prompt};
Would you look at this!${prompt};
It looks like you finally finished. It really is quite amazing! I like the way our guild's emblem looks on it too.${prompt};
I really put my heart and soul into making that emblem! It will serve as the perfect symbol of our guild when you equip the shield.${prompt};
Although it has nothing to do with you completing the shield, I have prepared a small gift for you. It is a new crafting technique.${prompt};
I know that you have the skill to make good use of it. I look forward to seeing you take on all-new challenges with it and that magnificent shield!${prompt};

${choice: 1}[Hi there!/Hello, friend!] I see you got letter I give to moogle.${prompt};
Happy 20th Vana'versary!${prompt};
I hope you ready to play Mandragora Mania Madness!${prompt};
Since this new game, would you like to check rules in manual?${prompt};
Read the manual?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
No thanks.${prompt};
Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.${prompt};
You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).${prompt};
The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.${prompt};
The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.${prompt};
However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.${prompt};
Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.${prompt};
If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.${prompt};
You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.${prompt};
Now, for an explanation on points.${prompt};
You receive points after the completion of each game.;
The points are tallied using units known as mandy.${prompt};
If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board.;
In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.${prompt};
Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).${prompt};
The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.${prompt};
Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).${prompt};
They are worth ${number: 0}x and ${number: 1}x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.${prompt};
The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.${prompt};
See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?${prompt};
You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt};
Can trade mandy for many goodies.${prompt};
Then I just give one piece of advice.${prompt};
You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt};
You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.${prompt};

It is recommended that you use “/assistj (/aj)” when posting in Japanese, and “/assiste (/ae)” when posting in English.${prompt};
You must meet one of the following conditions in order to post to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
1. You are a new player;
You may post messages from the moment you first set foot in Vana'diel.${prompt};
2. You are a returnee;
As a returning player, you may post messages upon logging in with a character that has not logged in for at least 48 days.${prompt};
3. You are a mentor;
You may post messages as long as you remain a mentor to other players.${prompt};
New players and returnees may post messages until they have been logged in for a total of 48 hours since first receiving their posting rights.${prompt};
"If you wish to check how long you can continue to post for, speak to an ${name-npc} and choose ""When do my posting rights expire?"" to see how much time you have left.${prompt}";
The Assist Channel can only be used in the following areas.${prompt};
Available areas:;
${unknown: 0x01053782C68080}, and your Mog House (Rent-a-Room).${prompt};
You cannot post or read messages outside of the areas listed above.${prompt};
Even in areas where messages are allowed, you cannot post consecutive messages.;
Please wait a while after posting a message.${prompt};
Mentor messages are accompanied by a flag (${icon: 0xEFEF}/) marker.;
This marker indicates the mentor's reliability (Mentor Class) and experience as an adventurer (Mastery Rank).${prompt};
As a mentor's Mentor Class increases, the color and shape of the marker will change: ${icon: 0xEFEF}/ > ${icon: 0xEFEF}9 > ${icon: 0xEFEF}C${prompt};
A ${icon: 0xEFEF}C marker is a sign that the mentor has earned the highest levels of trust from other adventurers.${prompt};
The number affixed to the marker is the mentor's Mastery Rank, and indicates how experienced the mentor is as an adventurer.${prompt};
The higher the number, the more experienced the mentor is.${prompt};
You can check your own Mastery Rank even if you do not serve as a mentor, so feel free to take a look every now and then if you are curious.${prompt};
You can check your Mastery Rank by going to Main Menu > Status > Profile.${prompt};
If you wish to speak directly to a mentor, you can search for mentors by going to Main Menu > Help Desk > Mentor Search.${prompt};
The “Thumbs Up” feature enables you to let mentors know when their comments proved to be especially helpful.${prompt};
Mentors who earn lots of “Thumbs Up” replies from other adventurers will see their Mentor Class increase.${prompt};
Remember to give a “Thumbs Up” to any mentor you feel helped you out or taught you something useful.${prompt};
A “Warning” is a feature that can only be used by mentors.${prompt};
Please use this feature when a post's contents are insufficient or otherwise may be construed as harassment.${prompt};
To send a “Thumbs Up” or “Warning” to another player, open the Chat Log Window and move the cursor over the relevant message and press the confirm button (Enter key) to bring up the evaluation menu.${prompt};
Evaluations can be made for 10 minutes following the designated player's latest post to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
You may send up to one “Thumbs Up” and one “Warning” per day (Earth time).${prompt};
The “Mute” feature places restrictions on your ability to post, meaning that other players will be unable to see the messages you post to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
Please refrain from posting unsuitable content so that the veteran adventurers are not forced to mute you.${prompt};
Mute status can be removed by players that have the necessary Mute List access rights, or it will be removed automatically 24 hours (Earth time) after the mute status was enabled.${prompt};
You are free to post messages to the Assist Channel until you decide to stop serving as a mentor.${prompt};

Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt};
Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt};
At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt};
"There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is ""Random.""${prompt}";
This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt};
The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt};
You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt};
The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt};
Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt};
From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt};
For example, if you select Area 1,${wait-36: 4}one mandragora will move to Area 2${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 3,${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 4.${prompt};
Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt};
You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt};
You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt};
If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt};
The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt};
This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt};
However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt};
Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt};
Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt};
Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).${prompt};
Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).${prompt};
The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.${prompt};
The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.${prompt};
The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.${prompt};
