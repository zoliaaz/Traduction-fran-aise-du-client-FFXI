If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} and have a high enough job level.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo for ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.${prompt};
If you still want one, it will cost you ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
Do you wish to rent a chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I do.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
You don't have enough gil.${prompt};
You cannot obtain the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Come back after sorting your inventory.${prompt};
Would you be so kind as to deliver her to ${choice: 3}[the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?${prompt};
Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo.;
First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle.;
We charge a service fee of ${number: 0} Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of.;
My records indicate that you currently have ${number: 1} Allied Notes.${prompt};
Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes.;
Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?${prompt};
I am a traveling minstrel. The lands I have walked are many, as are the memories I have shared with my traveling brethren.${prompt};
A minstrel from Windurst, eh? Yes, I know a Jatan-Paratan, as a matter of fact. Long ago we undertook a perilous journey together.${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I recently had the good fortune to visit Windurst, and ran into my old friend in a tavern there.${prompt};
As always, his music talents are quite formidable. His performance there moved me deeply.${prompt};
But to say goodbye in such a plain setting would hardly fit such a maestro, so I bade him to visit glorious Jeuno.${prompt};
Oddly, though, he was far too attached to his current surroundings. And so he declined.${prompt};
What? You say the great Jatan-Paratan is worried? I think I know what troubles him. Now may be my chance to beckon him to Jeuno!${prompt};
Please, I need your help. Find ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and present it to him. Seeing that may rekindle the enthusiasm of his younger days.${prompt};
The sounds of Jatan-Paratan's masterful flute... They would truly belong in Jeuno, the capital of music!${prompt};
Please, find ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and give it to him. Seeing that may rekindle the enthusiasm of his younger days.${prompt};
Oh, I see... So that was what was troubling Jatan-Paratan.${prompt};
Obviously I was naive. Perhaps it would behoove me to rethink the true meaning of music. A thousand thanks, traveler!${prompt};
Step right this way to entaru your Rent-a-Roomie!${prompt};
Say, I can reserve a Rent-a-Roomie for you. All your stuff will be taken from your Moggie-Woggie House and brought here!${prompt};
Do you want to move to Jeuno?;
${selection-lines};
Right away.;
Not now, thanks.${prompt};
Very well. I've completed the necessary procedure-wedures! Make yourself at home in your home away from home! Hehehe!${prompt};
Oh, okay. Fine! Be that way!${prompt};
Enter the residential area?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
${prompt};

I found ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

Master, Master!;
I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};
Master! What ${choice: 7}[an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there!;
Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...${prompt};
We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!${prompt};
Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo?;
Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!${prompt};
We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo!;
If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your ${item-singular: 3[2]}, when this ${item-singular: 4[2]} just popped out!;
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Look at what I found while cleaning out the ${item-singular: 3[2]}: ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}!${prompt};

ボタン押すと次へ進みます${prompt};
It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;
Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!${prompt};

To complete my research, I'm recruiting strong, reliable adventurers to venture outaru and gather data on my behalf.${prompt};
What kind of data, you ask?${prompt};
Hold on...justaru a second...;
This here, is...${prompt};
The miraculous ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}～!;
So, like I said, your role in my promotion exam--er...research, is to collect data.${prompt};
All you have to do is go and clobber all of the monstarus whose names have been recorded onto the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, or “Dale,” as I like to call him.${prompt};
Data of your encounter with each creature will be automatically recorded by Dale. So all that's leftaru to do is bring him back to me! Easy peasy, just like a strolly-woll through Windurst Waters!${prompt};
With that data, fame and fortune will finally be...${prompt};
Uh...I meantaru, peace and prosperity will be guaranteed for all of Vana'diel!${prompt};
Of course, I'm not asking you to work for free. You'll be well rewarded aftaru completing the task. So, how about it?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Reward? Count me in!;
Nah, it's not worth the effort.${prompt};
Excellent! I knew I could count on--what!?;
Hmph...then you can go and getaru thrown off a chocobo for all I care! A dozen adventurers like you aren't worth a single copper ingot anyway!${prompt};
Excellent!;
Why don't we first take a look at the list of monstarus?${prompt};
You can see the listy-wist of monstarus by examining Dale. The ones you've already defeated will have crosses after their names.${prompt};
If you wantaru to know more about each of the creatures, just ask me, okay?${prompt};

I'll let you hold on to Dale for the duration of your task. Bring him back here any time you want to check the listaru, okay?${prompt};
Thank you for your cooperation!;
Hey! How goes my promotion exam--uh...the collection of data?${prompt};
May I see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Certainly.;
Nothing to see here.${prompt};
You still have a long way to go before I can getaru that promot--uh, before the people of Vana'diel can know true peace and prosperity. Yes, that's it...peace and prosperity!;
${prompt};
Looks like you've made some progress. Keep up the good work, and my promot--uh, the land will be rid of the pesky monstarus for good!${prompt};
Hey, the list shows you've taken care of quite a few monstarus! The thought of my promot--uh, a brighter future for the land drawing nearer makes my heart racey-wace! Yes it does!${prompt};
Wowsers! My promotion is just around the corn--uh, what I meantaru to say is, data collection is almost over! Exciting times indeed!${prompt};
And that's the latest report from Dale.;
Thank you for your continued cooperation!;
<Gasp!>;
The...the data. It...it's finally complete!${prompt};
I knew a sorry bunch of monstarus like that would be a cakewalk for a bruiser like you!${prompt};
But, wow!;
I never thought passing the promotion exam could be this easy! I truly-wuly am a genius!${prompt};
Now, let me prepare your reward for services rendered...${prompt};
(Hohoho, a measly-weasly price to pay for passing the exam.)${prompt};
(My promotion at the Orastery is guaranteed!)${prompt};
(But why stop there? At this rate, joining the ranks of the Patriarchs doesn't even seem crazy-wazy anymore! Mwahahaha!)${prompt};
Now, I justaru need to lock down the battle data...${prompt};
Hrm?;
Doesn't seem to be working for some reason...${prompt};
Uwaaah!;
It's...alive!?;
<Beep!>;
Surveillance subject: Rakuru-Rakoru....${prompt};
(Th...that voice! It can't be!);
<Beep!>;
My pitiful little fraudster, did you think you'd get away?;
How do I punish thee? Let me count the ways!;
Ohohohohoho!${prompt};
Uwaaaaaah!!!;
M-my promotion...my dreamy-weam of becoming leading citizen...all gone...;
<Sniff, sob>;
<Mumble, mumble>;
Those fools...how d-d-dare they suspect me--the foremost authority on the research of mystical artifacts--of theft!?${prompt};
...!?;
That w-w-weapon which you bear--it's the very object I've been searching for! Ahee hee hee...${prompt};
Listen to me. Immense p-p-power is hidden within your ${item-singular: 8[2]}.${prompt};
There's a trick to unlocking that power--a t-t-trick which I happen to know. Ahee hee hee...${prompt};
Surely, you're interested in tapping into that power? It'll cost you not a single g-g-gil--I just need to be permitted to examine it, that's all.${prompt};
Let him examine your weapon?;
${selection-lines};
More power? Gimme, gimme!;
He's got shifty eyes...${prompt};
...;
You're no different from those fools who suspect me! G-g-get out of my sight!${prompt};
Yes, yes, trust is good for the soul.;
Now, if you'll allow me, hee hee hee...${prompt};
The deed is done. The rest is up to you to wield it as you have thus far.${prompt};
An invisible, mystical energy resides within your weapon. I would explain the n-n-nature of this energy in more detail, but I fear it is beyond the comprehension of a layperson.${prompt};
Wh-what? You doubt my kn-kn-knowledge on the subject!?${prompt};
Hmph. I won't deny that research is still ongoing. I do know, however, that those who venture deeper within the Nyzul Isle develop g-g-greater affinity with these artifacts.${prompt};
So indeed, if you've already come to be in p-p-possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you can expect stupendous results.${prompt};
Note, though, that I have merely awakened your weapon from its long s-s-slumber. You must, through usage, accumulate said energy to the point of saturation.${prompt};
With that accomplished, a m-m-most extraordinary evolution will take place.${prompt};
When that happens, bring the weapon to me. I promise it'll be a profitable v-v-venture for you...and yours truly, too. Ahee hee hee...${prompt};
When you sense a ch-ch-change has occurred within your weapon, bring it to me. I promise you won't regret it.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I sense only a mote of energy p-p-present. You still have a long way to go, it seems.${prompt};
Aaah, yes...;
I can feel a marked increase in energy compared to when I first held it. Keep up the good w-w-work, hee hee hee...${prompt};
Goodness g-g-gracious me!;
The energy within is threatening to b-b-burst forth! It won't be long now, hee hee hee...${prompt};
You've done it! Energy is overflowing as though the floodg-g-gates have burst open!${prompt};
Using the surplus energy from the ${item-singular: 8[2]}, I will imbue a new power within you. This might sting a little, hee hee hee!${prompt};Tu l'as fait ! L'énergie déborde comme si les écluses s'étaient ouvertes !${prompt}
Each step brings me closer to being reinstated to my post in the Imperial Court. Ahee hee hee...${prompt};En utilisant le surplus d’énergie du ${item-singular: 8[2]}, je vais insuffler un nouveau pouvoir en toi. Cela pourrait piquer un peu, hihi !${prompt}

Hi. I'm Aldo, head of Tenshodo. We deal in things you can't buy anywhere else. Take your time and have a look around.${prompt};Il vous reste ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[signature/signatures].${prompt}
So you're the new diplomatic attaché. What, you've got a secret message from the archduke? Well, let me see it.${prompt};Salut. Je suis Aldo, le chef de la Tenshodo. Nous traitons des choses que vous ne pouvez trouver nulle part ailleurs. Prenez votre temps et regardez autour de vous.${prompt}
I see. Thanks for getting this to me. It says I'm supposed to tell you about magicite.${prompt};Alors, vous êtes le nouveau attaché diplomatique. Quoi, vous avez un message secret de l'archiduc ? Bon, laissez-moi voir ça.${prompt}
Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. But those places are thick with beastmen, and those beastmen are quite cunning.${prompt};Je vois. Merci de me l'avoir apporté. Ça dit que je suis censé vous parler du magicite.${prompt}
You'll need this to get inside Beadeaux.${prompt};La magicite se trouve au fin fond du château d'Oztroja, de Davoi et de Beadeaux. Mais ces endroits grouillent de bêtes, et ces bêtes sont plutôt rusées.${prompt}
Aldo...${prompt};Vous aurez besoin de ceci pour entrer dans Beadeaux.${prompt}
What is it, Verena? Can't you see I have a guest?${prompt};
I know. That's what it's about.${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est, Verena ? Ne vois-tu pas que j'ai un invité ?${prompt}
I heard that the archduke has made a statement...${prompt};Je sais. C'est à propos de ça.${prompt}
He's ordered all beastmen out of Jeuno. He must not think it's safe to have them around anymore.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que l'archiduc a fait une déclaration...${prompt}
What? I think those creeps in the palace are a lot worse than any beastmen we have here!${prompt};Il a ordonné à toutes les bêtes de Jeuno de partir. Il doit penser que ce n'est plus sûr de les avoir ici.${prompt}
It's like they're wearing masks...you can't tell what they're thinking. And their eyes are like cold stones. You're not gonna follow that order, are you?${prompt};Quoi ? Je pense que ces idiots dans le palais sont bien pires que n'importe quelle bête que nous avons ici !${prompt}
Well, I know how you feel, but with beastmen on the rampage out there, you can't blame people for feeling jittery about the ones in here.${prompt};C'est comme s'ils portaient des masques... on ne peut pas savoir ce qu'ils pensent. Et leurs yeux sont comme des pierres froides. Tu ne vas pas suivre cet ordre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
You've heard about all that, haven't you?${prompt};Eh bien, je comprends ce que tu ressens, mais avec les bêtes qui font des ravages là-bas, on ne peut pas blâmer les gens de se sentir nerveux à propos de celles qui sont ici.${prompt}
Yeah, I've heard. But the beastmen in town haven't ever hurt anybody!${prompt};Tu as entendu parler de tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I know that, Verena... But I don't think the average Jeunoan would agree.${prompt};Oui, j'ai entendu. Mais les bêtes en ville n'ont jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
No...${prompt};Je le sais, Verena... Mais je ne pense pas que le Jeunoan moyen serait d'accord.${prompt}
Maybe it's the wise thing to do. You know, taking action before things get out of hand.${prompt};Non...${prompt}
Well, I'll see if I can think up a better alternative. Don't worry. I'd be the last guy to chase them out of town.${prompt};Peut-être que c'est la chose sage à faire. Vous savez, agir avant que les choses ne dégénèrent.${prompt}
Okay. You promised, remember!${prompt};Eh bien, je verrai si je peux penser à une meilleure alternative. Ne vous inquiétez pas. Je serais le dernier à les chasser de la ville.${prompt}
Verena...${prompt};D'accord. Vous avez promis, souvenez-vous-en !${prompt}
Fickie!${prompt};
Oh!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};Fickie !${prompt}
Fickie... Are you all right?${prompt};Oh !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}
That's a weird thing to ask. I'm always all right. How about you? You look pale!${prompt};Fickie... Ça va ?${prompt}
Oh, um... No. No, I'm fine.${prompt};C'est bizarre de poser cette question. Je vais toujours bien. Et vous ? Vous avez l'air pâle !${prompt}
Oh, all right. Well, let's get going!${prompt};Oh, euh... Non. Non, ça va.${prompt}
Um, okay.${prompt};Oh, très bien. Eh bien, allons-y !${prompt}
Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. Those places are thick with murderous beastmen, and their traps are cunning.${prompt};Euh, d'accord.${prompt}
There's not a rumor that doesn't find its way to Jeuno. I bet you can find what you need from other adventurers. May your strength never falter!${prompt};La magicite se trouve au fin fond du château d'Oztroja, de Davoi et de Beadeaux. Ces endroits sont infestés de bêtes meurtrières, et leurs pièges sont rusés.${prompt}
What? You say the beastmen might be plotting something else? Yeah, it wouldn't be like them to just give up.${prompt};Aucune rumeur n'échappe à Jeuno. Je parie que vous pouvez trouver ce dont vous avez besoin auprès d'autres aventuriers. Que votre force ne défaille jamais !${prompt}
I don't want anything to do with beastmen anymore. I bet the old Goblin Muckvix knows more, but you'd have to ask him yourself.${prompt};Quoi ? Vous dites que les bêtes pourraient comploter quelque chose d'autre ? Ouais, ça ne serait pas dans leurs habitudes de simplement abandonner.${prompt}
Verena's really worried about Fickblix. Better not mention beastmen around her.${prompt};Je ne veux plus avoir affaire aux bêtes. Je parie que le vieux Goblin Muckvix en sait plus, mais vous devrez lui demander vous-même.${prompt}
I wonder who's worse, us or them? Fickie's never done anything bad at all.${prompt};Verena est vraiment inquiète pour Fickblix. Mieux vaut ne pas mentionner les bêtes en sa présence.${prompt}
Just 'cause they're not human doesn't mean we should hate them. Even a kid like Fickie gets treated like dirt.${prompt};Je me demande qui est pire, nous ou eux ? Fickie n'a jamais fait de mal à personne.${prompt}
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I can't help anybody. I'm sorry.${prompt};Juste parce qu'ils ne sont pas humains ne veut pas dire que nous devrions les détester. Même un enfant comme Fickie est traité comme de la saleté.${prompt}
What? Fickie's seeds started to grow? Hey, what's that gotta do with me, huh?${prompt};Je ne sais plus ce qui est juste ou faux. Je ne peux aider personne. Je suis désolé.${prompt}
'Course I don't like war. But that ain't the same thing.${prompt};Quoi ? Les graines de Fickie ont commencé à pousser ? Hé, qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec moi, hein ?${prompt}
Hey, I'm a beastie. I ain't tellin' you zilch if it'd hurt my peoples.${prompt};Bien sûr que j’aime pas la guerre. Mais ça veut pas dire la même chose.${prompt}
So, Fickblix's seeds started to sprout...${prompt};Hé, je suis une bestiole. Je vous dis rien si ça blesse mes gens.${prompt}
Aldo, I...${prompt};Alors, les graines de Fickblix ont commencé à germer...${prompt}
Verena, I heard your flowers started to sprout. I bet all you kids gave it lots of water. That kind of seed doesn't take root that easily.${prompt};Aldo, je...${prompt}
Maybe everything you and Fickblix acomplished really did mean something.${prompt};Verena, j'ai entendu dire que vos fleurs ont commencé à pousser. Je parie que vous les avez arrosées généreusement, tous les enfants. Ce genre de graine ne prend pas racine si facilement.${prompt}
Recently I... I haven't been watering it. I thought of nothing but myself. I'm so sorry, Fickie.${prompt};Peut-être que tout ce que vous et Fickblix avez accompli signifie vraiment quelque chose.${prompt}
Yeah, maybe it's not a question of what's right and what's wrong.${prompt};Récemment, je... Je ne l'ai pas arrosé. Je n'ai pensé qu'à moi-même. Je suis tellement désolé, Fickie.${prompt}
Nothing would be better than averting another conflict... For us, and for them.${prompt};Oui, peut-être que ce n'est pas une question de ce qui est bien et ce qui est mal.${prompt}
All right! I don't know what we can do, but I'll help. Fickie would never forgive us if we just stood silent.${prompt};Rien ne serait mieux que d'éviter un autre conflit... Pour nous, et pour eux.${prompt}
That's right! The least we can do is try.${prompt};D'accord ! Je ne sais pas ce que nous pouvons faire, mais j'aiderai. Fickie ne nous pardonnerait jamais si nous restions silencieux.${prompt}
But I don't know if we can find out what their little group is up to.${prompt};C'est vrai ! Le moins que nous puissions faire, c'est essayer.${prompt}
I guess we could ask Muckvix.${prompt};Mais je ne sais pas si nous pouvons découvrir ce que leur petit groupe manigance.${prompt}
But would he help? He always tries to stay out of these racial matters.${prompt};Je suppose que nous pourrions demander à Muckvix.${prompt}
And if he told us anything, he'd be betraying his own kind.${prompt};Mais est-ce qu'il aiderait ? Il essaie toujours de rester en dehors de ces affaires raciales.${prompt}
Yeah, I know. But there's nothing else we can do. ${name-player}, would you mind asking Muckvix? We'll head there later.${prompt};Et s'il nous disait quelque chose, il trahirait les siens.${prompt}
Hey, I ain't got nuttin' to say to ya. Scram.${prompt};Ouais, je sais. Mais il n'y a rien d'autre que nous puissions faire. ${name-player}, est-ce que ça vous dérangerait de demander à Muckvix ? Nous irons là-bas plus tard.${prompt}
We need your help, too, Muckvix.${prompt};Hé, j'ai rien à vous dire. Dégagez.${prompt}
Oh, so you're in this too, huh? Whaddaya tryin' to pull here?${prompt};Nous avons aussi besoin de votre aide, Muckvix.${prompt}
Please, Muck. You're our only hope. Jeuno--no, the entire world is in danger unless you tell us.${prompt};Oh, donc vous êtes là-dedans aussi, hein ? Qu'est-ce que vous essayez de faire ?${prompt}
Hey, I've been livin' here for ages, but when it comes down to it, I'm just a beastie, ain't I?${prompt};S'il te plaît, Muck. Tu es notre seul espoir. Jeuno - non, le monde entier est en danger à moins que tu ne nous dises.${prompt}
You ain't gonna get nuttin' outta me. See, we beasties are all brudders.${prompt};Hé, je vis ici depuis des lustres, mais quand ça compte vraiment, je ne suis qu'une bestiole, pas vrai ?${prompt}
Muck, you don't think of us as your own, but those kids and I helped Fickie's seeds grow... To us, people and beastmen are the same. We're all one and the same!${prompt};Vous n'allez rien obtenir de moi. Voyez-vous, nous les bestioles, nous sommes tous frères.${prompt}
And now, the chance for peace is in danger. Please, Muck, tell us!${prompt};Muck, tu ne nous considères pas comme les tiens, mais ces enfants et moi avons aidé les graines de Fickie à pousser... Pour nous, les gens et les bêtes sont les mêmes. Nous sommes tous un et le même !${prompt}
Chance for peace, huh? Aw, that Fickie... What would he do if he was here?${prompt};Et maintenant, la chance pour la paix est en danger. S'il te plaît, Muck, dis-nous !${prompt}
Aw, what the hell. But just this once! And only 'cause I owe your father. May my peoples forgive me...${prompt};La chance pour la paix, hein ? Oh, ce Fickie... Que ferait-il s'il était ici ?${prompt}
Okay, so the crew you're lookin' for's always been kinda cold to us.${prompt};Oh, bon sang. Mais juste cette fois ! Et seulement parce que je dois ça à ton père. Que mes gens me pardonnent...${prompt}
They're just a bunch of tough guys, but sometimes they go buck wild. I heard they're growin' into a big mob, so they must be up to somethin'!${prompt};D'accord, donc l'équipage que vous cherchez a toujours été un peu froid envers nous.${prompt}
Try lookin' around the Eldieme Necropolis. I heard the bums who left Davoi are layin' low there. And I ain't gonna say nuttin' more!${prompt};Ce ne sont que des durs à cuire, mais parfois ils deviennent fous. J'ai entendu dire qu'ils devenaient une grande bande, donc ils doivent être en train de préparer quelque chose !${prompt}
Thanks, Muck!${prompt};Essayez de regarder autour du Nécropole d'Eldieme. J'ai entendu dire que les clochards qui ont quitté Davoi se cachent là-bas. Et je ne vais pas en dire plus !${prompt}
Muckvix, thanks a million.${prompt};Merci, Muck !${prompt}
I am Zauko. I patrol Lower Jeuno.${prompt};Muckvix, mille mercis.${prompt}
We guards need more than muscle. We need the residents' trust.${prompt};Je suis Zauko. Je patrouille dans le Bas-Jeuno.${prompt}
Come see me if you're ever in trouble.${prompt};Nous, les gardes, avons besoin de plus que de la force. Nous avons besoin de la confiance des résidents.${prompt}

Take the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?;Qu'en dites-vous ? Vous pouvez toujours le rendre quand vous en aurez assez d'entendre l'annonce. Allez-y, prenez-le.${prompt}
${selection-lines};
Sure, why not?;
No thanks.${prompt};
That's the spirit. Can never have enough volunteers ready to keep the streets of Jeuno out of the dark.${prompt};
I see...;
Well, come back if you change your mind.;
Can never have enough volunteers ready to keep the streets of Jeuno out of the dark.${prompt};
So what do you think of the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?;
Pretty handy, huh?${prompt};
I think I'll...;
${selection-lines};
...hang on to it.;
...give it back now.${prompt};
Sure, no problem.;
Be sure to lend a hand when the sun goes down.${prompt};
Well, I hate to lose one of my volunteers.;
Speak to me again if you ever miss lamp-lighting duty.${prompt};
You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Darkness falls soon. It's time to light the lamps. Maybe you could help? I could always use a hand.${prompt};Vous rendez le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Soon darkness falls. It's time to light the lamps. Do you want to help me again?${prompt};La nuit tombe bientôt. Il est temps d'allumer les lampes. Peut-être pourriez-vous aider ? J'aurais toujours besoin d'un coup de main.${prompt}
Will you help out?;Bientôt la nuit tombe. Il est temps d'allumer les lampes. Voulez-vous m'aider à nouveau ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allez-vous aider ?
Of course.;
No, not now.${prompt};Bien sûr.
Don't worry. It's easy. See the twelve lamps on the sea side? Just light them for me.${prompt};Non, pas maintenant.${prompt}
It's no big task, but seeing the streets lit up at night brings warmth to my heart.${prompt};Ne vous inquiétez pas. C'est facile. Voyez les douze lampes du côté de la mer ? Il vous suffit de les allumer pour moi.${prompt}
Heh. Poetic, isn't it? Well, you better get started. Try to finish before one in the morning.${prompt};Ce n'est pas une grande tâche, mais voir les rues éclairées la nuit réchauffe mon cœur.${prompt}
Light the twelve lamps facing the ocean. I know you've done it before, but try to finish by one in the morning.${prompt};Heh. Poétique, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous feriez mieux de commencer. Essayez de finir avant une heure du matin.${prompt}
Oh? It's not hard. Come back if you change your mind.${prompt};Allumez les douze lampes qui font face à l'océan. Je sais que vous l'avez déjà fait, mais essayez de finir avant une heure du matin.${prompt}
Sorry. I already have a helper tonight. Maybe tomorrow.${prompt};Oh ? Ce n'est pas difficile. Revenez si vous changez d'avis.${prompt}
It's too early. Lights on at nine o'clock.${prompt};Désolé. J'ai déjà un assistant ce soir. Peut-être demain.${prompt}
Now you can begin. Do your best to finish by one o'clock. Thank you for your cooperation.${prompt};Il est trop tôt. Les lumières s'allument à neuf heures.${prompt}
Good work. I can't pay you, but I hope you found the experience rewarding.${prompt};Maintenant, vous pouvez commencer. Faites de votre mieux pour terminer avant une heure du matin. Merci pour votre coopération.${prompt}
Good work. It's rewarding each and every time, isn't it? You know I can't pay you, but I'm always glad to see people come back.${prompt};Bon travail. Je ne peux pas vous payer, mais j'espère que vous avez trouvé l'expérience enrichissante.${prompt}
Next time you come to Jeuno, think of the special evening when you gave light to its streets.${prompt};Bon travail. C'est toujours gratifiant, n'est-ce pas ? Vous savez que je ne peux pas vous payer, mais je suis toujours heureux de voir les gens revenir.${prompt}
And if the lamps happen to be lit then, it means that others are doing their best for Jeuno. You'd make me happy if you remember that.${prompt};La prochaine fois que vous viendrez à Jeuno, pensez à cette soirée spéciale où vous avez illuminé ses rues.${prompt}
I am disappointed. Stay sharp next time.${prompt};Et si les lampes sont allumées alors, cela signifie que d'autres font de leur mieux pour Jeuno. Cela me ferait plaisir que vous vous en souveniez.${prompt}
Ahh, there's nothing like city streets lit up at night.${prompt};Je suis déçu. Soyez plus attentif la prochaine fois.${prompt}
The lamps were lit by ${entity: 0} today. If you happen to run across the person who took time out to bring light to our city, don't forget to say a word of thanks.${prompt};Ahh, rien de tel que les rues de la ville éclairées la nuit.${prompt}
Sorry. I'm busy.${prompt};Les lampes ont été allumées par ${entity: 0} aujourd’hui. Si vous croisez la personne qui a pris le temps d’apporter de la lumière à notre ville, n’oubliez pas de lui dire merci.${prompt}
It seems too early to light the lamps.${prompt};Désolé, je suis occupé.${prompt}
Light the lamp?;Il semble trop tôt pour allumer les lampes.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allumer la lampe ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
You light the lamp.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
All the lamps are lit.${prompt};Vous allumez la lampe.${prompt}
You have ${number: 0} more ${choice-plurality: 0}[lamp/lamps] to go.${prompt};Toutes les lampes sont allumées.${prompt}
The lamp is already lit.${prompt};Il vous reste ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[lampe/lampes] à allumer.${prompt}
The lamp is already lit.${prompt};La lampe est déjà allumée.${prompt}
The lamp is lit.${prompt};La lampe est déjà allumée.${prompt}
You examine the lamp. It seems that it must be lit manually.${prompt};La lampe est allumée.${prompt}
It is too early to light it. You must wait until nine o'clock.${prompt};Vous examinez la lampe. Il semble qu'elle doit être allumée manuellement.${prompt}
You have failed to light all the lamps in time.${prompt};Il est trop tôt pour l'allumer. Vous devez attendre neuf heures.${prompt}
Zauko is recruiting an adventurer to light the lamps.${prompt};Vous n'avez pas réussi à allumer toutes les lampes à temps.${prompt}
What? They're going to tear down the clock tower? Not if I can help it. What could they be thinking?${prompt};Zauko recrute un aventurier pour allumer les lampes.${prompt}
Damn the politicians! Of course I'll sign.${prompt};Quoi ? Ils vont démolir la tour de l'horloge ? Pas si je peux l'empêcher. Que peuvent-ils bien penser ?${prompt}
Good luck with those signatures!${prompt};Maudits politiciens ! Bien sûr que je vais signer.${prompt}
Hm? Oh, I thought you were Two. He should be back any minutaru...${prompt};Bonne chance pour ces signatures !${prompt}
Two should be back soon. He's so handy-dandy!${prompt};Hm ? Oh, je pensais que tu étais Two. Il devrait revenir d'une minutaru...${prompt}
He should show up any minute now.${prompt};Two devrait revenir bientôt. Il est si pratique !${prompt}
HeLLo. I aM★hOmE.${prompt};Il devrait arriver d'une minute à l'autre.${prompt}
EgGs, ★caRroTs, cOrrEct? HeRe★chaNge.${prompt};BoNjOuR. jE sUiS★rEnTrÉ.$ {prompt}
Why thank you, Two. You're an angel. Unlike someone else I know.${prompt};OeUfS, ★cArOtTes, cOrReCt? IcI★cHaNgEr.${prompt}
I heard that! Anyway, Two... I want you to deliver this letter.${prompt};Merci beaucoup, Two. Tu es un ange. Contrairement à quelqu'un d'autre que je connais.${prompt}
I wOuLd★be hAppY tO.${prompt};J'ai entendu ça ! Quoi qu'il en soit, Two... Je veux que tu livres cette lettre.${prompt}
Panta-Putta! Deliver it yourself!${prompt};Je sEraIs★HeUreUx dE.${prompt}
No★iT aLl★riGht. I hAppY★to SeRve. I★lEaVe noW.${prompt};Panta-Putta ! Livrez-la vous-même !${prompt}
Well, isn't he something! Maybe we can rinse his gears in oil and make Panta drink it! How 'bout that?${prompt};Non★c'eSt bOn★. jE sUiS★hEuReUx★dE sErViR. jE★PaRt mAiNtEnAnT.${prompt}
Eww! I'd get sick!${prompt};Eh bien, n'est-il pas quelque chose ! Peut-être pouvons-nous rincer ses engrenages dans de l'huile et faire boire ça à Panta ! Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?${prompt}
Hahoho!${prompt};Beurk ! Je serais malade !${prompt}
You're all bark and no bite.${prompt};Hahoho !${prompt}
Whatever-wever!${prompt};Vous aboyez beaucoup mais vous ne mordez pas.${prompt}
Well, I'd best start fixing something. Today we're having Tarutaru soup. I have to boil it in ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}! It's good food, I say!${prompt};Peu importe !${prompt}
But I don't see it anywhere! Oh, dear... Where could it be?${prompt};
Dangit, I need that soup pot if I'm going to beat him. How can I get another-wother one...${prompt};
I salvaged that Cardian when Panta was just a cub. We didn't think he'd make it, but somehow he started up.${prompt};
Both me and my wife used to work back then, doing all we could to make ends meet. But how could we take care of little Panta with both of us slavey-waving away?${prompt};
That's where Two came in. We were so grateful for his help. He's such an earnest Cardian. We don't know what we'd do without him.${prompt};
Say, there's a favor I want to ask you. Could you bring me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}?${prompt};
One of my schoolmates has one. And I want one, too! Please? Pretty-witty please!${prompt};
Will you help Panta-Putta?;
${selection-lines};
Very well.;
No.${prompt};
Yippee! Thanks a megaton! Oh, but don't tell my dad.${prompt};
Oh, and better not tell Two, either. He lectures me about every itty-bitty thing I do!${prompt};
Aw, now what am I supposed to do? I'll get beat up without it... Huh? Oh, nothing!${prompt};
Hmm... I'm pretty sure everybody my age knows what ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} is.${prompt};
Thank you! As long as I've got this and Mom's ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, I'll finally beat that guy!${prompt};
Here. This is for you.${prompt};
AnOthEr★fIght, MaSteR PaNta? NoT★gOoD tO fIgHt. NoT★goOd tO HuRt★pEopLe.${prompt};
Oh, not again! You're always in my face! Just leave me alone for once!${prompt};
LEavE★aLoNe?${prompt};
Yeah! I don't need you anymore! You always treat me like a kid! Just go find a place of your own!${prompt};
PlAce oF★My owN? But★liKe eVerYonE HerE★in HoMe.${prompt};
No, anywhere but here!${prompt};
BuT I★wAnt sTaY★herE.${prompt};
You're so thick-headed! I said no!${prompt};
YOu... YoU★nOt nEeD me?${prompt};
Man, he'd lecture my ears off. That should shut him up for a while.${prompt};
Okay! As long as I've got this ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} and Mom's ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, I'll finally beat that guy!${prompt};
Two? Two...? Where are you, Two?${prompt};
Well, that's strange. I told him I needed him. It's not like him to forget...${prompt};
Well, I can't just wait around for him. Would you mind running a little errand for me instead?${prompt};
I can't find my ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} anywhere. And I really need it.${prompt};
I can only get them from the Culinarians' Guild in Windurst. Please, would you mind bringing one back for me?${prompt};
Will you do Naruru this favor?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
I can't right now.${prompt};
Thank you so much! I bet you think soup pots are all the same, but I can tell the difference! I'll be sure to return the favor somehow.${prompt};
I think the Culinarians' Guild in Windurst should have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. But I remember it wasn't for sale as merchandise. Better ask one of the cooks there.${prompt};
Oh, dear... Really? Well, I hope you change your mind.${prompt};
Say, if it isn't too much trouble, could you go grab me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} just like my old one? The culinarians in Windurst carry them.${prompt};
Thank you! It turned out my ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} had a big hole in it! I suppose they just don't make them thick enough. Anyway, thanks so much.${prompt};
Now, here's a little something for your trouble.${prompt};
But I wonder where Two could be...${prompt};
Hey, I haven't seen Two lately. Did you send him off someplace?${prompt};
No, dear... He must have just wandered off. I wonder what's the matter with him.${prompt};
Yeah, it's not like him. We'd better ask the neighbors if they've seen him.${prompt};
But where could he be?${prompt};
Hmph.${prompt};
What was I thinking, fighting that guy? I should've listened to Two.${prompt};
Don't tell Mom about the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. I busted a big hole in it! I'm dead meat if she finds out.${prompt};
But I was too hard on Two. I gotta tell him I'm sorry. Say, have you seen him anywhere? I wonder where he went.${prompt};
Man, I can't find Two anywhere! Where could he be?${prompt};
It's all my fault. I never should've said those things. There's so much I still want to tell him.${prompt};
I can't believe that could happen to our Two! ${name-player}, please help us!${prompt};
I hope Two comes back safe.${prompt};
Our home feels so empty without Two.${prompt};
We'll never be able to tell Two how much we miss him. And...And I'll never get the chance to tell him I'm sorry!${prompt};
But it's too late. I never should've said those things!${prompt};
HeLlo. NIcE★meeT yOu.${prompt};
It's Two! Two! Are you better now?${prompt};
We★meEt BeFore? HoW★yoU kNow★mY naMe?${prompt};
It's me, Panta-Putta! Oh, no... You can't remember, can you?${prompt};
PaNta★PuTTa...? Me★knOw nAmE. NaMe★brInG baCK★meMorY.${prompt};
All right!${prompt};
This should activate it.${prompt};
Really? Activate!${prompt};
WheRe? WHere★aM I?${prompt};
Whoa! It works!${prompt};
You're a guest in my home in Jeuno. We found you alone in a cave, so we brought you here.${prompt};
WhAt aBouT★waR?${prompt};
So, you've been asleep since the war, huh? Well, don't worry. There hasn't been a battle in ages.${prompt};
I nOt★hAve to★hUrt pEopLe?${prompt};
That's right. I need you to help around the house.${prompt};

Of course! Stay as long as you please.${prompt};

PaNta★PUttA, whAt is★Matter? YoU say yoU★haPpY, But you★Cry.${prompt};

Thanks a million! I don't know what to say! Well, here's a little something for you.${prompt};
I'm sure Two and I will keep on arguing, but I always want him to stay.${prompt};
After all, he's my very best friend.${prompt};
PaNtA★PutTa, leT us★sHoPpIng.${prompt};
We're so grateful for all you've done. I'm sure you've taught Panta a valuable lesson, too.${prompt};
I'm so happy Two is back with us. Thank you so much!${prompt};
What? You want me to sign your petition for the clock tower? Well, why not?${prompt};
I hope your petition's a success.${prompt};
Who the hell are you? Get outta here!${prompt};
Who the hell are you?${prompt};
Oh, you were there with those chocobos in Upper Jeuno, weren't ya?${prompt};
Well, give that thief a message for me. That bird's mine, and I'm gonna get it back...one way or another!${prompt};
Did you find him, Dad?${prompt};
None of your business. Now go get ready for school.${prompt};
Okay.${prompt};
Just tell that scumbag to give back what's mine.${prompt};
You again? How many times do I gotta tell ya? That chocobo's mine. Go tell him I want it back, or else.${prompt};
Who the... Oh, it's you. My kid's down with an awful fever.${prompt};
The doc said an herb from Qufim should bring the fever down, but I have to stay here and watch over him.${prompt};
I feel bad sayin' this, but could you go find some for me?${prompt};
I was gonna head out once he started feeling better, but I don't have much time! Please!${prompt};
Will you bring me the herb?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I'll go.;
No way.${prompt};
Thanks. I won't forget it!${prompt};
Aauhh... Daddy...${prompt};
It's okay... Hang in there!${prompt};
There's a special flower on Qufim that only blooms at night. The doc said its roots should bring down his fever. Please, hurry!${prompt};
Heh, typical... But come back if you ever change your mind. I don't care who helps me now.${prompt};
There's a special flower on Qufim that only blooms at night. The doc said its roots should bring down his fever. Please, hurry!${prompt};
Hello. Are you here for my dad?${prompt};
He went out to run an errand, but he said he'd be right back.${prompt};
Oh, yeah. He asked me to give this to you.${prompt};
Well, I've got places to go to. See you later!${prompt};
Looks like nobody's home.${prompt};
Oh, it's you. Thanks to you, I remembered what it is that keeps me going. For that, you have my sincerest thanks.${prompt};
Hey, say thank you for the medicine, okay?${prompt};
Thank you very much!${prompt};
You'd make a great beastmaster. I'll do my best to return to the basics, like you.${prompt};
Hey, who do you think you are!? You don't like my music? I'm just a loser who can't write and can't play!${prompt};
Love... Romance... It's all fake! Cursed women are like measles!${prompt};
Ugh... Malliebell... This time she's left me forever...${prompt};
Looks like his girlfriend dumped him. He probably doesn't want to talk right now. Best leave him be.${prompt};
Nothing's more pathetic than a broken-hearted man.${prompt};
He's forgotten why he took up the lute in the first place. Well, it's something we all have to face some time or another.${prompt};
Some men give up and turn back. But most find a way over it, while some are strong enough to bust right through. That's when you finally become someone.${prompt};
He's at his own crossroads. He has to figure it out for himself.${prompt};
Have you heard of Lewenhart?${prompt};
Everywhere he goes, fantastic melodies follow. He is the bard for all bards, a legend among our kind.${prompt};
He should still be wandering somewhere out there, but nobody has seen him for ages.${prompt};
Someone of his stature could easily settle down and live quite comfortably. Perhaps he'll keep wandering his whole life. Who knows what thoughts such a creative mind entertains?${prompt};
So now you're one of us, huh? Well, may we bring much harmony to this world!${prompt};
What? You could be such a fine bard! What are you thinking? We could bring so much harmony to this world!${prompt};
Say, have you seen the song rrrunes in Buburimu? They contain the words to the song that torn-apart lovers sang to each other many years ago.${prompt};
The lyrics are simple, but they hit you right in the heart. It's a really good song!${prompt};
No matter how much the worrrld changes, people are still the same. Oh, how I long to be loved like that...${prompt};
Well, anyway... I bet those bitter lyrics would rrreally cheer up the broken-hearted.${prompt};
Oh, you've been to Buburimu? They say couples descend on the place at nightfall. How do they dodge the monsterrrs?${prompt};
"And you know what? There's another set of rrrunes in Valkurm...with the opposing set of lyrics! It's a fabulous spot for a date; take it from me.${prompt}";
When you rrread the lyrics on Buburimu after you've seen the ones on Valkurm, it brings the tears all over again. Oh, sad songs are so moving!${prompt};
Oh, you're a barrrd too? Then stop by more often!${prompt};
Say, you should be a barrrd. What are you thinking?${prompt};
See! That man by the table looks so full of life, doesn't he? Of course, not long ago I wouldn't have stood near him!${prompt};
This song's so old... Are you making fun of me, with this old song!?${prompt};
Now, now, my young friend. What's all that fuss? Come, let me get you something.${prompt};
I thought you were like me, a man who lives for song and dance. Was I wrong?${prompt};
Who are you? Leave me alone!${prompt};
Oh, come, now... Oh, you were talking about that song. It's a great tune, isn't it?${prompt};
No it ain't! Nobody cares about such an oldie.${prompt};
Well, my apologies, but have you ever even tried it? Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not good, you know.${prompt};
Hmm...${prompt};
Just give it a try. What have you got to lose?${prompt};
Good to see you again.${prompt};
I have a feeling we'll meet again. I hope by then you'll have learned to appreciate this song.${prompt};
I've seen him before, somewhere...${prompt};
Who does he think he is? He doesn't know a thing about all the pain I've gone through!${prompt};
Wait, could he be...? Naw, he couldn't be.${prompt};
It's you! Thank you so much!${prompt};
I had lost all confidence in life. But thanks to you, I think about those beautiful words written in stone whenever I feel down.${prompt};
I feel a new composition bubbling forth inside me! Once it's done, I want you to hear it!${prompt};
Hey, I ain't got nothin' to say to ya. Bugger off, ${choice-player-gender}[you shmuck/sweetheart].${prompt};
Castle Oztroja? What you gonna go there for? Well, you can go get killed for all I care. Ain't got nothin' to do with me!${prompt};
But, hey, you gotta have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} to get in there. And not just any old torch... You need a special one from a tree on the Sauromugue Champaign!${prompt};
And whaddaya know... We're all outta the stuff! Maybe Fickie's got some extra. He stops by Oztroja once in a while.${prompt};
He's out on the streets again, ain't he? I can never figger out why he's gotta be so buddy-buddy with all them people!${prompt};
Muck, I'm home!${prompt};
Well, speak of the devil! Hey, you got ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} on ya?${prompt};
Yeah, I've got one.${prompt};
Well, cough it up for this ${choice-player-gender}[tough guy/sweetheart] right here.${prompt};
No problem. I was just going to head out to Castle Oztroja right now.${prompt};
Hey, whaddaya tryin' to say? I never asked you to head out there.${prompt};
I was just playing with Verena, but she's feeling down. And I know why.${prompt};
The beasties outside town are getting restless. That makes Verena worried. So I'm going to Oztroja and ask them to settle down.${prompt};
I think the beasties outside can get along with people, like I could with Verena. I really believe so.${prompt};
Yeah, maybe you got a point there.${prompt};
Well, I'm off.${prompt};
Hey, Fickie...${prompt};
Yeah, Muck?${prompt};
You be careful out there.${prompt};
I'll be okay. They'll listen to me.${prompt};
Yeah, my generation can't forget the war, so it's real hard to relate.${prompt};
But you kids don't remember none of that. So I think you can bridge the gap. Yeah, for all of us!${prompt};
Fickie? Is Fickie here?${prompt};
Hey, you just missed him. Said somethin' about goin' to Castle Oztroja. You didn't see him on your way in here?${prompt};
No, it's just... Some adventurers said they were going out to hunt beastmen, so I got so worried...${prompt};
I always told him to stay here in town. I told him if people found him in a dungeon somewhere, they might mistake him for a bad beastman, and then they'd...${prompt};
Ain't nothin' you can do. That kid's a beastie, and even the people in this town give us the cold shoulder.${prompt};
Well, he don't belong out there none neither... But I still think he's safer out there than in here.${prompt};
I'm so worried about him.${prompt};
That girl understands things that only us beasties do. Maybe Fickie and her can break down the walls that keep us apart.${prompt};
I just hope they watch out for those guys cravin' that mysterious power.${prompt};
Oops... Hey, forget about it.${prompt};
Hey, Fickie's nothin' but an outsider here. Now, he don't belong out there none neither, but I think they'll treat him better.${prompt};
Hey, I heard about Fickie. Relax, I ain't gonna take it out on ya. But with him gone, everything's gone back the way it was before.${prompt};
Welcome! You stand before Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru! Speak to me, and all will be revealed.${prompt};
I know why you came! Your life is at a crossroads, and you need a guide. Don't hide anything from me... I can see everything!${prompt};
Life is a twisting maze. One false step, and you'll never find the exit. That's where I can help. Allow me to pointaru the way.${prompt};
If it is guidance you seek, I can prepare your ${item-singular: 7[2]}. Are you ready to see the future, my young wanderer?${prompt};
Have your own ${item-singular: 7[2]} made?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
So be it. Seek me out whenever you need my powers.${prompt};
I require ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} in order to constructaru your ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Immerse the ${item-singular: 6[2]} in the pool of holy water inside the Maze of Shakhrami. After a time, it will become a ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
I will keep your ${item-singular: 7[2]} safe here in my abode, ready for divining your future at any time. Farewell, and may fortune smile upon you!${prompt};
Why, this is ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} of high quality! Take this and immerse it in the pool of holy water inside the Maze of Shakhrami.${prompt};
Only then will it be purged of impurities, and become a ${item-singular: 7[2]}. Good luck!${prompt};
Excellent. You have yourself ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}! It seems perfectly suited for the foretelling of what may come.${prompt};
No, don't listen to him! He doesn't know what he's talking aboutaru!${prompt};
Chululu!? Shoo! You forget that I was--${prompt};
That you were valedictorian in divination school? Okay, whatever... As if grades had anything to do with fortune-telling!${prompt};
Listen to me, Mr. Most Likely to Succeed! To tell fortunes, you need experience, and that's what you lack dearly!${prompt};
I worked side-by-side with my mother, telling fortunes since I was just a cub. See the difference?${prompt};
Why, you-- But my fortunes are never wrong!${prompt};
Okay, then, tell me my fortune for once. Oh, no! Let me guess... It's not the right hour? The planets aren't in line?${prompt};
I-I cannot...${prompt};
Hmph, I knew it! Get the picture? Bye, now!${prompt};
Oh...confound her!${prompt};
Please, pay her no attention! She's been pester-westering me since we were cubs.${prompt};
Of course I can tell her fortune, but due to circumstances beyond my control...${prompt};
At any rate... Please don't hesitate to come and seek your future with me.${prompt};
Shall I read your fortune?${prompt};
Hear your fortune?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not now.${prompt};
Ahem. Very well...${prompt};
Please come again.${prompt};

Last magic rubbish day, I accidentally threw out my ${item-singular: 7[2]}. Oh, if that imposter-woster Chululu found out, it'd be the end of me!${prompt};
That's where you come intaru! I need you to procure another one just like it. And of course, I'll reward you handsomely. Well? What do you say?${prompt};
Do you accept?;
${selection-lines};
With pleasure.;
Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt};
A thousand thanks, my dear clientaru! I wish you the best in this endeavor-wevor! Oh, and don't say a word to Chululu, I beg you!${prompt};
Too busy, eh? Pity. Now what am I to do...?${prompt};
I knew I could count on you. I can't sleep without my ${item-singular: 7[2]}!${prompt};
Why, thank you so much! You have my dearest gratitude. Please, accept this with my thanks.${prompt};
Aha! I haven't seen you before. I am Madam Chululu. I specialize in divining compatibility.${prompt};
Have you ever questioned whether you and your sweetheart are truly compatible? Or whether you and another adventurer could fight well together?${prompt};
That's what I am here to tell you. Just give me a try. There's no risk and no obligation.${prompt};
Hear your fortune?;
${selection-lines};
At once.;
Not now.${prompt};
Excellent! First, you must collect Tarut cards. There are a total of four different cards: the Hermit, the King, Death, and the Fool.${prompt};
I will give you five of the same card. You must trade with other-wothers and bring the four different cards back to me.${prompt};
Only then can your fortune be told. Good luck, and may the winds of fate favor you!${prompt};
Well, come back anytime. You are always welcome here.${prompt};
Bring me the four Tarut cards: the Hermit, the King, Death, and the Fool. You can do with the fifth card as you please. Throw it away, give it away, I care not.${prompt};
Yes, this is all of them!${prompt};
Sorry, but I'd stay away from this place if I were you.${prompt};
Kurou-Morou! You stay away from my clientaru! You know I'm an experienced--!${prompt};
“I'm an experienced fortune-teller, trained from youth by my mother.” I've heard that line a gagillion times.${prompt};
I think your clientaru would be shocked to hear the kind of grades you got in school.${prompt};
Listen. When it comes to telling fortunes, a strong foundation is paramountaru. Otherwise, the winds of fate would simply knock you over.${prompt};
In our school days, I wasn't out playing like you. I was inside, studying-wudying all I could. You're not half the fortune-teller I am.${prompt};
Well, so what? My fortunes are always spot-ontaru.${prompt};
Maybe you have a point. After all, you said our compatibility rating was zero. And look at us! Hahaha!${prompt};
Why's he so happy about our compatibility, or lack thereof...?${prompt};
Oh, don't mind him. We've known each other since we were kids. He doesn't understand women at all. That's why he always comes to bother me.${prompt};
And don't you listen to a word he says! You can't go wrong with my fortunes!${prompt};
Shall I test your compatibility-wility?${prompt};
Have your compatibility tested?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
Have a nice day.${prompt};
Very well. Just fill in the name of your partner where it says “Password.”${prompt};
Your race: ${number: 0}  Your job: ${number: 2};
Your level: ${number: 4}  Your nationality: ${number: 6};
Partner's race: ${number: 1}  Partner's job: ${number: 3};
Partner's level: ${number: 5} Partner's nationality: ${number: 7}${prompt};
Your partner-wartner doesn't seem to be nearby.${prompt};
Of course you're compatible with yourself! Hello!?${prompt};
Please fill in your partner's name.${prompt};
What? With me!? Spare me.${prompt};
What? With that creep? Over my dead body!${prompt};
Racial compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Gender compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Level compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Job compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
National compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Total compatibility: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
DEBUG: ${number: 0}${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Why, this is amazing... A perfect fit! The two of you can overcome any obstacle-wobstacle.${prompt};
Yes, highly compatible! Go and do your bestaru for each other.${prompt};
Yes, there's some compatibility-wility. But you must be open to each other. Try to make your feelings known.${prompt};
Well, not bad. Just don't expectaru too much.${prompt};
You're not very compatible, as a matter of fact. I'd advise you not to worry, except that my fortunes are always right.${prompt};
Yikesie-wikesie! Zero compatibility! Just like me and my nemesis! I'd steer clear from this one if I were you.${prompt};
Thanks for letting me handle your fortune-telling needs. Actually, there's something I'd like to ask you.${prompt};
"I've got a pile of rubbish I forgot to put out on magic trash day. It's not like regular garbage; someone has to collect and treat it. I don't know what to do!${prompt}";
I'd just die if Kurou-Morou saw it! Please, would you take it to the incinerator in the Garlaige Citadel?${prompt};
Will you dispose of the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
I will.;
I'm sorry, but I can't.${prompt};
Really? I knew you'd help. And don't say a word to Kurou-Morou about this!${prompt};
Really? Well, what was I thinking, asking my own client? But I wonder what I should do...${prompt};
Find the incinerator inside the Garlaige Citadel. Please hurry. I'm counting on you!${prompt};
Well, thanks for taking care of all thataru! Now I can sleep soundly. Here, perhaps you'll find this useful.${prompt};
You are now ready to have your fortune told by Kurou-Morou.${prompt};
You are now ready to have your fortune told by Chululu.${prompt};
It's locked.${prompt};
Welcome to Neptune's Spire!${prompt};C'est verrouillé.${prompt}
Well?;Bienvenue à l'Éperon de Neptune !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Alors ?
Show me your goods.;
I'm fine.;Montrez-moi vos marchandises.
${prompt};Ça va, merci.
Have a nice day.${prompt};

Magic's my game! Watch your money disappear! Hey, it's a joke. Sheesh.${prompt};Pour l'instant, nous exerçons nos métiers du mieux que nous pouvons. Allez, voyez s'il y a quelque chose que vous aimez.${prompt}
Gobbiebags are the bomb! They carry lotsa loot! Ya want one too, don'tcha?${prompt};La magie, c'est mon truc ! Regardez votre argent disparaître ! Hé, c'est une blague. Pff.${prompt}
Us Gobbies got bigger bags than you. Ya want one, don'tcha?${prompt};Les sacs de gobelins sont super ! Ils transportent plein de butin ! Vous en voulez un aussi, hein ?${prompt}
Hey, your bag's bigger than before, but compared to our gobbiebags, it's still puny. You jealous, right?${prompt};Nous, les gobelins, avons des sacs plus grands que vous. Vous en voulez un, hein ?${prompt}
Whoa, your bag's just as big as our gobbiebags! Wait a minute... You ain't thinkin' what I think you're thinkin', are ya?${prompt};Hé, votre sac est plus grand qu'avant, mais comparé à nos sacs de gobelins, il est encore petit. Vous êtes jaloux, non ?${prompt}
Well, well, well... If it isn't the local Greedalox and ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] big bag. Wait a minute... You ain't thinkin' what I think you're thinkin', are ya?${prompt};Whoa, votre sac est aussi grand que nos sacs de gobelins ! Attendez une minute... Vous ne pensez pas à ce que je pense que vous pensez, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I bet you want a bigger bag, don'tcha?;Eh bien, eh bien, eh bien... Si ce n'est pas le Greedalox local et son grand sac. Attendez une minute... Vous ne pensez pas à ce que je pense que vous pensez, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Je parie que vous voulez un sac plus grand, hein ?
Yes, very much.;
Not at all.${prompt};Oui, beaucoup.
I bet you want a bigger bag, don'tcha?;Pas du tout.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Je parie que vous voulez un sac plus grand, hein ?
Yes, very much.;
Not at all.${prompt};Oui, beaucoup.
No? And here I was, thinkin' I might bump up your bag size. Too bad!${prompt};Pas du tout.${prompt}
Finally come to your senses, huh? It's about time!;Non ? Et moi qui pensais que vous voudriez une taille de sac plus grande. Dommage !${prompt}
We Gobs have an old saying...${prompt};Vous venez enfin de vous rendre compte, hein ? Il était temps !
“If ya don't use it, sell it!;Nous les Gobs avons un vieil adage...${prompt}
If ya don't want it, sell it!;"""Si tu ne l'utilises pas, vends-le !"
If ya can't sell it, eat it!”;Si tu ne le veux pas, vends-le !
Ya got it?${prompt};"Si tu ne peux pas le vendre, mange-le !"""
Oh, yeah? Well, hook me up with these, and I'll bump up your bag size a smidgen.${prompt};Tu as compris ?${prompt}
You like the gobbiebags, don'tcha? I'll tell ya what. Hook me up with these, and I'll bump up your bag size a smidgen.${prompt};Oh, ouais ? Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais augmenter un peu la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
Hook me up with these, and I'll bump up your bag size some more.${prompt};Vous aimez les gobbiebags, hein ? Je vais vous dire quoi. Donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais augmenter un peu la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
You like the gobbiebags, don'tcha? Well, hook me up with these, and I'll bump up your bag size some more.${prompt};Donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais augmenter encore la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
Well, hook me up with these, and I'll max out your bag size.${prompt};Vous aimez les gobbiebags, hein ? Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais augmenter encore la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
You like the gobbiebags, don'tcha? Well, hook me up with these, and I'll max out your bag size.${prompt};Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais maximiser la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
Well, hook me up with these, and I'll make your bag as big as a gobbiebag.${prompt};Vous aimez les gobbiebags, hein ? Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais maximiser la taille de votre sac.${prompt}
You like the gobbiebags, don'tcha? Well, hook me up with these, and I'll make your bag as big as a gobbiebag.${prompt};Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais faire de votre sac aussi grand qu'un gobbiebag.${prompt}
We Gobs have an old saying:;Vous aimez les gobbiebags, hein ? Eh bien, donnez-moi ceux-là, et je vais faire de votre sac aussi grand qu'un gobbiebag.${prompt}
“If ya don't use it, sell it!;Nous, les Gobs, avons un vieil adage:
If ya don't want it, sell it!;“Si tu ne l'utilises pas, vends-le!
If ya can't sell it, eat it!”${prompt};Si tu ne le veux pas, vends-le!
We call Gobs that don't live by that rule, “Greedaloxes.”;Si tu ne peux pas le vendre, mange-le!”${prompt}
Ya sure smell like a Greedalox, but you ain't a Gob, so I guess our rules don't apply.${prompt};
You hook me up with the following goods, and I'll whip ya together a bag so big you'll be able to haul your grandma around in it!${prompt};
I want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Bring 'em to me and I'll make your bag bigger. But I ain't gonna tell ya how it's done. Ancient Gobbie secret!${prompt};
There you go, pal. Bigger bag for ya. It still don't compare to gobbiebags, though.${prompt};
Hey, your bag's as big as ours... I don't think I like that one bit.${prompt};
That's one mighty big bag you've got there... We Gobs don't like Greedaloxes one bit!${prompt};
You people are all the same--Greedaloxes! The whole stinkin' lot of ya!;
But, ya know, I never can turn down a tasty business proposal.${prompt};
You hook me up with the following goods, and I'll throw ya together a bag so big, it can double as a summer home!${prompt};
So, ya want me to bag that bag of yours bigger in exchange for this? How'd ya know what we goblins like?${prompt};Tu veux que je t'aide avec ces marchandises, et je te ferai un sac tellement grand qu'il pourrait servir de résidence d'été !${prompt}
We goblins aren't inta that kinda trading. Not like the lot of ya, with all your stuff and your things.${prompt};Alors, tu veux que je fasse ton sac plus grand en échange de ça ? Comment savais-tu ce que nous, les gobelins, aimons ?${prompt}
...Okay, but just this once.${prompt};Nous, les gobelins, nous ne sommes pas dans ce genre d'échanges. Pas comme vous autres, avec toutes vos affaires et vos choses.${prompt}
Hey, we're fixin' up some stew. Gobbie food's good food!${prompt};...D’accord, mais juste cette fois.${prompt}
I knew that wild chocobos smell, but even domesticated ones reek terribly!${prompt};Hé, nous cuisinons un ragoût. La nourriture gobeline, c'est de la bonne nourriture !${prompt}
Don't say thataru! The chocobo'll get mad.${prompt};Je savais que les chocobos sauvages sentent mauvais, mais même les domestiqués puent terriblement !${prompt}
Nonsense! Chocobos cannot understand us.${prompt};Ne dis pas ça ! Le chocobo va se fâcher.${prompt}
Uh-oh...${prompt};N'importe quoi ! Les chocobos ne peuvent pas nous comprendre.${prompt}
What is it?${prompt};Oh-oh...${prompt}
Yaaah!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?${prompt}
Why, that chocobo bit me! Curse him and all his flock!${prompt};Yaaah !${prompt}
I like how chocobos smell.${prompt};Pourquoi, ce chocobo m'a mordu ! Maudissez-le, lui et tout son troupeau !${prompt}
That man from the chocobo corral sure was scary.${prompt};J'aime l'odeur des chocobos.${prompt}
He started yelling at the chocobos for no reason. I'm sure they were terrified of him.${prompt};Cet homme de l'enclos à chocobos était vraiment effrayant.${prompt}
But he obviously loves his son a lot. How strange...${prompt};Il a commencé à crier sur les chocobos pour aucune raison. Je suis sûr qu'ils étaient terrifiés par lui.${prompt}
I heard that poor chocobo master's son got sick. Now he's got to watch over both his son and his chocobos. Poor guy...${prompt};Mais il aime évidemment beaucoup son fils. C'est étrange...${prompt}
Did you hear? He lost his wife after she got sick a long time ago. He was so poor, he couldn't afford any medicine for her.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que le pauvre fils du maître chocobo était tombé malade. Maintenant, il doit veiller sur son fils et ses chocobos. Pauvre type...${prompt}
He got so scary after she died.${prompt};Tu as entendu ? Il a perdu sa femme après qu'elle soit tombée malade il y a longtemps. Il était si pauvre qu'il ne pouvait pas se permettre de lui acheter des médicaments.${prompt}
I heard that the chocobo master's son got better. Sometimes I hear him laughing again.${prompt};Il est devenu si effrayant après sa mort.${prompt}
I'm so surprised. That chocobo master doesn't get angry at the chocobos anymore. I hope he stays that way forever.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que le fils du maître chocobo allait mieux. Parfois, je l'entends rire à nouveau.${prompt}
Yeah, really!${prompt};Je suis tellement surpris. Ce maître chocobo ne s'énerve plus contre les chocobos. J'espère qu'il restera ainsi pour toujours.${prompt}
This leads straight to the pier, where we launch ships overseas.${prompt};Oui, vraiment !${prompt}
Our boss has dreamed of sailing all over the world. To him, this business is just something he promised his dad he'd do.${prompt};Ce chemin mène droit vers le quai, où nous lançons des navires à l'étranger.${prompt}
Oh, you want ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}, do ya? Sorry, but we ain't comfortable doin' business with ya. Come back once you've made a name for yourself.${prompt};Notre patron rêve de naviguer partout dans le monde. Pour lui, cette entreprise est simplement quelque chose qu'il a promis à son père de faire.${prompt}
So, you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}? Beastmen have all the trade routes shut tight for now.${prompt};Oh, tu veux ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}, hein ? Désolé, mais nous ne sommes pas à l’aise de faire affaire avec toi. Reviens une fois que tu t’es fait un nom.${prompt}
But not Tenshodo! We always got the hard-to-find goods in stock. Come on, let's make a deal.${prompt};Alors, tu cherches ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} ? Les bêtes bloquent tous les itinéraires commerciaux pour l’instant.${prompt}
Right now, we're looking for ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Get us one, and the ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} is yours. Whaddaya say?${prompt};Mais pas Tenshodo ! Nous avons toujours en stock les marchandises difficiles à trouver. Allez, faisons affaire.${prompt}
Well, look what we have here... Alrighty, here you go, pal!${prompt};En ce moment, nous cherchons ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Apporte-nous-en un, et le ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} est à toi. Qu’est-ce que tu en dis ?${prompt}
Hey, have you seen Lady Verena around? She usually doesn't stay out this late...${prompt};Eh bien, regarde ce que nous avons ici... D'accord, voilà, mon pote !${prompt}
Lion came, so something must be up. I'd like to get out there and do some fighting myself, but I'm stuck here until Boss gives the order.${prompt};Hé, as-tu vu Lady Verena quelque part ? Elle ne reste généralement pas dehors aussi tard...${prompt}
I couldn't believe it when Boss came back carrying Lady Verena. He looked like he had been run over by a stampede of chocobos.${prompt};Lion est venu, donc quelque chose doit se tramer. J'aimerais sortir là-bas et me battre moi-même, mais je suis coincé ici jusqu'à ce que le Boss donne l'ordre.${prompt}
I wonder what the hell happened up there at Delkfutt's Tower... No, on second thought, don't tell me. I don't want to know.${prompt};Je n'arrivais pas à croire quand le Boss est revenu en portant Lady Verena. Il avait l'air d'avoir été écrasé par un troupeau de chocobos.${prompt}
Lately, Boss has got that look in his eyes... You know, the one that makes your spine tingle with fear.${prompt};Je me demande ce qui s'est passé là-haut à la Tour de Delkfutt... Non, à y réfléchir, ne me le dis pas. Je ne veux pas le savoir.${prompt}
Well, all's well that ends well.;Dernièrement, le patron a ce regard dans les yeux... Vous savez, celui qui vous fait frissonner de peur.${prompt}
I like you and all, but just between you and me, I'm against you joining us. I don't want to have to compete against an adventurer of your caliber!${prompt};Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Watch your back. Our boss, Aldo, is a rrreal pirate. I can be quite a scoundrel, too, but I ain't nothing compared to him.${prompt};Je t'aime bien et tout, mais entre nous, je suis contre le fait que tu te joignes à nous. Je ne veux pas avoir à me mesurer à un aventurier de ton calibre!${prompt}
You follow me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]? Whenever Aldo's deep in thought, it's best to just look the other way.${prompt};Surveillez vos arrières. Notre patron, Aldo, est un vrai pirate. Je peux être un sacré vaurien aussi, mais je ne suis rien comparé à lui.${prompt}
After all, he's seen hell with those eyes. Of course, lots of people suffered in the wars twenty years ago, but most of them never came back.${prompt};Vous me suivez, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]? Quand Aldo est perdu dans ses pensées, il vaut mieux regarder ailleurs.${prompt}
Somehow Verena seems different than the other girls. Some folks say she can rrread animals' minds.${prompt};Après tout, il a vu l'enfer de ses propres yeux. Bien sûr, beaucoup de gens ont souffert pendant les guerres il y a vingt ans, mais la plupart d'entre eux ne sont jamais revenus.${prompt}
She's a fine chocobo rrrider, and unlike my boss, she gets along fine with those beastmen. Those two always fight about that.${prompt};D'une certaine manière, Verena semble différente des autres filles. Certains disent qu'elle peut lire les pensées des animaux.${prompt}
Hey, you made it through! Thanks for the package. Now, go back and get paid.${prompt};C'est une excellente cavalière de chocobo, et contrairement à mon patron, elle s'entend bien avec les hommes-bêtes. Ces deux-là se disputent toujours à ce sujet.${prompt}
Hey, you made it through! But look at this junk. It's trash! Next time go easier on the goods, okay?${prompt};Hé, tu as réussi ! Merci pour le colis. Maintenant, retourne te faire payer.${prompt}
You have completed your delivery of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Hé, tu as réussi ! Mais regarde cette camelote. C'est de la poubelle ! La prochaine fois, prends plus soin des marchandises, d'accord ?${prompt}
Due to extensive damage, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} are thrown away.${prompt};Vous avez complété la livraison de ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Hey, did you hear? Verena is missing and our boss is in a mess over it. If you ask me, I think they just had another one of their sibling quarrels.${prompt};En raison des dégâts importants, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sont jetés.${prompt}
The other day when Lion came, she was in and out of here like a white rrrabbit on a full moon. I wonder what she could be up to?${prompt};Hé, tu as entendu ? Verena a disparu et notre patron est dans tous ses états à cause de ça. Si tu veux mon avis, je pense qu'ils ont juste eu une autre de leurs querelles fraternelles.${prompt}
Verena was at Delkfutt's Tower!? And I thought that she and the boss had just had a fight... Boy, am I an idiot!${prompt};L'autre jour, quand Lion est venue, elle est entrée et sortie d'ici comme un lapin blanc par une nuit de pleine lune. Je me demande ce qu'elle mijote ?${prompt}
Boss is talking about setting off on some adventure. You're going too, aren't you? It must be something rrreally big if they didn't ask me to come along.${prompt};Verena était à la tour de Delkfutt!? Et moi qui pensais qu'elle et le patron s'étaient juste disputés... Quel idiot je suis !${prompt}
I can't do much for you, but good luck out there. Wouldn't want to see you lose any of your nine lives.${prompt};Le patron parle de partir à l'aventure. Tu y vas aussi, n'est-ce pas ? Ça doit être quelque chose de vraiment gros s'ils ne m'ont pas demandé de venir.${prompt}
Welcome back. From the looks of it, you had a pretty tough time out there... But that's about all I know. Boss never tells us about anything that goes on...${prompt};Je ne peux pas faire grand-chose pour toi, mais bonne chance là-bas. Je ne voudrais pas te voir perdre une de tes neuf vies.${prompt}
But as long as you are okay...;Bon retour. À en juger par ton apparence, tu as eu des moments difficiles là-bas... Mais c'est à peu près tout ce que je sais. Le patron ne nous dit jamais rien de ce qui se passe...${prompt}
Ahem! Don't be a stranger, ${name-player}!${prompt};Mais tant que tu vas bien...
If only Lion were okay, as well...${prompt};Hum ! Ne sois pas un étranger, ${name-player}!${prompt}
Welcome to the Tenshodo. You want something, we got it. We got all kinds of special merchandise you won't find anywhere else!${prompt};Si seulement Lion allait bien aussi...${prompt}
We ain't cheap, but you get what you pay for! Take your time, have a look around, see if there's somethin' you like.${prompt};Bienvenue au Tenshodo. Vous cherchez quelque chose, nous l'avons. Nous avons toutes sortes de marchandises spéciales que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs !${prompt}
Our boss looks all hairy-scary, but he caves in to his sister Verena all the time.${prompt};Nous ne sommes pas bon marché, mais vous en avez pour votre argent ! Prenez votre temps, jetez un coup d'œil, voyez s'il y a quelque chose qui vous plaît.${prompt}
Verena's a really nice girl. We all think she's super-duper swell.${prompt};Notre patron a l'air effrayant, mais il cède toujours à sa sœur Verena.${prompt}
But don't you lay a single-wingle finger on her. People who do... Well, they have a tendency to be found dead, floating off the pier. So please, keep that in mind.${prompt};Verena est une fille vraiment gentille. Nous pensons tous qu'elle est super chouette.${prompt}
Wait, so all you got from Aldo was ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Kinda stingy-winjy of him, don't you think?${prompt};Mais ne posez pas un seul doigt sur elle. Les gens qui le font... Eh bien, ils ont tendance à être retrouvés morts, flottant au large de la jetée. Alors, gardez cela à l'esprit.${prompt}
There's a place in Beadeaux where you need ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} just to get in. If you want, we can try to hook you up.${prompt};Attends, tout ce que tu as eu d’Aldo, c’est ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ? Un peu radin de sa part, tu ne trouves pas ?${prompt}
Tell you what. I'll trade you ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} for ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, and I'll let you have ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} if you find me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};Il y a un endroit à Beadeaux où vous avez besoin de ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} et de ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} juste pour entrer. Si vous voulez, on peut essayer de vous arranger ça.${prompt}
Okey-dokey, here you go.${prompt};Je te propose un marché. Je te donne ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} en échange de ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, et je te laisserai avoir ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} si tu me trouves ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}
Hey, how'd you know we were lookin' for this? Well, anyway... Here you go!${prompt};Okidoki, voilà.${prompt}
Okey-dokey, here you go.${prompt};Hé, comment as-tu su que nous cherchions ça ? Bon, de toute façon... Voilà !${prompt}
Hey, how'd you know we were lookin' for this? Well, anyway... Here you go!${prompt};Okidoki, voilà.${prompt}
I'm shocked... I'm stunned... I can't believe that Lady-wady Verena is missing. If I had the time, I'd be out there searching...${prompt};Hé, comment as-tu su que nous cherchions ça ? Bon, de toute façon... Voilà !${prompt}
If anything happened to her, what would I do!?${prompt};Je suis choqué... Je suis abasourdi... Je ne peux pas croire que Lady Verena soit disparue. Si j'avais le temps, je serais dehors à chercher...${prompt}
That cutie-wootie Lion was here the other day talking to the boss. A lucky man, he is...${prompt};Si quelque chose lui arrivait, que ferais-je ?${prompt}
Lady-wady Verena is back, but she's not doing that good... What did she do to deserve this!?${prompt};Cette adorable Lion était ici l'autre jour, parlant avec le patron. Un homme chanceux, il est...${prompt}
What happened in Delkfutt's Tower!? You can tell me, we're buddy-wuddies!${prompt};Lady Verena est de retour, mais elle ne va pas très bien... Qu'a-t-elle fait pour mériter ça ?${prompt}
Tell him about what happened?;Que s'est-il passé dans la tour de Delkfutt ? Tu peux me le dire, nous sommes amis !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Lui parler de ce qui s'est passé ?
Yes.;
No.${prompt};Oui.
No, wait...;Non.${prompt}
Maybe it's better that I don't know.  I'll just pray for Lady-wady Verena's recovery, and ask her myself.${prompt};Non, attends...
You mean, it was that bad...?;Peut-être vaut-il mieux que je ne sache pas. Je vais juste prier pour le rétablissement de Dame Verena et lui demander moi-même.${prompt}
Okay, just forget that I asked.${prompt};Tu veux dire que c'était si grave... ?
Lady-wady Verena's bak in tip-top shape? That's great! Maybe I should go in and see how she's doing... But what if she's forgotten who I was!?${prompt};D'accord, oublie que j'ai posé la question.${prompt}
The boss told me to get his equipment ready-steady. But, when I asked him where he was going, he told me to mind my own busy-business!${prompt};Dame Verena est de retour en pleine forme ? C'est génial ! Peut-être que je devrais aller la voir... Mais et si elle avait oublié qui j'étais ?${prompt}
This is great! This is stupendous! I have a feeling that everything will finally-winally go back to being the way it was!${prompt};Le patron m'a dit de préparer son équipement. Mais quand je lui ai demandé où il allait, il m'a dit de m'occuper de mes affaires !${prompt}
But I'm still kinda worried about Verena... She's growing up so fast!${prompt};C'est génial ! C'est stupéfiant ! J'ai le sentiment que tout va enfin redevenir comme avant !${prompt}
Welcome to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We assist the community with job placement and labor arbitration.${prompt};Mais je suis quand même un peu inquiet pour Verena... Elle grandit tellement vite !${prompt}
What can I help you with?;Bienvenue à la Chambre de commerce et d'industrie. Nous aidons la communauté avec le placement professionnel et l'arbitrage du travail.${prompt}
${selection-lines};En quoi puis-je vous aider ?
Oh, nothing.;
I'd like ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}.;Oh, rien.
I'd like to start a petition.;Je voudrais ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}.
I want to learn about petitions.${prompt};Je voudrais commencer une pétition.
Have a nice day. Next!${prompt};Je veux en savoir plus sur les pétitions.${prompt}
The ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} costs ${number: 7} gil. Convenient routes connect Jeuno with the three allied nations. Passes are non-transferable, but never expire.${prompt};Passez une bonne journée. Suivant !${prompt}
The archduke occasionally issues them, but His Grace is not an easy man to meet.${prompt};Le ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} coûte ${number: 7} gil. Des itinéraires pratiques relient Jeuno aux trois nations alliées. Les laissez-passer sont incessibles mais n’expirent jamais.${prompt}
Purchase ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}?;L'archiduc les délivre occasionnellement, mais Son Altesse n'est pas facile à rencontrer.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Acheter ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} ?
Yes, please.;
No, not right now.${prompt};Oui, s'il vous plaît.
Thank you very much. Safe and pleasant journeys to you!${prompt};Non, pas maintenant.${prompt}
Um, you don't have enough money.${prompt};Merci beaucoup. Je vous souhaite un bon voyage!${prompt}
Oh, that clock tower? Yes, it's quite run down, so it's scheduled for demolition. The city needs a crane there, as ships anchor right beneath it.${prompt};Vous n'avez pas assez d'argent.${prompt}
Of course, if enough people oppose the plan, the authorities might reconsider. You'll need at least ${number: 1} signatories for the petition to be accepted.${prompt};Oh, cette tour de l'horloge ? Oui, elle est assez délabrée et sa démolition est prévue. La ville a besoin d'une grue à cet endroit, car les navires jettent l'ancre juste en dessous.${prompt}
Would you like a petition ledger?;Bien entendu, si un nombre suffisant de personnes s’opposent au projet, les autorités pourraient reconsidérer leur position. Il vous faudra au moins ${number : 1} signataires pour que la pétition soit acceptée.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Souhaitez-vous un registre des pétitions ?
Yes.;
No, thanks.${prompt};Oui.
Okay. Come back and submit the ledger once you have ${number: 1} signatures.${prompt};Non, merci.${prompt}
Find people who are interested in your cause. Of course, please try to respect people who don't share your views.${prompt};D'accord. Revenez et soumettez le registre une fois que vous avez ${number: 1} signatures.${prompt}
Um, I don't think you can carry any more.${prompt};Trouvez des personnes intéressées par votre cause. Bien sûr, veuillez respecter ceux qui ne partagent pas vos opinions.${prompt}
Gather ${number: 1} signatures for the petition. People who are interested in your cause should sign. And please respect those of differing views.${prompt};Eh bien, je ne pense pas que vous puissiez en porter plus.${prompt}
We can issue you a new ${item-singular: 7[2]} if you like. Of course, you'll have to start over with any signatures you've collected.${prompt};Rassemblez ${number: 1} signatures pour la pétition. Les personnes intéressées par votre cause devraient signer. Et veuillez respecter ceux qui ont des opinions différentes.${prompt}
Would you like another petition ledger?;Nous pouvons vous fournir un nouveau ${item-singular: 7[2]} si vous le souhaitez. Bien sûr, vous devrez recommencer avec toutes les signatures que vous avez collectées.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Souhaitez-vous un autre registre de pétition ?
Yeah.;
No, I'm all right.${prompt};Oui.
Very well. I'll prepare the necessary paperwork.${prompt};Non, ça va.${prompt}
You still need ${number: 0} more ${choice-plurality: 0}[signature/signatures].${prompt};Très bien. Je vais préparer les documents nécessaires.${prompt}
How's the petition going? Wow, you have quite a lot of signatures here. I'll submit this to the chamber board. I doubt they'll demolish the clock tower now.${prompt};Il vous manque encore ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[signature/signatures].${prompt}
You know, I came to Jeuno to shop at a splendid store called the “Tenshodo,” but I can't find it anywhere! Where could it be?${prompt};Comment se passe la pétition ? Wow, vous avez pas mal de signatures ici. Je vais soumettre cela au conseil municipal. Je doute qu'ils démolissent maintenant la tour de l'horloge.${prompt}
I can't wait to see their selection of fine jewelry and accessories. I'm not going home till I find it!${prompt};"Vous savez, je suis venu à Jeuno pour faire des achats dans un magasin splendide appelé le ""Tenshodo"", mais je ne le trouve nulle part ! Où pourrait-il être ?${prompt}"
They say it can be found “right under your nose.” But what could they mean?${prompt};Je suis impatient de voir leur sélection de bijoux et accessoires de luxe. Je ne rentrerai pas chez moi tant que je ne l'aurai pas trouvé !${prompt}
Oh, yes... I've seen people pass ${item-plural: 0[2]} to the front desk here, but they won't tell me where they got them. Where can I get one?${prompt};"On dit qu'il peut être trouvé ""juste sous votre nez"". Mais que peuvent-ils vouloir dire ?${prompt}"
What? You're a Tenshodo member now, too? And you're not going to give me an invite? How dare you!${prompt};Oh, oui... J’ai vu des gens passer ${item-plural: 0[2]} au bureau d’accueil ici, mais ils ne veulent pas me dire où ils les ont obtenus. Où puis-je en obtenir un ?${prompt}
I don't believe this! Well, fine! I'll find one myself!${prompt};Quoi ? Vous êtes aussi membre du Tenshodo maintenant ? Et vous ne allez pas me donner une invitation ? Comment osez-vous !${prompt}
Great bridges from the days of old span the straits below. Jeuno merely sprang up atop their ruins.${prompt};Je n'en crois pas mes yeux ! Eh bien, très bien ! Je vais en trouver un moi-même !${prompt}
No one knows how--or even why--our ancestors built the bridges. Of course, that doesn't stop us from living our lives atop them.${prompt};De grands ponts des temps anciens enjambent les détroits en dessous. Jeuno a simplement surgi au sommet de leurs ruines.${prompt}
And they're a great way to break the ice with strangers, don't you think?${prompt};Personne ne sait comment--ou même pourquoi--nos ancêtres ont construit les ponts. Bien sûr, cela ne nous empêche pas de vivre nos vies au-dessus.${prompt}
I heard Jeuno began about eighty years ago when fishermen settled here. It was just a tiny fishing village back then.${prompt};Et ils sont un excellent moyen de briser la glace avec des étrangers, vous ne trouvez pas ?${prompt}
As you can see from any map, Jeuno lies on a crossroads binding the three nations together. A hub of commerce, Jeuno grew wealthy.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que Jeuno a commencé il y a environ quatre-vingts ans lorsque des pêcheurs se sont installés ici. C'était juste un petit village de pêcheurs à l'époque.${prompt}
Soon it was filled with the bustle of buyer and seller. Our humble district captures that particular energy better than any other.${prompt};Comme vous pouvez le voir sur n'importe quelle carte, Jeuno se trouve à un carrefour reliant les trois nations. Un centre commercial, Jeuno est devenu riche.${prompt}
Huh? What am I doing here? I'm looking for work! I got fired from my last place. Something about talking too much...${prompt};Bientôt, il était rempli de l'agitation de l'acheteur et du vendeur. Notre humble quartier capture cette énergie particulière mieux que tout autre.${prompt}
“Do Not Disturb”${prompt};Hein ? Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ? Je cherche du travail ! J'ai été viré de mon dernier emploi. Quelque chose à propos de parler trop...${prompt}
We just got our compatibility read by that fortune-teller over there...${prompt};“Ne pas déranger”${prompt}
You won't believe it. Zero compatibility! I thought we were a perfect match for each other!${prompt};Nous venons de faire lire notre compatibilité par cette diseuse de bonne aventure là-bas...${prompt}
Come on, honey... It's just a fortune! Cheer up, okay?${prompt};Vous n'allez pas le croire. Zéro compatibilité ! Je pensais que nous étions parfaitement faits l'un pour l'autre !${prompt}
She won't listen to me. I'd be careful with fortunes if I were you.${prompt};Allez, chérie... Ce n'est qu'une prédiction ! Remonte-toi le moral, d'accord ?${prompt}
Hey! I'm changing!${prompt};Elle ne m'écoute pas. Je serais prudent avec les prédictions si j'étais toi.${prompt}
Oh, dear... There are so many to choose from! I don't know what to pick. By the way, do you think this looks good on me?${prompt};Hé ! Je me change !${prompt}
I don't think it does. I need something that jumps out and screams “me.” Hmm... What to choose...${prompt};Oh, mon Dieu... Il y en a tellement à choisir ! Je ne sais pas quoi choisir. Au fait, est-ce que ça me va bien ?${prompt}
Oh, I love jewelry. I could stay and look at diamonds all day long. Why don't men understand?${prompt};"Je ne pense pas. J'ai besoin de quelque chose qui ressorte et crie ""moi"". Hmm... Que choisir...${prompt}"
Why do women always go gaga over diamonds? I don't get it at all.${prompt};Oh, j'adore les bijoux. Je pourrais rester là et regarder des diamants toute la journée. Pourquoi les hommes ne comprennent-ils pas ?${prompt}
She's having fun, so that's fine. I just wish she'd hurry up and pick something out already!${prompt};Pourquoi les femmes s'extasient-elles toujours sur les diamants ? Je ne comprends pas du tout.${prompt}
Goblins run this shop, but don't worry. They're not hostile. I guess they're not all the same...${prompt};Elle s'amuse, alors c'est bien. J'aimerais juste qu'elle se dépêche de choisir quelque chose !${prompt}
I like diversity, but I get chills just stepping in there. Still, they carry things you can't find anywhere else.${prompt};Des gobelins tiennent cette boutique, mais ne vous inquiétez pas. Ils ne sont pas hostiles. Je suppose qu'ils ne sont pas tous pareils...${prompt}
This shop's famous among locals for the three beautiful women behind the counter. Which one's my favorite? Well, that's a secret.${prompt};J'aime la diversité, mais j'ai des frissons juste en y entrant. Pourtant, ils ont des choses que vous ne pouvez trouver nulle part ailleurs.${prompt}
I wonder which one is the prettiest from a woman's standpoint...${prompt};Ce magasin est célèbre parmi les habitants pour les trois belles femmes derrière le comptoir. Laquelle est ma préférée ? Eh bien, c'est un secret.${prompt}
Hmm... So you prefer classical beauty. Don't tell anyone, but I like her the best, too.${prompt};Je me demande laquelle est la plus jolie du point de vue d'une femme...${prompt}
Whoa, so you go for older women, huh? You like a lady who takes charge... Well, she is stunning.${prompt};Hmm... Donc, vous préférez la beauté classique. Ne le dites à personne, mais je l'aime aussi le mieux.${prompt}
Wow, so you're into the pure and innocent type, huh? Yeah, she sure is cute.${prompt};Whoa, donc vous aimez les femmes plus âgées, hein ? Vous aimez une dame qui prend les choses en main... Eh bien, elle est superbe.${prompt}
I must never-ever tell a soul. No one can know how fat I looked when I bought a size too small...${prompt};Wow, donc vous êtes attiré par le type pur et innocent, hein ? Ouais, elle est vraiment mignonne.${prompt}
Huh? No! I didn't mean that! See, I bought something I couldn't wear for my current job! You always have to watch out for that, you know. Ahahaha!${prompt};Je ne dois jamais, jamais révéler cela à qui que ce soit. Personne ne peut savoir à quel point j'avais l'air gros quand j'ai acheté une taille trop petite...${prompt}
Collet hasn't been to school in ages! I hope she's doing okay.${prompt};Hein ? Non ! Je ne voulais pas dire ça ! Voyez-vous, j'ai acheté quelque chose que je ne pouvais pas porter pour mon travail actuel ! Vous devez toujours faire attention à ça, vous savez. Ahahaha !${prompt}
Galmut always tells herrr, “Leave it to me.” But what could it be? I do hope she comes back soon.${prompt};Collet n'est pas allée à l'école depuis des lustres ! J'espère qu'elle va bien.${prompt}
Would you like to see a map of Jeuno?${prompt};Galmut lui dit toujours, “Laisse-moi faire.” Mais que pourrait-ce être ? J'espère qu'elle revient bientôt.${prompt}
See a map of Jeuno?;Voulez-vous voir une carte de Jeuno ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Voulez-vous voir une carte de Jeuno ?
Show me.;
I'm fine.${prompt};Montrez-moi.
We're currently standing in Lower Jeuno, the third level from the top.${prompt};Ça va.${prompt}
I used to watch the harbor filled with ships. But ever since the airships came, those days are gone.${prompt};Nous nous trouvons actuellement dans Lower Jeuno, le troisième niveau depuis le sommet.${prompt}
Progress is a good thing, but it's still sad.${prompt};Autrefois, je regardais le port rempli de bateaux. Mais depuis l'arrivée des aéronefs, ces jours sont révolus.${prompt}
I'm searching for the perfect fishing spot. Thing is, I've been looking so long, I don't have time to fish!${prompt};Le progrès est une bonne chose, mais c'est quand même triste.${prompt}
I bought a home here in Jeuno, but I wish I'd known about that awful bar downstairs. Every night those bards carouse till dawn. What am I to do?${prompt};Je suis à la recherche de l'endroit de pêche parfait. Le problème, c'est que je cherche depuis si longtemps que je n'ai pas le temps de pêcher !${prompt}
Jeuno's a special city. We're a melting pot of all different kinds of people. I love this town.${prompt};J'ai acheté une maison ici à Jeuno, mais j'aurais aimé savoir pour ce terrible bar en bas. Chaque nuit, ces bardes font la fête jusqu'à l'aube. Que puis-je faire ?${prompt}
Of course, sometimes we fail to understand how different we all are. That's just the kind of thing we need to avoid.${prompt};Jeuno est une ville spéciale. Nous sommes un melting-pot de toutes sortes de gens différents. J'adore cette ville.${prompt}
I like to stand here and watch you people rrrun back and forth all day. I wonder what the hurry is...${prompt};Bien sûr, parfois, nous échouons à comprendre à quel point nous sommes tous différents. C'est juste le genre de chose que nous devons éviter.${prompt}
Sometimes you should slow down and walk for a change. You know, stop and smell the rrroses!${prompt};J'aime me tenir ici et regarder les gens courir de long en large toute la journée. Je me demande quelle est la précipitation...${prompt}
Good day, and welcome to Lower Jeuno. Our neighborhood is the city's premier retail destination, handling a broad range of merchandise.${prompt};Parfois, vous devriez ralentir et marcher pour changer. Vous savez, vous arrêter et sentir les roses !${prompt}
We hope you enjoy the unique shopping experience of Lower Jeuno. What, you were expecting someone younger? Away with you!${prompt};Bonjour et bienvenue à Lower Jeuno. Notre quartier est la destination commerciale de premier choix de la ville, offrant une large gamme de marchandises.${prompt}
To me, the auction's like a game of wits between me and the other bidders.${prompt};Nous espérons que vous apprécierez l'expérience de shopping unique de Lower Jeuno. Quoi, vous vous attendiez à quelqu'un de plus jeune ? Allez-vous-en !${prompt}
You always have to keep tabs on what you really want, and how much you want to pay for it. It's so easy to get carried away!${prompt};Pour moi, la vente aux enchères est comme un jeu d'intelligence entre moi et les autres enchérisseurs.${prompt}
When I was but a lass, I oft would follow my lover to this fountain. He would speak barely a word, so shy was he!${prompt};Vous devez toujours surveiller ce que vous voulez vraiment et combien vous êtes prêt à payer pour cela. Il est si facile de se laisser emporter !${prompt}
To love someone is a wonderful thing. Only now, at my age, does that seem so clear.${prompt};Quand j'étais jeune fille, je suivais souvent mon amoureux jusqu'à cette fontaine. Il ne disait presque rien, tellement il était timide !${prompt}
Oh, my husband? Yes, he's quite well. He's so full of life, I know not what to do!${prompt};Aimer quelqu'un est une chose merveilleuse. Ce n'est que maintenant, à mon âge, que cela semble si clair.${prompt}
You must examine all the advertisements to find the very best deals!${prompt};Oh, mon mari ? Oui, il va très bien. Il est tellement plein de vie, je ne sais pas quoi faire !${prompt}
Little may be the difference between these shops, but ever am I thrilled to save some gil. Oh, such a miser am I!${prompt};Vous devez examiner toutes les annonces pour trouver les meilleures offres !${prompt}
Your inventory capacity has increased.${prompt};Il peut y avoir peu de différence entre ces magasins, mais je suis toujours ravi d'économiser quelques gils. Oh, je suis si avare !${prompt}
Now offering quick and easy delivery of packages to residences everywhere!${prompt};Votre capacité d'inventaire a augmenté.${prompt}
You don't deserve no bigger bag...yet.${prompt};Offre maintenant une livraison rapide et facile de colis à toutes les résidences !${prompt}
I instruct Tenshodo members in the way of the fist and foot. In their line of work, there are times they must defend themselves, you see.${prompt};Vous ne méritez pas un sac plus grand... pour l'instant.${prompt}
I'd watch out if I were you. Stick your nose into places you don't belong, and you could find yourself in trouble.${prompt};J'enseigne aux membres de Tenshodo la voie du poing et du pied. Dans leur domaine, il arrive parfois qu'ils doivent se défendre, vous comprenez.${prompt}
Well, well... I see you have attained your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. But you still need more training, child. You must seek the rank of ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Je ferais attention si j'étais vous. Mettez votre nez là où vous ne devriez pas, et vous pourriez vous retrouver dans des ennuis.${prompt}
When you are ready, I will test you. If you prove yourself worthy of promotion, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} will be yours.${prompt};Eh bien, eh bien... Je vois que vous avez obtenu votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Mais vous avez encore besoin de plus d’entraînement, jeune enfant. Vous devez atteindre le grade de ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Are you ready for the test?;Quand vous serez prêt, je vous testerai. Si vous vous révélez digne de la promotion, le ${item-singular: 1[2]} sera à vous.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Êtes-vous prêt pour le test ?
Bring it on.;
No, not yet.${prompt};Que ça commence.
Very good, child. A true martial artist always conquers fear. Defeat the following opponents in mortal combat, and bring me proof of their demise.${prompt};Non, pas encore.${prompt}
Slay a nue for its ${item-singular: 2[2]}, a morbolger for its ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and a deadly dodo for its ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Gather these and bring them to me.${prompt};Très bien, mon enfant. Un véritable artiste martial surmonte toujours la peur. Terrassez les adversaires suivants dans un combat mortel et apportez-moi la preuve de leur disparition.${prompt}
Only then will you be worthy of promotion. Now, go!${prompt};Tuez un nue pour son ${item-singular: 2[2]}, un morbolger pour son ${item-singular: 3[2]}, et un dodo mortel pour son ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Rassemblez-les et apportez-les-moi.${prompt}
What are you afraid of? The true martial artist does not fear.${prompt};Seulement alors serez-vous digne de promotion. Allez maintenant !${prompt}
Oh... The circle is now complete. Wear this ${item-singular: 1[2]} with pride and honor. Always remember the trials you faced to claim it.${prompt};De quoi avez-vous peur ? Le véritable artiste martial ne craint pas.${prompt}
Perhaps one day we can face each other in open-hand combat. A glorious fight that would be, don't you think?${prompt};Oh... Le cercle est maintenant complet. Portez ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} avec fierté et honneur. N’oubliez jamais les épreuves que vous avez affrontées pour le récupérer.${prompt}
You call yourself ${name-player}? Well, I've never heard of you. You may be somebody in your little hometown, but things are different here.${prompt};Peut-être qu'un jour nous pourrons nous affronter en combat à mains nues. Un combat glorieux, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
All roads lead to Jeuno. It's not easy to make a name for yourself with all these people here.${prompt};Vous vous appelez ${name-player} ? Eh bien, je n'ai jamais entendu parler de vous. Vous êtes peut-être quelqu'un dans votre petite ville, mais les choses sont différentes ici.${prompt}
If you're really so famous back home, then word should reach here eventually. For now, just finish what you've started. Fame and fortune should follow.${prompt};Tous les chemins mènent à Jeuno. Ce n'est pas facile de se faire un nom avec tous ces gens ici.${prompt}
${name-player}, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar...${prompt};Si vous êtes vraiment si célèbre chez vous, alors tôt ou tard, le mot devrait parvenir ici. Pour l'instant, terminez simplement ce que vous avez commencé. La gloire et la fortune suivront.${prompt}
But I'm afraid few in this town have heard of you. Just keep working at it. You'll make a name for yourself eventually.${prompt};${name-player}, hein ? Hmm... Ce nom me dit vaguement quelque chose...${prompt}
Oh, so you're ${name-player}... Yes, I heard some travelers in a tavern talk about you. It seems you've a fair reputation.${prompt};Mais j'ai bien peur que peu de gens dans cette ville n'aient entendu parler de vous. Continuez simplement. Vous vous ferez un nom tôt ou tard.${prompt}
If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more Jeunoans will come seeking your help. Good luck.${prompt};Oh, donc vous êtes ${name-player}... Oui, j'ai entendu quelques voyageurs dans une taverne parler de vous. Il semble que vous ayez une bonne réputation.${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days. You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.${prompt};Si vous continuez à faire ce que vous faites, je suis sûr que davantage de Jeunoans viendront chercher votre aide. Bonne chance.${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}! A good deal of people here in Jeuno know about you!${prompt};Bonjour, ${name-player} ! J'entends votre nom mentionné assez souvent ces jours-ci. Vous avez bien réussi, mon ami. Continuez comme ça.${prompt}
And they all say you're quite the do-gooder! Thank you for serving our fair city. Keep up the good work!${prompt};Bonjour, ${name-player} ! Un bon nombre de personnes ici à Jeuno connaissent votre nom !${prompt}
Why, it's ${name-player}! Your growing reputation precedes you.${prompt};Et ils disent tous que vous êtes un vrai bienfaiteur ! Merci de servir notre belle ville. Continuez votre bon travail !${prompt}
We hope your already substantial contributions to our humble city will continue to grow with time.${prompt};Tiens, voilà ${name-player} ! Votre réputation grandissante vous précède.${prompt}
Why, hello, ${name-player}. I say, literally everyone in Jeuno knows your name.${prompt};Nous espérons que vos contributions déjà substantielles à notre modeste ville continueront de croître avec le temps.${prompt}
It is my pleasure to inform you how impressed we are with your service to Jeuno. We hope to see more of your commendable generosity in the future!${prompt};Tiens, bonjour, ${name-player}. Je vous assure, littéralement tout le monde à Jeuno connaît votre nom.${prompt}
${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}! To all citizens here, your name is synonymous with courage and sacrifice. Not a day goes by without hearing of your saintlike service to Jeuno.${prompt};C'est avec plaisir que je vous informe combien nous sommes impressionnés par votre service à Jeuno. Nous espérons voir davantage de votre générosité louable à l'avenir !${prompt}
I speak for all of Jeuno when I express my sincerest appreciation for your generosity. Indeed, bards shall sing of your virtues for ages to come!${prompt};${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Dame] ${name-player} ! Pour tous les citoyens d'ici, votre nom est synonyme de courage et de sacrifice. Pas un jour ne se passe sans entendre parler de votre service quasi-saint à Jeuno.${prompt}
Welcome to the auction house.;Je parle au nom de tout Jeuno lorsque j'exprime ma sincère appréciation pour votre générosité. En effet, les bardes chanteront vos vertus pour les siècles à venir !${prompt}
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};Bienvenue à la maison des enchères.
What do you want to know?;Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que voulez-vous savoir ?
What is the auction house?;
How are auctions run?;Qu'est-ce que la maison des enchères ?
Are there any fees?;Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
Are there any limits?;Y a-t-il des frais ?
How do you check up on merchandise?;Y a-t-il des limites ?
How do you remove an item?;Comment vérifiez-vous les marchandises ?
My “Sales Status” list is full!;Comment supprimez-vous un article ?
Nothing right now.${prompt};"Ma liste de ""Statut des ventes"" est pleine !"
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};Les maisons de vente aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les principales villes de Vana'diel. C'est là que les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les vieilles armures... presque tout.${prompt}
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};Actuellement, les maisons de vente aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix diffèrent d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de vente aux enchères, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou plus achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};Une fois mis en vente aux enchères, un article restera là pendant un maximum de trente semaines, temps Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi, temps terrestre).${prompt}
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};Si un article ne se vend pas dans ce délai, il sera renvoyé à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis en vente aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles simples et les articles empilables.${prompt}
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsque n'importe quelle marchandise est mise en vente aux enchères. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};Le Comité international des maisons de vente aux enchères, ou CIHVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles pouvaient être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};Cependant, le CIHVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles qu'une personne peut acheter.${prompt}
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};Un petit laps de temps est nécessaire avant que de nouveaux articles n'apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};"Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste ""Statut des ventes"", il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement sur la liste des enchères.

Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/sweetie]... You helped me out big time, but there ain't nothing more I can make for you.${prompt};
Do you have the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?;
Vauderame asked for you...?${prompt};
Wait in that room over there.;
Everyone will be here momentarily.${prompt};
Well, ladies and gentlemen, are we all here?;
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Vauderame.${prompt};
I don't possess a talent for witty repartee as do most of my fellow Elvaan, so I will get straight to the point.${prompt};
Firstly, I wonder if you have heard of the group known as Atarefaunet's band?${prompt};
Also known as the Scarlet Thunder of La Theine, rrright?${prompt};
The Scarlet what?${prompt};
A bit before your time, young one? You need to study more.${prompt};
It was a group of thieves that once terrorized merchants on the roads between San d'Oria, Bastok, and Jeuno, stealing damn huge amounts of money and goods.${prompt};
...Traveling merchants would quake in fear at the mere mention of that damn name...${prompt};
It would seem the veterans among you are well-versed in thieving history.${prompt};
During the Great War, the leader of the band, Atarefaunet, was killed by a traitor and the rest of the members scattered to the winds.${prompt};
However, the Tenshodo has managed to divine the current whereabouts of the remaining members.${prompt};
The task I have called you here for today is to deliver a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to each of the thieves of Atarefaunet's band.${prompt};
Why would you want us to do that? Do you mean to bring them together to form a new thieving group?;
...Damn!${prompt};
No, of course not.;
What could thieves of twenty years ago accomplish now?${prompt};
Nevertheless, it would not be wise to leave them to their own devices. It's possible that some amongst them might seek to regain the glory of the past.${prompt};
The Tenshodo simply wishes to measure their intentions. If those members plan on beginning any activities, we ask that they inform us about it.${prompt};
...That is the main point of the message in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
However, it is not certain that they will just meekly sign the papers. My job is to make certain these brigands follow the will of the Tenshodo.${prompt};
And that is where you come in. Use your knowledge and talents to get those signatures and bring them back here to me.${prompt};
I will now hand each of you a sealed envelope. Seek out the member whose name is revealed therein.${prompt};
Lastly, it is against thieving etiquette to sneak a look at the members assigned to people other than yourself. As I'm sure you are aware, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing in this business...${prompt};
Now, please come to me one at a time to receive your envelope.${prompt};
You are the adventurer thief ${name-player}?${prompt};
Since you are an adventurer, I will give you the member who requires the most muscle to deal with. Go and meet with the Galka staying at the inn located in the town of Selbina.${prompt};
You have completed your assignment?${prompt};
Vauderame is waiting for you in the same room as before. Go and present your report.${prompt};
It appears the Galka gave you some trouble, as I expected.;
Your face tells of trying times.${prompt};
I'm ba-ack!${prompt};
Ah, Nanaa Mihgo, that makes everyone.${prompt};
Now, ${name-player}.;
Gather everyone together. It's time to begin.${prompt};
I thank you all for flawlessly completing the task I set.${prompt};
As a reward, I will give each of you a weapon designed specifically for thieves. Please come to me one at a time.${prompt};
Hey, we don't trust you people none, but we can always smell a profit!${prompt};
Hey, daredevil... You lookin' for Pauluart? He comes here lots.${prompt};
Let's roll some dice. Loser gets to see Pauluart and get killed.${prompt};
Roll the dice?;
${selection-lines};
Let's do it.;
Just a minute.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!;
${color-alt: 121}Sniggnix rolls the die and gets a ${number: 3}!;
Here's your chance. Go to Dangruf Wadi and find Dangruf brothers. They have ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Uh-oh.${prompt};
That ain't good.${prompt};
You got ${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
If you have that die, you win against Pauluart.${prompt};
If you lose, say, “Smaller number wins.”${prompt};
Wait outside. I go get Pauluart and come back.${prompt};
You were looking for me?${prompt};
You call yourself ${name-player}?;
I have no memory of that name. What do you want with me?${prompt};
...You want my signature again?;
This is most irregular. How embarrassing for the Tenshodo to have to go over the same ground twice. Doesn't exactly inspire faith now, does it?${prompt};
...Nevertheless, I have been given this opportunity to be out here in the fresh air and speak with people after being cooped up inside for such a long time. Let's leave it up to this impartial die to decide whether this encounter was a fortunate one or not.${prompt};
I see you are carrying dice as well. If you say you are here without guile, then roll the die. It will judge your innocence.${prompt};
However...;
If the die judges you have evil intent, this knife will carry out your sentence...${prompt};
You can't escape. You are now in the hands of Fate.;
Life. Death. Everything rests on the roll of the die.${prompt};
If you beat my die, then victory is yours.;
Now, roll.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!;
This is ominous.;
You appear to be quite the villain. Now it is my turn. Please hand me the die.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Pauluart rolls the die and gets 789!;
Ahahaha!;
I win! Your die has judged you unworthy. Prepare to receive your sentence.${prompt};
Yell out?;
${selection-lines};
The smaller number wins!${prompt};
...What?;
Huh? This die...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}...;
...Ah, this is...;
Sniggnix, you've been telling secrets again.${prompt};
You win this time.;
I suppose I'll sign the papers for you.;
It's a shame, for I had hoped to feel the warmth of fresh blood again...${prompt};
Please send my friends my regards. And to your friends also.;
You rolled lower number, right?;
This die, also called “Sinner's Die.”;
When you roll that die, they tell the weight of your sins.${prompt};
Pauluart's sins, far greater than yours.;
He has no right to judge your guilt.${prompt};
Move it, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/lady]. I'm not here for you.${prompt};
Yeah, I remember you.;
You heard the rumor that Atarefaunet's band hid their treasure in that damn Garlaige Citadel?${prompt};
...That's not why you're here?;
You've got something to ask me? Well, then you'd better damn well get it over with. I'm a busy man.${prompt};
And if I tell you? There's no profit to be had in sticking your damn nose into finished business, friend.${prompt};
Alright then.;
I guess that's your damn problem. If you get me some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, then I'll help you.${prompt};
Here's the damn deal.;
Bring me four ${item-plural: 1[2]} that alchemists are said to make. Then we'll talk.${prompt};
Don't make me repeat myself, dammit!;
I want four ${item-plural: 1[2]} that the alchemists make. Then we have a deal.${prompt};
I thought about joining in on the hunt for the treasure...;
It's almost definitely hidden in that damn Garlaige Citadel somewhere.${prompt};
You got them!;
I couldn't make the damn things myself.${prompt};
Now I can get my work done. And eat some damn good food.${prompt};
...Now, to answer your damn question.;
The signature on my papers was an “O.”${prompt};
I don't know what you're planning, but be damn careful. That Vauderame isn't a man you mess with lightly.${prompt};
If I didn't have this damn assignment, I would have joined in on the treasure hunt. Things happen for a reason, I guess.${prompt};
Remember this.;
Thieves' work and adventuring don't go hand in hand. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Damn straight!${prompt};
What? A toolbox that won't open? Oh, yeah... A long time ago I took a strange box from one of Brugaire's warehouses.${prompt};
The box was old and filthy, but I couldn't wait to pry it open and see the treasure inside. But it simply wouldn't open!${prompt};
Wait, are you looking for that box? Hmm... I'll sell it to you for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
Well?;
${selection-lines};
Fine, I'll take it.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not telling you where it is, then!${prompt};
That's the spirit, my fine customer!${prompt};
I left the toolbox on top of a crate outside the Duty-Free shop in Port Jeuno. Till just now I had completely forgotten it!${prompt};
Look, the toolbox is on top of a crate outside of Port Jeuno's Duty-Free shop. Go ahead and take it.${prompt};
Hey, what are you tryin' to pull? Get lost!${prompt};
Sorry, I'm busy. Something awful has happened, and it'll take one helluva beastmaster to sort it out.${prompt};
Perfect timing! We were hoping to find a renowned beastmaster like you to take care of a little problem.${prompt};
You see, the beasts who inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like they're under someone's control. They've attacked adventurers, and recently killed one!${prompt};
People suspect we beastmasters have something to do with it. You should know we'd never do anything like that. Won't you look into this for us?${prompt};
You see, the beasts that inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like someone or something is controlling them. Could you look into it for us?${prompt};
Will you help us?;
${selection-lines};
Of course I will.;
Not right now.${prompt};
I knew you would! Many skilled beastmasters have gone, but none have returned. Maybe they've fallen to whatever is controlling the beasts!${prompt};
Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to protect yourself. Ask Osker in the stables in Upper Jeuno to help you.${prompt};
You're the only one we can turn to! Please come back as soon as you can.${prompt};
So you've got ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Good work! You will know when to use it. Now, to the Eldieme Necropolis!${prompt};
So that was what was happening. I'm happy that the honor of beastmasters has been cleared. On behalf of everyone here, I thank you.${prompt};
Pets are precious to beastmasters. I almost lost one, so I know how it feels. ${prompt};
The other night I dreamed I was riding my old chocobo across the plains. Brutus told me he'd let me see it again, and I can't wait!${prompt};
The other day I was finally able to ride my old chocobo... It was like, well, a dream come true. I never remembered riding to be so exciting.${prompt};
Ahhhhhh-choo!;
Excuse me. I think I caught myself a cold riding that old girl all night. My son's been taking care of me since morning.${prompt};
I don't know how to thank you for all you've done for me. I think I'll take me some of that great medicine you got for my son and get back into bed. Be seeing you!;
<Cough-cough!>${prompt};
Look at you, a true bard! Me? I think I've finally recovered from the pain of rejection.${prompt};
I couldn't bring myself to throw away the bracelet she gave me, but maybe now is the time.${prompt};
It breaks my heart to cast it away! Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt};
I can't throw away the bracelet she gave me. Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt};
Could you throw it away for me?;
${selection-lines};
Oh, I suppose.;
No, do it yourself.${prompt};
Thank you! But this gift is too precious to toss into the garbage... I know! Could you cast it into the Waters of Oblivion at Ranguemont Pass?${prompt};
Good luck, and don't just dump it at some auction house, all right?${prompt};
Hmm... Maybe you're right. But I don't think I can bring myself to do it!${prompt};
It's too precious to throw into the garbage. No, it needs a more peaceful resting place, like the Water of Oblivion in Ranguemont Pass.${prompt};
You threw it in? Thank you! My heart feels at peace, knowing that my ordeal is behind me. Please, take this in thanks.${prompt};
Perhaps everything is as full of memories as that bracelet... Should someone find it a hundred years hence, what shall they feel?${prompt};
Yes, maybe such feelings do not diminish with the flow of time. Oh, what a moving thought!${prompt};
Perhaps my heartfelt pain will live on in my song. Such is the life of a bard!${prompt};
Say, I see you're quite a bard now. I'm looking for a bard, you see...${prompt};
I thought you'd be a perfect match for this task. What do you say?${prompt};
Interested?;
${selection-lines};
You bet.;
Spare me.${prompt};
Thank goodness! Listen, it's such an onerous task that nobody wants to do it. I'm so lucky you're here!${prompt};
Well, for starters, you'll need to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Can't do much without one.${prompt};
Oh, you're busy, huh? Well, who am I supposed to ask now? Bards like you don't exactly grow on trees, you know!${prompt};
Say, how about that task I told you about?${prompt};
Good, this will do nicely. Now for the task! I want you to visit the grave of a great bard of yesteryear and pray for him.${prompt};
"Why, you ask? I don't know; it's just something we always do. They say he met a tragic end. Go ask other bards if you want to learn about him.${prompt}";
His stone sarcophagus is deep inside the Eldieme Necropolis. It's one of several, and I can't remember which. Well, you'll find it.${prompt};
A little investigation will reveal which one is his. Purify it with that ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem. You don't know the tune? It's okay, just go!${prompt};
Huh? The bard interred inside Eldieme? Yeah, he was executed in San d'Oria for committing a serious crime!${prompt};
So you're off to pray at his grave, huh? Be careful! You never know what evil lurks in those halls!${prompt};
Oh, did you take the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and play the requiem? The task isn't complete until you've done both!${prompt};
Good work, ${name-player}! Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you about the monsters. Otherwise nobody would go! Understand?${prompt};
Huh? After that a man came and gave you a ring? I hope he wasn't a grave robber!${prompt};
"But don't give that ring to me; I hate antiques. Anyway, here's your reward. Thanks again!${prompt}";
Well, that's out of the way. Now who should I ask for the next task? Bards can be so selfish sometimes!${prompt};
So, what did you do with that ring? Maybe it's valuable. I'd ask a collector if I were you. Of course, he might just say it's worthless...${prompt};
You have emerged as a hero to the people of Jeuno. Just the sound of your name strikes courage into their hearts.${prompt};
As a representative of its citizens, I humbly ask you to continue your efforts for the good of the Duchy.${prompt};
Good luck, ${choice: 0}[citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.${prompt};
I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1.;
I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.${prompt};
Since we are allied with San d'Oria...${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Since we are allied with Bastok...${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Since we are allied with Windurst...${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
I am sorry.;
I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.${prompt};
Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly.;
I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.${prompt};
You've earned conquest points!${prompt};
You've received your nation's Signet.;
You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!${prompt};
I am ${name-npc}, a Temple Knight.;
I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.${prompt};
I am ${name-npc}, an Iron Musketeer.;
I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.${prompt};
I am ${name-npc}, a War Warlock.;
I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.${prompt};
What is your business?;
${selection-lines};
Would you cast Signet on me?;
I want to spend my conquest points.;
${choice: 0}[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.];
I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F.;
I want to go on a supplies quest.;
I have some questions...;
Nothing, sorry to bother you.${prompt};
What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Conquests.;
Conquest results.;
Donating crystals.;
Conquest points.;
The effects of controlling regions.;
Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};
Where do you wish to take the supplies?;

Like I told you in Norg, I haven't seen Verena. After you met her in Castle Oztroja, she came back here and locked herself in her room.${prompt};
I thought I would give her some time to herself, but when I went to check up on her, she had already gone. If you hear anything, please let me know.${prompt};
Verena's whereabouts? Well, Lion was just here...${prompt};
Aldo!${prompt};
I think I might know where Verena is.${prompt};
Are you certain?${prompt};
Yes. I saw a group of Ducal Guards, led by Captain Wolfgang, taking her away somewhere.${prompt};
Wolfgang?;
Then Kam'lanaut must be behind this.${prompt};
But wait, there's more. I've heard that Wolfgang took Verena to Delkfutt's Tower. You're coming, right, Aldo?${prompt};
I'll be ready in the blink of an eye. Somebody's going to be sorry they ever laid a finger on her!${prompt};
And that's the story.${prompt};
This is the last time I'll be made a fool of by that Kam'lanaut. If he lays a finger on Verena...;
The last time I was this angry, I...${prompt};
Oh, it's you. I see that you made it out of there alive.${prompt};
Me? I'm fine, but Verena's been unconscious since we returned. Come with me.${prompt};
From what I see, her mind's been poisoned. I never knew that Eald'narche had that kind of power...${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I hardly know anything about him.${prompt};
I guess I never really thought that I needed to know. If I got what I wanted, I was happy.${prompt};
Al...do...${prompt};
Verena!;
Do you know who I am, Verena?${prompt};
Aldo? Yes, I'm alright...${prompt};
So, do you...do you remember what happened in the Stellar Fulcrum?${prompt};
Not really... It was all like watching a play...${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
I was controlled by the...the Shadow Lord's sheer will...${prompt};
You don't have to say any more. It's all over now. And I thank the heavens that you're back here safe with me.${prompt};
Aldo...${prompt};
I appreciate you traveling here, ${name-player}. However, I don't know if I can carry on this game with Eald'narche anymore.${prompt};
Listen, ${name-player}. The other day...${prompt};
What should I...;
If we don't act quickly...${prompt};
Aah! I don't know if I can carry on this game with Eald'narche anymore.${prompt};
Uncle Aldo!${prompt};
I told you kids a thousand times, you're not to be coming around here. If you're looking for Verena, she can't come out right now.${prompt};
Fickie's...Fickie's seeds...;
They've sprouty-wouted!${prompt};
What do you mean? There is no way those seeds could grow here in Jeuno...${prompt};
C'mon! We'll show you!${prompt};
Looky-looky! You can't see it, but there's a sprouty-wouty under the soil! It's really-willy growing!${prompt};
The seed we planted--the seed we and Fickie planted--is growing!${prompt};
Well, I'll be...${prompt};
Aldo...${prompt};
Verena. The seed you planted with Fickblix has begun to sprout. These kids must have taken real good care of it.${prompt};
What you and Fickblix tried to do...maybe it wasn't all a lost cause.${prompt};
I'm so sorry, Fickblix...;
I've been caught up in my own troubles recently, and haven't come to check on these seeds.${prompt};
It sprouted! I knew that if everybody pitched in, it would grow.${prompt};
Fickblix... But...how?${prompt};
It's still just a sprout, but I know it'll bloom someday. I wish I could water it and feed it, too...${prompt};
...${prompt};
But if everybody keeps working hard, it will bloom. It will!${prompt};
Yes, Fickblix. It will bloom. We will make sure that it does.${prompt};
Well, I've got to go now, but I'm not sad anymore. What is that phrase you taught me, Verena?${prompt};
Yeah, “thank you.” That's the first phrase you taught me when I came here.${prompt};
We beastmen don't have a word for “thank you,” but I like that phrase a lot. I wanted to teach it to all my beastmen friends...${prompt};
Thank you, everybody...${prompt};
Fickblix!!!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
I'm so sorry, Fickblix...;
If I only had the courage that you had...;
I can't do anything...${prompt};
Verena...${prompt};
If Fickblix believed he could get those seeds to grow, then I have to believe there is something I can do.${prompt};
You just wait, Eald'narche! I'm not going to let you stand in our way!${prompt};
Hold up there, ${name-player}. Where's Aldo? You didn't just leave him on that cursed island to die, did you?${prompt};
If anything has happened to our boss, don't even think you'll be leaving here alive!${prompt};
What's with the long faces? You guys look like you just got back from a funeral!${prompt};
Boss!${prompt};
You're...still alive!${prompt};
Did you really think that I, the great Aldo, would flop at the hands of a couple worms like those Zilart?${prompt};
It wasn't easy, but thanks to ${name-player} here, the princes were no match for us!${prompt};
Thanks again, ${name-player}. You did really well up there.${prompt};

But now, look at you. You've matured into a fine adventurer.${prompt};
Not as fine as yours truly...but close.${prompt};
Aldo!${prompt};
Verena!${prompt};
Miss Verena!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Aldo, you're all right!;
I've been praying every moment of every day for your safe return.${prompt};
I'm sorry I kept you worrying.${prompt};
But... Where's Lion? Is she here, or did she go back to Norg?${prompt};
Verena...;
Lion's...gone.${prompt};
What do you mean, gone?${prompt};
Lion... Lion traded her life to stop Eald'narche's plan...${prompt};
No!${prompt};
She can't be... She just can't be gone! What did she do to deserve this!?${prompt};
Verena....;
Lion fought bravely that day. Her sacrifice saved millions of lives.${prompt};
So what!? Nothing we say can bring her back! She's...${prompt};
Why does everyone have to suffer!? What did Lion--what did Fickblix do to deserve their pain? I don't want to forget what they went through...${prompt};
I'm sorry, Verena.${prompt};
...?${prompt};
I-I can feel something... This warmth... Lion? Is that you?${prompt};
It is you, isn't it...${prompt};
Aldo, Lion is still alive. I can feel it. She's weaker than before, but she's still with us.${prompt};
You may be right, Verena. And if there's any shred of hope, the least we can do is continue to believe.${prompt};
So, ${name-player}.${prompt};
As much as I'd love you to join us here at the Tenshodo, I think I already know your answer to that offer. But if you're ever in the neighborhood, be sure to drop by. You're always welcome.${prompt};
Well, I think it's time I took that vacation I've been promising myself. You should go someplace quiet and get some rest as well.;
I have a feeling that the real adventure has just begun...${prompt};
A lot has happened in the past few months... I don't know how long the news of the archduke and his brother is going to stay a secret, but that has nothing to do with me or the Tenshodo.${prompt};
What to do now? Maybe I'll get myself a boat and sail around Vana'diel...;
Good luck on your journeys, ${name-player}, and may fortune smile upon you always!${prompt};
Welcome one, welcome all to the humble abode of Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru!${prompt};
Wait...;
I can sense that you are troubled spiritually, and that is why you came here today.${prompt};
Hm?${prompt};
Hey! What's up, baby-baby?${prompt};
Runga-Kopunga! What brings you here?${prompt};
Runga-Kopunga?${prompt};
Baby-baby! You know why I'm here. Have you thought about what I said last night?${prompt};
Last nightaru...;
I was flattered, but...${prompt};
What he said last nightaru?${prompt};
Oh, baby-baby! We've gotta go go go for it!${prompt};
Don't keep me hangin' on the line of a yo-yo-yo. You've got to take action on my reaction! Think of the possibilities I can offer!${prompt};
(What does he mean, “go go go for it”? Is he going to take Chululu away...?)${prompt};
You know, you are rightaru! I'm getting tired of the same old same old.${prompt};
Ba～by-baby! That's what I wanted to hear. I'll be waiting for you at...you-know-where. Ta-taru!${prompt};
(No... It couldn't be... Elope...? No... But... I've got to stop her!)${prompt};
(But...how? Chululu won't listen to me...)${prompt};
(But I can't just letaru her run off with some guy...)${prompt};
Um... Hypothetically speaking, if you loved someone, and that someone was about to go far, far away, what would you do? Would you tell ${choice-player-gender}[her/him] that you loved ${choice-player-gender}[her/him]? Hypothetically speaking, of course.${prompt};
Would you express your lovey-wuvy?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
I couldn't...${prompt};
Wowzy... You are a braver ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] than I.${prompt};
I mean...hypothetically speaking, of course. I was just wondering. This has nothing to do with me.${prompt};
I knew it! That's exactly-factly what I would have said! But you know, we would regret it in the long run...${prompt};
(I've got to tell her how I feel... But no... I just couldn't do it...)${prompt};
Oh, what should I do!? I don't want to regretaru not telling her, but what if she laughed at me? I could never-ever face her again!${prompt};
Please, ${name-player}! You've got to go to the Boyahda Tree and get that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! A miracle is my only hope!${prompt};
There is a place deepy-creepy in the Boyahda Tree where the moonlight shines down through the leaves. Legend says that if in that moonlight you offer a prayer to the gods, they will grant you with a single ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, what should I do...? I should just go over there and ask him, but... No, I couldn'taru!${prompt};
Ummm...uh...Chululu... Could I talk to you for, um, a minutaru?${prompt};
This had better be good, Kurou. What if a customer was to come while we were out here chatting away?${prompt};
I...;
I want you to know how...how I feel.${prompt};
How you what!?${prompt};
I've hidden my feelings from you for so long...but now it's time that you know what is in my heartaru.${prompt};
I...;
I want to continue working here with you, side by side. I don't want you to go!${prompt};
I-I love you!${prompt};
So pleasey-weasy reconsider going off with that other man.${prompt};
Going off?;
Other man?;
I don't know what you are talking aboutaru.${prompt};
Don't know...?${prompt};
Hey, baby-baby! Honey-honey!;
Now that I think of it, that “do” is perfect for “you.”${prompt};
Hold on, m-mister! Who do you think you are, getting all chummy-wummy with my Chululu!?${prompt};
Would you control yourself, Kurou! This is my hair stylist, Runga-Kopunga. He's been telling me these past few days that I should get my hair done.${prompt};
I've been trying my best to convince her to let me work my mastery, but she just keeps dissy-dissing me. I envy that buddy-buddy of hers...${prompt};
Her buddy-buddy?${prompt};
Yeah. When they were still little kiddos, somebody told her that he liked her hairstyle--and she hasn't changed it since. I just want to talk to that square and ask him if he could convince Chululu here to let me work my magic on her.${prompt};
Runga-Kopunga! You were supposed to keep that a secretaru!${prompt};
Ha ha ha! Sorry, baby-baby!;
If you ever have second thoughts, I'll be waiting!${prompt};
Y-you see! I wasn't going anywhere!${prompt};
A ha ha... You weren't going anywhere...ha ha...${prompt};
But what you said before... You lov...${prompt};
Oh, yeah, yeah.;
That was just a joke. You get it? Ha ha ha. Pretty funny, rightaru?${prompt};
Hmph! I knew it was a joke. What do you think I am, stupid?;
Well, it wasn't very funny-bunny, but you never did have a sense of humor, now did you?${prompt};
Well, excu～se me!;
By the way, who was that buddy-buddy that hair-boy was talking aboutaru?${prompt};
Well, we know it wasn't you! And why should I tell you, anyway?${prompt};
Wasn't me? Well then, that narrows down the list. The last time I checked, there weren't many people you could call buddy-buddy!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
So, do you think she understood how I feel?${prompt};
How did he do?;
${selection-lines};
Great!;
Terrible!${prompt};
Really-willy?;
Yeah, I'm what they call a “smooth operator.”${prompt};
Terrible, huh?;
But I don't think I could pull off something like that again. Just the thought of it turns my face all reddy-weddy with embarrassment!${prompt};
However, as long as Chululu is working here beside me, I'm as happy as a happy Taru can be!${prompt};
Now, don'taru you go telling Chululu I said that!${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Boy, was I surprised when he told me he...;
But he's always like that. Why can't he just be a little more in touch with his feelings?${prompt};
But to tell you the truth, I was pretty happy-wappy when he finally let the beans outaru of the baggie! But don'taru you go telling Kurou-Morou I said that!${prompt};

Memories new are often born from those forgotten...${prompt};
The easiest way to relive your past is to first cleanse your mind of it.${prompt};
I can assist you in the task of erasing the annals inscribed deep within your soul.${prompt};
...And with this, give you the opportunity to rewrite your history anew.${prompt};
Of course, this path, if you choose to tread it, will not be simple.${prompt};
For a donation of ${number: 7} gil, I will wipe clean your heart of three or four quests, allowing you to once again experience the hardships, the tribulations, and the joy that accompany them.${prompt};
However, it seems your purse is too light. Return again when fortune has smiled upon you.${prompt};
Just as when you first completed them, you will be able to reap the rewards that await you when completing the tasks.${prompt};
However, there are items that fate will not allow you to possess more than one of. If you wish to obtain these items again, you must first cast away those that you still hold on to.${prompt};
Now it is time for you to choose...${prompt};
Which memory do you wish to relive?;
${selection-lines};
I have changed my mind.;
The warrior artifact quests.;
The monk artifact quests.;
The white mage artifact quests.;
The black mage artifact quests.;
The red mage artifact quests.;
The thief artifact quests.;
The paladin artifact quests.;
The dark knight artifact quests.;

The summoner artifact quests.;
The blue mage artifact quests.;

The puppetmaster artifact quests.;
The dancer artifact quests.;

The rune fencer artifact quests.${prompt};
All memories of your former trials will be lost.${prompt};
Are you certain this is what you wish?${prompt};
Have your memories erased?;
${selection-lines};
I need more time to think.;
I have made up my mind.${prompt};
Understood.;
Now close your eyes and relax...${prompt};
All your memories of the ${choice: 0}[???/warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner/blue mage/corsair/puppetmaster/dancer/scholar/geomancer/rune fencer] artifact quests have been erased!${prompt};
What? You want me to tell you about the legendary ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Are you awake? If you think somebody like you can get their hands on a belt so rare, you must still be in dreamland.${prompt};
Only the best of the best are good enough to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, and even then, only the best among those are even allowed to wear one.${prompt};
People call those masters of the martial arts “bushin.” Don't tell me you've never heard of them.${prompt};
As mighty as mountains and as powerful as gods, there are but a handful of bushin left in Vana'diel, but their presence is as great as Altana herself.${prompt};
I've never seen you fight, but I can tell just by looking at your eyes that you don't have what it takes to don a black belt. You'd probably wet your hakama if you even laid eyes on one.${prompt};
What? You think that I'm insulting you?;
Oh well. There's nothing I can say to stop you from taking the truth as an insult.${prompt};
Psst! (Hey you! Yeah, you!);
(My name's Atori-Tutori, and I couldn'taru help overhearing your conversation with the butter-bald guy.)${prompt};
(You say you're looking for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Well, it just so happens I know where you can get your hands on one.)${prompt};
(I can tell you, if you want to know, 'cause I know! You want one, rightaru? Rightaru?)${prompt};
(Listen up, okay? I heard that this prehistorically old guy they call “the bushin” has ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. If you ask him pretty-witty please, he might let you have it!)${prompt};
(Huh? Where's the bushin? Hmmm... I could tell you, I could...)${prompt};
(But what's in it for me? What do I get out of telling you? I'm going to need a little more persuasion on this occasion.)${prompt};
(You know, if somebody brought me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, I guess I could tell them what I have up here in my bitty-brain.)${prompt};
(If they left it here by the door, I could come get it, and WHAM BAM KAZAM! They could be on their way to the bushin.)${prompt};
Wow! I've always wanted one of these thingy-mabobbers!${prompt};
Look at these lovely lines! Look at these curvaceous curves! They remind me of an old girlfriend...but that's another story.${prompt};
You wanted to know about the bushin, rightaru?;
The bushin?;
Bushin...?${prompt};
Ha ha! I was just fooling you. Everybody falls for that one.${prompt};
Now listen up, I heard that the bushin had a disciple--some funky-spunky old geezer. He'd probably know where you could find mister master.${prompt};
I think he lived in Vas...Vost...Boost...Bust...Butt...${prompt};
Bast...ok! Bastok! Yeah, that's where he is.;
What? You thought I was going to tell you where the bushin was? Hah, you simpleton! That would be simply too simple!${prompt};
Wow! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}!${prompt};
When I was young, I never could figure out what was so especially special about these thing-i-ma-doodies, but now...${prompt};
Hm? Hegendard told you that the bushin might show you the black belt if you brought him one of these?${prompt};
What? Degenhard? Are you saying I got his name wrong? No I didn't! He's the one that got his name wrong.;
I don't know any Degenhards, anyway. Someone who doesn't know his own name can't be that great of a fidgety-fighter.${prompt};
Oh yeah, I met with the bushin a couple of days ago. He looked as tip-top tough as always, but the prehistoric guy is getting on in years. He says he's been having terrible trouble with his eyesightaru.${prompt};
So sad...${prompt};
Anyway, he mentioned that he had another disciple--some spickity-spunkity old geezer that likes to pester young adventurers by sending them on quests to go fetch him stuff.${prompt};
If anybody would know what would impress the bushin, it would be him. Why don't you go and search him outaru?${prompt};
Who knows, the bushin might be so impressed that he'd give you the ${item-singular: 0[2]}! (But I wouldn't count on it...)${prompt};
Wow! Wow!;
This is a pretty pretty ${item-singular: 5[2]}! I can see why the bushin would want one of these.${prompt};
You say you got the idea from Maat?${prompt};
Maat...;
Meat...;
Mart...;
Never heard of him. Oh well.${prompt};
If I've never heard of him, then he can't be that super-duper. I bet he's one of those guys that spends their days training by themselves up in the corner of some lonely park.${prompt};
Anyway, anyway.;
You've done good so far. Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and I'll take you to see the bushin. How's that sound?;
What? You don't believe me? The bushin and I are like blood brothers! I can take you to him anytime!${prompt};
I mean, you've already brought him ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. One more petty present and he's sure to hand over his ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Well, what do you know! I knew you were an utterly outrageous adventurer the moment I laid my peepers on you.${prompt};
I'm sorry that I made you run all around. But it's not like you had anything better to do, rightaru?${prompt};
Anyway, here's the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Atori-Tutori is not a man to break his promises.;
Well, ta-taru!${prompt};
What?;
What about my promise to take you to see the bushin?${prompt};
Hmph, you may be tough, but you aren't very brightaru...${prompt};
You've already met him!${prompt};
And I'm not talking about that old geezer!${prompt};
Or that other geezer either!${prompt};
Whatever.;
Maybe you should work on buffing up that miniscule muscle between your ears.;
Bye-bye!${prompt};
Hey Galka, out of my way!;
You're ruining my exitaru!${prompt};
Wait right there!${prompt};
You must be extremely confident or extremely stupid to stroll back into Jeuno like this, ${name-player}.${prompt};
We just received final authorization from your home nation.;
You are under arrest. The charge is treason.${prompt};
How's a man supposed to sit back and enjoy a nice glass of Opo-opo brew with all this commotion? Now is someone going to tell me what is going on here?${prompt};
Aldo, I apologize for my sudden intrusion. We are not here to cause any trouble for your business. We have only come to escort this criminal back to the palace.${prompt};
Criminal?${prompt};
Ah! It's the dead ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]!${prompt};
Hey! It's me! Don't you remember...;
Whoa!;
Wolfgang, Wolfgang, Wolfgang...;
Take a look around you. Does this look like a courthouse? This is my home, and all those in my home are my guests. You wouldn't be calling my guests criminals, now, would you?${prompt};
Aldo, this adventurer is not just some petty thief. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] is suspected of committing treason against the Duchy. If you are thinking of harboring this menace to society, the Ducal Guard will be forced to take action.${prompt};
Action? If you want to see some action, just try laying a finger on one of my guests.${prompt};
Hmph... You never change, Aldo.;
Adventurer! If you know what's good for you, you'll come to the Grand Palace and turn yourself in once you're finished here.${prompt};
And don't even think about running. The warrant for your arrest has already been sent out across Vana'diel. There's nowhere to hide, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Wow, so you are a criminal. Let me guess, they dumped you on Tavnazia as part of your punishment, right?${prompt};
So what did you do? Robbery? Murder? Both...?${prompt};
I see you two know each other.${prompt};
Yeah. This shabby-looking adventurer washed up dead on my private beach. I helped bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] back to life.${prompt};
Hey, wait a minute.;
Aldo, why not ask this ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady]? ${choice-player-gender}[He'll/She'll] tell you I'm not a liar.${prompt};
Alright.;
${name-player}, is it true that a small group of survivors has been living on the southern tip of Tavnazia for the past twenty years?${prompt};
${prompt};
See! Now do you believe me?${prompt};
This thickheaded buffoon wouldn't listen to a word I had to say!${prompt};
Hah! Some strange girl comes breaking down my door, screaming the name of my father, Altana rest his soul--what was I supposed to do?${prompt};
What were you supposed to do? What was I supposed to do?;
The only person I could trust--hell, the only person I knew on the mainland--was Grezzo.${prompt};
He told me that any time I was in trouble, he and the Tenshodo would help me out.${prompt};
But now he's gone and...${prompt};
Oh well, you'll still get us a boat so we can go home, right?${prompt};
Hmmm... That's not going to be as easy as it sounds. I still have nautical maps charting the way to the Sealion's Den, but they're outdated. The currents in that area have changed a lot over the past twenty years...${prompt};
It would take one hell of a navigator to make it to Tavnazia in one piece. But then again, I only employ the best of the best.${prompt};
You may be in luck.;
Just a few days ago, another customer came to me asking to take him to Tavnazia. I was ready to tell him no as well...until I saw the bag of gil he was offering.${prompt};
Another customer? Why would anyone else want to go to Tavnazia?${prompt};
I don't know. I'm not in the business of asking questions, young lady. As long as I get paid, I could care less what he does over there.;
And I don't care if you tag along, but that's not for me to decide. You'll have to get the customer's permission.${prompt};
Oh well. As much as I was looking forward to a private cruise, I guess I can't complain.${prompt};
How thoughtful...${prompt};
And you, ${name-player}. Why don't you go back to Tavnazia as well? You could lay low there for a while until Wolfgang's cooled off.${prompt};
No way!;
${name-player}! If you're a real ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], you'll march your butt up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes!${prompt};
Tough on everyone but yourself, I see...;
Very well. It will take some time to prepare the ship. I will send a messenger when everything is ready. Until then, why don't you take a look around the city?${prompt};
Got it. Thanks, Aldo.${prompt};
Alright! Now it's time to have some fun!${prompt};
See ya, ${name-player}! Maybe we can get together again sometime...if you're still alive!${prompt};
Well, it looks like you should probably turn yourself in. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt};
It looks like you should probably turn yourself in, ${name-player}. This may be the only chance to try and prove your innocence.${prompt};
${name-player}, you weren't thinking of running now, were you? If you know what's good for you, you'll head on up to the Grand Duke Palace and face your crimes.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] I wanted to see.${prompt};
A young lady claiming to be Prishe's acquaintance is here...${prompt};
${name-player}! It is so nice to see you again. Have you not seen Prishe about?${prompt};
Hm? You are searching for her as well?${prompt};
I see...;
You wish to know more of the magicite gem that a peddler from Tavnazia sold to Bastok over thirty years ago...${prompt};
"I do recall hearing stories of the “Star of Tavnazia”; unfortunately, I never actually set my eyes upon it. I do not know what it is, or if the magicite was a piece of it.${prompt}";
Magicite...;
The Star of Tavnazia...${prompt};
?;
Sir Aldo? You would not happen to know anything of the gem, would you?${prompt};
I've heard stories of a mysterious gem kept in the Tavnazian Cathedral. If that relic is also magicite, I wonder in what way it's connected with the other magicite found around Vana'diel...${prompt};
Deep within the Orc, Quadav, and Yagudo strongholds, there are doors that the beastmen guard with their lives. Beyond those doors lie giant crystals emitting a strange, eerie light.${prompt};
If the beastmen were drawn to these crystals and chose those areas to build their towns, then the magicite in the Northlands is more than likely... Hmmm...${prompt};
Perhaps someone in Tavnazia knows something. However, we cannot leave without Prishe. Oh, where could she have wandered off to?${prompt};
Leader!;
That girl! She's been taken to Doctor Monberaux's!${prompt};
What!?;
What happened!?${prompt};
It seems that she was attacked while visiting the Temple of the Goddess!${prompt};
Attacked!?${prompt};
Prishe!;
They say some Elvaan girl was attacked while in the Temple of the Goddess--right in front of the statue of Altana!;
What is this city coming to!?${prompt};
Huh? You think it was a Tenshodo member that did the dirty deed!?;
${name-player}, you'd better watch your tongue unless you want to see it on a plate!${prompt};
That blue-haired girl was taken to Monberaux's after the attack. I'm pretty sure she'll be all right, though. Doctor M. is the best medic in town.${prompt};
You don't need to worry, ${name-player}. Our city's fine doctor is taking care of Prishe as we speak.${prompt};
And as for the fiends that would do something like this, I guarantee you my men and women will find them.${prompt};
If you're looking for Prishe, she and that rich boy Tenzen have already set sail for the Tavnazian Archipelago. You're following them, right?${prompt};
Sir, the airships are ready for departure.${prompt};
I will be traveling on a separate vessel. If “he” appears before I arrive, prevent him from escaping, but do not attack.${prompt};
Yes, sir!${prompt};
It is all working as planned. Now, I will finally retrieve what is mine.${prompt};
Hey there, pal.;
I just met the weirdest Elvaan kid.${prompt};
She didn't have a single gil on her, but she spent hours in the gem store mooning over the same piece of jewelry.${prompt};
Eventually, the beauties working behind the counter got tired of her antics and threw her out.${prompt};
I'd been watching the whole thing and had the rotten luck of meeting the girl's eyes when she left the store.${prompt};
She's been dogging me ever since.${prompt};
I don't know if it was female intuition or what, but somehow she figured out I have a thing for the three ladies in the gem store.${prompt};
...;
So, which one's my favorite out of the three?${prompt};
At first I thought the classical beauty on the left was my type.${prompt};
But then I got to thinking older women are the way to go, like the lady on the right.${prompt};
And then, not long ago, the pure and innocent type in the middle actually said hello to me.;
Now I'm captivated by her charms.${prompt};
To be perfectly honest with you, any of those three ladies could make me a happy man.${prompt};
My plan is to confess my feelings to the one who likes me the most--the one least likely to turn me down.${prompt};
When I explained all this to the Elvaan girl, she almost split her sides in laughter.;
The little brat!${prompt};
She told me that if I talked to each of the ladies in turn while holding ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I would know which of them had feelings for me.${prompt};
But I've never even heard of ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, let alone seen one.${prompt};
Even an adventurer like you wouldn't have a clue where to get a gem like that, would you?${prompt};
Any clue about ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
I have a pretty good idea.;
Never heard of them.${prompt};
No clue, right?;
I think that kid's just stringing me along for a laugh.${prompt};
You serious?;
Are you sure you're not just making fun of my feelings, like that Elvaan kid?${prompt};
Grrr!;
Just thinking about the smirk on that brat's face...${prompt};
Could I really find out which of those beauties had feelings for me if I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Nah, things are never that easy.;
That Elvaan brat is just making fun of me.${prompt};
Is that really...${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!?${prompt};
I can't believe that kid was telling the truth.;
Well, I'll be damned.${prompt};
There's no time to lose.;
I gotta get in there and find the girl of my dreams!${prompt};
You ready?;
I'm going in!${prompt};
I'm looking to buy a necklace...${prompt};
Of course, sir!;
Is it a gift for someone special?${prompt};
Um, yeah...could be...${prompt};
We have a great selection for you to choose from! Just a moment, sir!${prompt};
Man, my hands won't stop sweating.${prompt};
So how's this ${item-singular: 1[2]} supposed to work?${prompt};
Whoa!;
The ${item-singular: 1[2]} changed color!;
Is this what she meant!?${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 1[2]} is one fantastic gem!${prompt};
You wandered off before things got interesting, but you shoulda seen the sparks of romance fly between me and Adelflete.${prompt};
My mind is made up!${prompt};
It's more than just knowing that she likes me.;
Now I realize just how much I liked her!${prompt};
You say you've seen it all before?${prompt};
Hahaha!;
Looks like someone has a small case of jealousy.${prompt};
Well, here's a little present from the happiest man in the world to help cheer you up.${prompt};
Hahaha!;
Don't look so glum. The world's full of possibilities, even for you!${prompt};
Hahaha!;
I'm sorry, but one look at your face tells the whole story.;
Seeing me with my new girl reminds you of how unlucky you are, right?${prompt};
Don't worry, pal! The world's full of possibilities!;
Hahaha!${prompt};
The customer Adelflete just served--isn't he the man who's always loitering outside the store?${prompt};
Did you happen to see the gem he was holding?;
It's a rare stone that changes color depending on the temperature.${prompt};
Ah yes, I've seen one before.;
When the person holding it becomes hot and flustered, the hue of the gem changes.${prompt};
I've heard that it's used in other countries to measure the intensity of a person's feelings.${prompt};
Which would mean that he's quite taken by our Adelflete, wouldn't it?${prompt};
I was wondering who he was after for quite a while now.;
Now we know.${prompt};
I can't wait to see what happens.;
It's just like having one of those romantic plays right inside the store!${prompt};
What, you want to explore the towers of Pso'Xja?;
That shouldn't be a problem. We recently opened those ruins to all explorers.${prompt};
However, the Tenshodo is currently conducting an investigation on the deeper areas of the central tower, and we can't have pesky adventurers running around getting in our way.${prompt};
Though...if you were to scratch our backs, we wouldn't have any problems scratching yours.${prompt};
It just happens that the Tenshodo is searching for a certain jewel that is very popular in the Near Eastern countries.${prompt};
What kind of gem is it? Hmmm... Well, they're thin, hexagonally shaped, and come in rare colors like carmine and cyan. I heard that rich people like to decorate their turbans with them.${prompt};
They even say that sometimes a strange light shoots from their centers, though I've never seen it happen.${prompt};
Luckily for you, we've been finding a lot of those jewels in the other towers of Pso'Xja.${prompt};
Unfortunately, some strange device in that place seems to weaken even the strongest of our members. That's where you come in.${prompt};
Now, if you were to find one of those and bring it back to me, I'm pretty sure I could convince the boss to allow you access to the central tower.${prompt};
If you want to have access to the deeper parts of Pso'Xja, bring me a jewel from the ruins and I'll see what I can do.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
This looks a lot like what we're dealing in, but the color just isn't right. We want something a little more “exotic” than the regular colored gems.${prompt};
Well, what do you know?;
This is exactly what we've been looking for.${prompt};
You know, you're not a bad treasure hunter. Did you ever think of joining the Tenshodo?${prompt};
Ah, but you'd probably get bored really quick.;
Anyway, take this pass. It will give you access to the more “sensitive” areas of the ruins.${prompt};
But I'll warn you one last time--the central tower ruins are still under investigation.${prompt};
Don't expect any search parties if you happen to get lost.${prompt};
Welcome to Neptune's Spire!;
Hm? Oh, I remember you. You're the one that brought us that gem from Pso'Xja.;Bienvenue à Neptune's Spire !
After you brought it in, we learned that... Wait, how do I know I can trust you?${prompt};Hm ? Oh, je me souviens de vous. Vous êtes celui/celle qui nous a apporté ce joyau de Pso'Xja.
Can you keep a secret?;Après l'avoir apporté, nous avons appris que... Attendez, comment puis-je savoir si je peux vous faire confiance ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Pouvez-vous garder un secret ?
My lips are sealed.;
I can't guarantee anything.${prompt};Mes lèvres sont scellées.
Then the Tenshodo can't trust you with this info.;Je ne peux rien garantir.${prompt}
See you around, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady].${prompt};Alors, le Tenshodo ne peut pas vous faire confiance avec cette information.
Welcome to Neptune's...;Au revoir, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame].${prompt}
Ah, look who's back. Did you find some glue for your loose lips?${prompt};Bienvenue à Neptune's...
If I find out you told anyone about this, I'll... Well, you know what we'll do to you.;Ah, regardez qui est de retour. Avez-vous trouvé de la colle pour vos lèvres lâches ?${prompt}
Anyway, about those Pso'Xja gems...${prompt};Si je découvre que vous avez dit à quelqu'un cette information, je... Eh bien, vous savez ce que nous vous ferons.
Well, it looks like those jewels aren't just any rocks that fell out of some hole in a mountain.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, à propos de ces joyaux de Pso'Xja...${prompt}
Thanks to adventurers like you, we've learned that there are three types: gray, cyan, and carmine--and they all harbor some kind of strange energy that's not found anywhere else on Vana'diel.${prompt};Il semblerait que ces joyaux ne soient pas juste des roches tombées d'un trou dans une montagne.${prompt}
Also, we've recently received reports from our colleagues in Bastok that the chief Republican engineer, Cid, has been collecting the gems.${prompt};Grâce aux aventuriers comme vous, nous avons appris qu’il existe trois types : gris, cyan et carmin - et ils renferment tous une sorte d’énergie étrange qui n’est trouvée nulle part ailleurs sur Vana’diel.${prompt}
Now, if we can find out what power those chips truly hold, the Tenshodo could make a killing!${prompt};De plus, nous avons récemment reçu des rapports de nos collègues à Bastok indiquant que le chef ingénieur républicain, Cid, collectait les joyaux.${prompt}
Oh, and of course you'll get your cut. You're not thinking we'd short-change you, are you?${prompt};Maintenant, si nous pouvions découvrir quelle puissance ces éclats détiennent vraiment, le Tenshodo pourrait faire une fortune !${prompt}
The IRNC has dispatched me to help support all those who wish to participate in Conflict.${prompt};Oh, et bien sûr, vous aurez votre part. Vous ne pensez pas que nous allons vous court-circuiter, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.${prompt};
Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times:;
Match 1: ${earthtime: 0};
Match 2: ${earthtime: 1};
Match 3: ${earthtime: 2}${prompt};
Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of ${number: 0} gil is required before each match.${prompt};

Basic rules.;
Official/private matches.;
Flammen-Brenner.;
Flamme.;
Match score.;
Petras and quarrying.;
Sprint.;
KO.;
Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
You find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} hidden within the streetlamp and place it in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};
"You should be careful in a big city like Jeuno; there are always people ready to take advantage of your naiveté.${prompt}";
Even a city dweller like me was duped a while back by a young Elvaan girl.${prompt};
She tricked me into giving her my fishing rod...${prompt};
I wanna give this fishing lark a go.;
Lend me your fishing rod!${prompt};
Lend you my rod?;
Why would I do a thing like that?${prompt};
I don't know what country town you came from, but here in the city we don't just lend our possessions to total strangers.${prompt};
You're not gonna use it anymore, right?;
I can tell.${prompt};
What would you know!?${prompt};
I...I'm looking for the perfect place to cast my line.;
It takes time to find just the right spot.${prompt};
Uh-huh.;
But you've already found the perfect place.${prompt};
You just don't have the guts to go there.;
You're even trying to convince yourself it's not the best spot after all.${prompt};
How dare you...!?${prompt};
Just give me your damn rod.;
I'll go to Qufim Island and prove that you can catch ${item-plural: 1[2]} in that spot!${prompt};
Now that I think about it, she probably knew my fishing buddies were making fun of my idea that ${item-plural: 1[2]} could be caught on Qufim.${prompt};
Even when I said I'd caught the elusive ${item-singular: 2[2]} in East Sarutabaruta, my friends wouldn't believe me.${prompt};
If I'm that great a fisherman, I should be able to go to Qufim Island and catch the legendary ${item-singular: 1[2]}, they said.${prompt};
But fishing out on that island is sheer madness.;
You can get attacked by all sorts of horrible creatures.${prompt};
To me, fishing is a hobby, a leisurely pastime.;
It's not worth risking my life for.${prompt};
I bet that girl knew if she cooked up that story, I would lend her my rod.${prompt};
A little while later she came back, insisting she had used my rod to catch ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I never saw my fishing rod again, though.${prompt};
When I asked what happened, she said a monster she had fished up took it from her.${prompt};
Can you believe that!?;
She probably just sold my lovely rod and used the money to buy ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} at the auction house!${prompt};
Do you think he was duped?;
${selection-lines};
Absolutely.;
Of course not.${prompt};
Hm? You really think some creature from the depths made off with my fishing rod?${prompt};
Haven't you been listening to a thing I said about being naive?${prompt};
If you really believe her story, then you should prove it.${prompt};
If, as you say, the girl really lost the rod, then it must still be in the clutches of some monster in Qufim!${prompt};
She was lying, right?;
Please help me find my precious ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};
I'll make it worth your while, I assure you!${prompt};
That girl said a monster she had fished up on Qufim Island took my ${item-singular: 4[2]} from her.${prompt};
If you really believe her story, then you should prove it.${prompt};
She probably just sold my poor ${item-singular: 4[2]} to the highest bidder!${prompt};
Please help me find my precious rod.;
I'll make it worth your while, I assure you!${prompt};
This...this broken rod...${prompt};
The story about the monster was true.${prompt};
Why would such a tiny girl risk her life like that...${prompt};
I am sorry, adventurer.${prompt};
To be honest with you, I knew all along the girl wasn't telling tall tales.${prompt};
My fishing rod is famous among my friends, and couldn't be so easily sold without my knowledge.${prompt};
But I couldn't understand why...${prompt};
Why would she go and fish in that dangerous spot for the sake of a total stranger?${prompt};
It was this question that prevented me from trusting her word.${prompt};
Tell me, adventurer.;
You're friends with that girl.${prompt};
You must be.;
After all, you went and found this ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};
You risked your life to prove the girl wasn't lying...${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
...Now I get it.;
That's what this is about.${prompt};
I thought it was crazy to put myself in that kind of danger for the sake of my hobby.${prompt};
But it's not crazy to use that hobby to protect something important, as you did...${prompt};
That girl went to Qufim in my stead...${prompt};
She went there to retrieve the pride I had lost in my favorite pastime.${prompt};
Thank you, adventurer.;
You helped me to realize this.;
When you meet up with that girl next time, give her my thanks.${prompt};
And this is for all the trouble I've put you through.${prompt};
Thanks again, adventurer.${prompt};

Thanks for ya help.${prompt};
Huh? Ya wanna go with those guys into Movalpolos?${prompt};
There's a Galka down there that you're trying ta find?${prompt};
Ya wanna learn more about the Moblin city?${prompt};
Hrm.;
If the place is anything like it used ta be, I doubt the Moblins would let anyone live with them.${prompt};
Hrm.;
Can't say we Goblins know much about Movalpolos these days, either.${prompt};
When Movalpolos popped up a hundred years ago, the Moblins were still willin' ta talk with others.${prompt};
But after their contact with people, they had some sorta revelation. The Moblins started believin' they were the children of the Twilight God.${prompt};
That's why the Moblins never teamed up with the Shadow Lord in that big fracas twenty years ago.${prompt};
When the Moblin messengers delivered their refusal to join the Shadow Lord's army, they were torn ta pieces.${prompt};
The message went like this:;
Promathia is the true king of the beastmen. The Shadow Lord is an imposter, and holds no ties to the Twilight God.${prompt};
Ever since then, the Moblins have even been shunned by other beastmen.${prompt};
This all happened because of their fanatical devotion ta Promathia.;
There's no way a child of Altana would be tolerated in the Moblin city.${prompt};
This all happened because of their fanatical devotion ta Promathia.${prompt};
But I've seen a Galka down there!${prompt};
But they might attack Bastok at any time!${prompt};
Me too! Me too!${prompt};
At any time!${prompt};
Hmm...;
I guess there could be a Galka livin' with them who follows Promathia.${prompt};
Ya could be right. But somethin' is holding them back for now.${prompt};
Looks like if ya wanna talk ta that Galka, you're gonna hafta travel deep into Movalpolos.${prompt};
If you wanna find out what that is, ya should tag along with these two.${prompt};
The heart of Movalpolos is filled with extra-mean, really tough Moblins.${prompt};
If we take a person with us, they'll jump on us and break our bones and make us into soup.${prompt};
Probably.;
But if we don't help ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], ${choice-player-gender}[he'll/she'll] never even make it that far.${prompt};
Gotta think of a plan.${prompt};
Moblins are no good at words. No good at talking.${prompt};
Goblins and adventurers aren't so good either.${prompt};
But I know someone who is. I heard about him from Pauluart.${prompt};
A guy who's good at words. Good at talking.;
Pauluart called him a “tactician.”${prompt};
The tactician lives in Kazham. He wears all red and tells white lies.${prompt};
If you ask him, he should help you.;
I wrote a letter for you to take, but it's kinda rough.;
Muck, make it sound nice.${prompt};
Ya brought a letter from the tactician?${prompt};
Hmm.;
I guess that could work.;
I'll let Sniggnix work his magic on that pot ya brought with ya.${prompt};
Sniggnix, get this pot ready.${prompt};
Right, Muck.${prompt};
Stufstix and Pawnpix. You two go ahead to Movalpolos and check out the situation.${prompt};
Take the pot when Sniggnix is done with it, and catch up with them.${prompt};
The plan is for ya to tell the Moblins that you're a Gob who's disguised as a person.${prompt};
The Moblins've got no clue as ta what's goin' on up here, so they'll believe it when ya say Goblins have a spell to change their shape.${prompt};
The pot's full now.${prompt};
That pot is jammed with stuff that smells of Goblins.;
Don't take off the lid, whatever ya do.${prompt};
Off ya go, then.${prompt};
Take that letter to the tactician in Kazham.;
If what Sniggnix says is true, he should have some tricks up his sleeve for ya.${prompt};
All these people running back and forth... There have to be a few that have munched down more mithkabobs than they can manage.;
(And if I don't hand in this report to the Orastery soon... Ulp!)${prompt};
Hey you!;
Belly bursting? Intestines inflating? Bladder bulging? I can tell by the notch on your belt that you've been overindulging yourself in culinary delights.${prompt};
Well, you're in luck! I happen to be an expert magician versed well in the digestive arts. It's kind of in-between white and black magic...brown magic, you could call it. Anyway, you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, and I'll fix your indigestion on the spot!${prompt};
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I can't force you into doing anything you don't want to...${prompt};
I mean, this is a new era. If somebody wants to go around with their flabby-flubber hanging out of their cloaks, they should have every right to do so. If someone wants to walk around town with breath reeking of Kazham pines and roasted sleepshrooms, who am I to stop them?${prompt};
What? You want me to tend to your tummy trouble? No problem!;
And don't worry, this won't hurt at all! I'm only going to be flushing your bowels with thousands of tiny lightning bolts. It's all perfectly safe!${prompt};
Now stand still!;
You wouldn't want your pelvis to implode, would you?;
(Let's see... What were those magic words again...?)${prompt};
Ready?;
No?;
Well, too bad!${prompt};
Bulging...! (Was this it?);
Belly...! (No, that's not right...);
BURST!!! (Oh, who cares? Let the excremental exodus begin!);
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s stomach growls.;
I did it! I did it!;
Ahem! I mean... Of course I did it.${prompt};
Another case of cantankerous constipation cured! You're free to fill your face once again!;
But remember, if you ever binge a bit beyond your belly's boundaries, you know who to call!${prompt};
(Heh heh heh. Success number ${number: 1}! With this kind of data, I'm sure to win the Orastery's Scientist of the Year award!)${prompt};

${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s face goes pale...;
Uh-oh...;
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!${prompt};

This is terrible! The minister will have my head!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} quickly begins casting another spell!;
Phew! That was close...;
What were you thinking, crazy adventurer!?${prompt};
What would people say if you were to kick the bucket?;
They'd be pointing fingers, and those fingers would be pointing at me!;
Why should I be incongruously incarcerated for such an insane incident!?${prompt};
(That makes ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[failure/failures] to date. Oh well... All in the name of science, I guess.)${prompt};

To show you my gratitude, let me try out this new spell I thought up yesterday while I was taking a nap!;
Ta-da... Whoa!;
I've done it! I've finally invented a magic spell that has the same effect as Flee! Now I'm guaranteed to receive Scientist of the Year honors!${prompt};
I have to write this down!;
Hm...?;
Wait a minute... Where's my quill? I know I have it on me here somewhere... Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a spare quill on you, would you?${prompt};
Here it is!;
Now what was that first incantation...?;
Aaahhh... I can't remember!!!${prompt};
Oh well, I'm sure if I fail a few more spells I'll remember.${prompt};

Here it is. “The Lost Looking Glass.”;
I assume you wispy-wish to read about the Glass of Blessed Radiance?${prompt};
This tome describes the events leading up to when the Glass of Blessed Radiance lost its power.;
The author is quite the mirror enthusiastaru...${prompt};
Yes.;
The mirror's guardians stole the power of the Glass of Blessed Radiance as it rested in the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Hm hm hm...;
Do you not see? They were called the guardians of the mirror, but in truth were something quite different.${prompt};
They were the last line of defense against the Empire.;
That is why their existence was shrouded in secrecy...${prompt};
You think my theory unfounded?${prompt};
It matters not. One day I will uncover all the facts, and then I shall have the last laugh!;
Bwahahahahahaha!${prompt};
“The Mirror of Blighted Gloom is a divine artifact, designed to channel an otherworldly might...”${prompt};
Hmm...;
I suppose this means to describe the magnitude of the mirror's power.;
A childish phrase, but it does give some hint of the power's source...${prompt};
“An otherworldly might.”;
Meaning an energy that originates in another dimension...${prompt};
Hehehe.;
The person...or being...who crafted this mirror must have shared a brilliance akin to my own.${prompt};
And if our goals were as similar, then the origin of this power...${prompt};
Hehe...;
This is promising indeed.;
Hahaha...bwahahahahaha!${prompt};
Hehehehe...;
It is just as I suspected!${prompt};
The Mirror of Blighted Gloom is a conduit to the Dark Divinity!${prompt};
All my theories have been proven.;
This “otherworldly might” must be mine.${prompt};
It is time to put my research to the test!;
Bwahahahahaha!${prompt};
This tome--“The Lost Looking Glass”--is a collection of research notes written by Taliesin, and organized into a book by one of his friends.;
I had a devil-wevil of a time finding it.${prompt};
Taliesin fell victim to a deadly illness before he managed to finish his research.${prompt};
I bet he was really peevy-weeved to leave things undone like that.;
I'm something of a researcher myself, so I can imagine the frustration.${prompt};
Maybe the desire to continue his work has cursed him to wander the world as a ghost!;
I justaru love horror stories...${prompt};
Ahem. Anyway, there are many passages on the Glass of Blessed Radiance in here.;
It truly was a beautiful piece...${prompt};
During that incident in Jugner Forest, a blinding light poured out from the mirror to envelop everything in an incandescent glow.${prompt};
Could that light have been...?${prompt};
That light...?${prompt};
Justaru like the glow of the Glass of Blessed Radiance was described in Taliesin's notes!${prompt};
But how could this be?;
Its power is meantaru to be sealed within a lake of ice--a place in the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier known as “Mirror Pond.”${prompt};
There is a tale that says the seal is protected by the spirit of a mirror guardian.${prompt};
If you burn ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} on top of a slab of ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} by the shores of the lake, the spirit is supposed to become visible.${prompt};
To gather-wather these items, you need a few different tools: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
I wanted to try it myself as partaru of my research, but there were too many nasty-wasties roaming the area.${prompt};
Hmm...${prompt};
So. How about you find this pond of ice and have a chat with the resident spirit about the Glass of All-Seeing?${prompt};
The spirit of a guardian...?${prompt};
Spirit, you say...?${prompt};
A guardian spirit...${prompt};
The spirit of a mirror guardian...?${prompt};
Spirit? You mean...like a ghost?${prompt};
A spirit!?${prompt};
The spirit of a guardian...?${prompt};
S-s-spirit, you said...?${prompt};
The spirit of a guardian...?${prompt};
The ghost of a guardian...?${prompt};
The spirit of a mirror guardian...?${prompt};
A guardian spirit who protects the mirror...${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
If there's no other way...;
You're coming with me, right, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can discover, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Ah...okay...;
You're coming with me, right ${name-player}?${prompt};
Seems to be the only lead we have.;
Let's see what we can find out, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Okay, then.;
Let's get a move on, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Right.;
Let's see what we can discover, okay ${name-player}?${prompt};
Right.;
${name-player}, we will go this pond Luto speaks of.${prompt};
Oh, hello.;
You were here before, weren't you?${prompt};
Your friends are gone, I'm afraid.;
Something absolutely dreadful has happened...${prompt};
I heard a child crying in the middle of the night, and when I went to investigate...${prompt};
No...;
Daddy... Don't leave...${prompt};
Don't go away...${prompt};
It's alrrright, child.;
We're not going anywhere.${prompt};
I'll leave your father's mirror here.;
It'll help protect you from nightmares.${prompt};
You should try getting some rrrest as well.;
Let's go get something to eat, shall we?${prompt};
I don't want to leave her all alone...${prompt};
She'll be fine.;
Your neighbor will keep an eye on her.${prompt};
Daddy...${prompt};
...?;
Me...? You mean I get to keep the mirror...?${prompt};
This is the place...${prompt};
I think I'll have my prize come to me...${prompt};
Who...are...you...?${prompt};
Where...?${prompt};
Well done, child.;
Now, I shall relieve you of your burden...${prompt};
!?;
What have we here...?${prompt};
Daddy...;
I will...protect...the mirror...${prompt};
You seek to defy me?${prompt};
I have no time for this foolishness...${prompt};
That man...?${prompt};
Palometa...!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
These people have uncanny timing.${prompt};
You're coming with me, child...${prompt};
My hands are still shaking...${prompt};
After the girl was taken, the Mithran lady searched all over the place for her...${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We must speak with Luto!${prompt};
We have to speak with Luto!${prompt};
We must speak with Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We have to talk to Luto!${prompt};
We must speak with Luto!${prompt};
We must speak with Luto!${prompt};
I think she's going to be okay, but I took Palometa to the doctor just in case.;
Laurana is with her.${prompt};
She's probably fine, but I took Palometa to the doctor just in case.;
Laurana is there, too.${prompt};
Just in case, I took Palometa to the doctor.;
Laurana is there with her. I think she'll be okay.${prompt};
I think she'll be fine, but I took Palometa to the doctor just to be on the safe side.;
Laurana is with her.${prompt};
I think she'll be okay, but I took Palometa to the doctor anyway, just to be sure.;
Laurana is with her.${prompt};
I took Palometa to the infirmary, just to be on the safe side.;
Laurana is with her, too.${prompt};
I think she's going to be okay, but I took Palometa to the doctor just in case.;
Laurana is with her.${prompt};
She's probably fine, but I took Palometa to the doctor just in case.;
Laurana is there, too.${prompt};
Just in case, I took Palometa to the doctor.;
Laurana is there with her. I think she'll be okay.${prompt};
She seems fine, but I took Palometa to the doctor just in case.;
Don't worry, her mom is there with her.${prompt};
I think she'll be fine, but I took Palometa to the doctor just to be on the safe side.;
Laurana is with her.${prompt};
Palometa appears to be fine, but that is a risk I will not take.;
She is now resting at the infirmary, with Laurana beside her.${prompt};
Let's take a walk.${prompt};
Come for a walk?${prompt};
Let's head outside.${prompt};
Shall we head outside?${prompt};
Let's go for a walk.${prompt};
Let's get some fresh air.${prompt};
Let's go outside.${prompt};
Walk with me?${prompt};
Let's head outside.${prompt};
Let's go for a walk.${prompt};
Shall we head outside?${prompt};
Come with me.${prompt};
...And so, I never did find out where the Mirror of Blighted Gloom was hidden.;
I wish it were otherwise...${prompt};
You wouldn't be trying to keep the mirror for yourself, now would you?${prompt};
What a thing to suggest!;
You insult my professional prrride!${prompt};
Alright, alright.;
We'll consider our arrangement canceled for the moment...${prompt};
I'm sure I don't need to remind you, but our search for the Mirror of Blighted Gloom is to remain a private matter.${prompt};
If we find that you have been indiscrete...${prompt};
I get the picture.;
You can trrrust me.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
Does this story speak about the battle between the entities of light and dark?${prompt};
When opposites meet, there is sometimes a violent confrontation.${prompt};
This is something I've often encountered on my travels.${prompt};
But these events have been truly surprising...${prompt};
I always believed myself to be an experienced adventurer.${prompt};
I thought that few things could shake me.;
How naive that was...${prompt};
Since meeting you, I've come face to face with my own shortcomings.${prompt};
I never believed that having a partner on my travels would teach me so much about myself.${prompt};
And that's why I want to continue our adventures together.${prompt};
Our partnership has been the greatest treasure I've ever found...${prompt};
I hope we can keep exploring the wonders of this world side by side, and improve our skills as adventurers.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
I always thought that adventuring lacked a certain punch.${prompt};
I wanted to be in the middle of some huge event--to meet someone with as much zest as me!${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
When I heard this tale, I thought, “This is just what I'm looking for!”${prompt};
I guess what I'm trying to say is that following the guidance of my mirror and giving you the signal pearl was the right choice.${prompt};
To tell the truth, I doubted the powers of the mirror at first.${prompt};
But after listening to Palometa's story, I was glad that I trusted in the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt};
Looking back, these past events have been just the kind of excitement I needed.${prompt};
The mirror is a great treasure--that's for sure!${prompt};
But I value the friendship we've made even more!${prompt};
You hold on to that pearl, you hear me, ${name-player}!?${prompt};
I felt a strange power within the Glass of All-Seeing from the first moment I picked it up.${prompt};
Since meeting Palometa, that sensation continued to grow...${prompt};
Until finally I wasn't sure if it was the mirror giving off these waves, or something else entirely...${prompt};
I couldn't figure it out.${prompt};
I even felt this supernatural force when adventuring with you.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
This tale made everything clear to me.${prompt};
When the bearer of the Mirror of Blighted Gloom meets the wielder of the Glass of Blessed Radiance, something huge is supposed to happen.${prompt};
The power I felt was a premonition of the brewing storm.${prompt};
Looking back, that story was almost prophetic.${prompt};
But it was thanks to you that we came through this storm unharmed.${prompt};
You have my thanks.${prompt};
If anything like this ever happens again, I mean to stand and face it by your side.${prompt};
Don't ever forget that.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa recited?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
You can certainly feel the conviction of the people who composed this tale...${prompt};
Do you not think so?${prompt};
I wonder if the guiding power of the mirror was born from these people's thoughts.${prompt};
What could they possibly be trying to lead us to?${prompt};
In any event, the Glass of All-Seeing has taken me on an amazing journey.${prompt};
And having you accompany me has only enriched the experience.${prompt};
The glass lies dormant now...${prompt};
But even without its guidance...${prompt};
I hope to continue my adventures with you.${prompt};
I shall be ready to answer your call, ${name-player}.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story Palometa told us a while back?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
This talk of two great masses, and a violent storm...;
Sounds like a battle, don't you think?${prompt};
But then, what could the fragments be referring to?${prompt};
The fragments that were born of our recent battle...${prompt};
Could they be the bonds of friendship that grew between Luto, Palometa, and ourselves?${prompt};
(And the two shards...)${prompt};
(Perhaps they are you and me? Is this wishful thinking?)${prompt};
Whatever this all means, I'm glad to have met everyone.;
I will always treasure the friendship that has developed between all of us.${prompt};
One more thing, ${name-player}.;
This is embarrassing, but...${prompt};
I...I want to always be able to adventure with you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
And...I hope you feel the same way.${prompt};
I just wanted to let you know.;
I'm not going to say it again, so don't ever forget it, okay?${prompt};
Hey, ${name-player}. The story that Palometa told us some time ago, do you remember how it goes?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
When I heard this story for the first time, a tingle ran down my spine...${prompt};
I felt as though the Glass of All-Seeing had guided me all my life to arrive at that very moment.${prompt};
I just knew that a life-changing experience had been set in motion.${prompt};
Since arriving in Jeuno, I've met so many people and survived so many incidents, I'm starting to lose track.${prompt};
But there is one thing I'll never forget: the time we first met.${prompt};
You appeared before me at the Eldieme Necropolis, ${name-player}.${prompt};
This might sound a little exaggerated, but never before had I felt destiny so keenly.;
It was as though the mirror wanted me to meet you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I almost heard it whisper, “your future lies with this person.”${prompt};
Sounds incredible, doesn't it?;
But it's true.${prompt};
I've never enjoyed adventuring as much as when I'm with you, ${name-player}.;
I simply cannot recall how I managed to get by until we met.${prompt};
Promise me we'll be friends forever, ${name-player}.${prompt};
At first, I was only interested in the Glass of All-Seeing's beauty.${prompt};
But over time, the images it showed me became the focus of my journey.${prompt};
Following its guidance led me to you, Luto, and Palometa.${prompt};
I'm so glad Palometa was able to regain her father's mirror.${prompt};
And I'm also thrilled that the blessed radiance was restored to my looking glass.${prompt};
A feat I couldn't have accomplished without your help.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
I think we were swept up in the storm mentioned in that tale.${prompt};
And that awful man was at the center of it all.${prompt};
Can we assume that the mirrors are safe now that our opponent has been defeated?${prompt};
I certainly hope so.;
And I hope Palometa will know peace in her life from now on.${prompt};
She's seen so much strife for one so young...${prompt};
We've been traveling together for so long now that I don't think I can go back to being alone.${prompt};
But you'll keep adventuring alongside me, won't you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
I know you'll never let me down.${prompt};
Luto mentioned something about the rarity of the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt};
But who would've thought that it concealed the power to counter the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
Well, these events haven't exactly been a storm, but I wonder if these two powerful objects were ever responsible for starting any wars...${prompt};
When I think that this mirror may hold powers beyond my understanding...I get a little nervous about holding on to it.${prompt};
But of course, I'm not gonna give it up!;
There are too many amazing memories...${prompt};
Whatever this mirror shows in the future, I hope we can gaze into its mysteries together.${prompt};
Don't worry, I'll be keeping this wonderful treasure around!${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
People always grow to desire anything that transcends the ordinary.;
I was no different...${prompt};
But then I found the Glass of All-Seeing...${prompt};
And when I realized the power I held in my hands, I grew afraid.${prompt};
Ever since I began adventuring with you, however...${prompt};
...I've been able to forget about that fear.${prompt};
You've been a guiding force in my life.${prompt};
And it's thanks to you that I can bear this incredible treasure with a sense of wonder.${prompt};
I don't know how to express my gratitude...${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Know that I'll always be around to help in your adventures.${prompt};
I'll be ready and waiting for your call.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
The Glass of All-Seeing is the thing that brought us together.${prompt};
But if the true force guiding me was the connection between the two mirrors...${prompt};
...Then the end of my journey was Palometa.${prompt};
I couldn't believe it when we learned she was gonna be the guardian of her father's mirror.${prompt};
I felt a little sad as well.${prompt};
But even though you're not the person I was fated to meet, you're still an irreplaceable part of my life.${prompt};
So, listen up!${prompt};
I want us to keep on adventuring together.${prompt};
Our meeting may have been pure chance...${prompt};
But I'm glad you were there at the end of my path.${prompt};
And nothing is ever gonna change that!${prompt};
I have been thinking about the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa recited?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
Personally, I believe this tale to be an abstract description of how new things are born when people come together.${prompt};
And when that new thing has the power to reach the heavens, it will truly be treasured.${prompt};
The Glass of All-Seeing was responsible for bringing us together.${prompt};
Yet even if our meeting was not of our own design...${prompt};
...I value the time we have been given.${prompt};
I will never forget what we have accomplished.${prompt};
Our adventures are priceless to me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
And I hope that we continue to have them...${prompt};
${name-player}, do you still remember Palometa's story?${prompt};
Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt};
One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt};
One, an entity of “light.”${prompt};
Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt};
The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt};
One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.;
One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt};
And thus we pray.;
To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt};
I interpret this to be a story about the greatness of chance meetings.${prompt};
There are chance meetings the value of which is comparable to the rarest of treasures.;
I think you'll agree.${prompt};
It was through the Glass of All-Seeing's power, not mere chance, that we were able to meet, you and I.${prompt};
Without the mirror's guidance, I daresay our paths may never have crossed.${prompt};
However, this in no way detracts from the importance I place in our friendship.${prompt};
I am grateful the mirror led us together, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I thought you should know that.${prompt};
I look forward to your company for many more adventures to come...${prompt};
You feel the bonds between you and your adventuring fellow strengthen!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
Airships are prohibited from flying in the skies above the Aht Urhgan Empire.;
If you want to visit the Near East, by sea is the only way to go!${prompt};
Port Al Zahbi must be packed with all the people coming and going by ship, like Jeuno and Tavnazia used to be!${prompt};
Well, let me take a look at this Near Eastern cookbook I just got.;
It says “soup” is called “corbasi,” and the secret to a delicious dish is...${prompt};
Why, the secret is to simmer it in a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, of course!${prompt};
Jeuno is different from the other nations.;
I actually kind of enjoy watching everyone squabble with each other.${prompt};
I can't imagine why anyone would want to go all the way to the Near East and become a mercenary.${prompt};
I heard that the Near East is bursting at the seams with wonderful treasures never seen this side of Vana'diel.${prompt};
I can't figure out which sounds more interesting--the Tenshodo or the Near East...${prompt};
You have shiny badge.${prompt};
I don't have shiny badge.;
Very, very sad.${prompt};
Verena sensed that Lion was alive somewhere.${prompt};
I really wanted to believe her, but deep down I was convinced that we'd never see Lion again.${prompt};
You're one of a kind...${prompt};
Adventurers are more than simple sellswords looking to fight the next new monster in the next new land to bring home the newest treasure.${prompt};
You fulfill the dreams that others have given up on.;
That's what makes a true adventurer.${prompt};
Fighting with the ancients.;
Battling the Emptiness.${prompt};
For someone who stands at the peak of their adventuring career, I may be bringing up old news.${prompt};
But we will never forget. And there are others, too, who had given up on their dreams--they will remember you.${prompt};
So you should go to Norg. Go and see Lion.${prompt};
So you should go.${prompt};
There's someone waiting for you, am I right?${prompt};
You don't talk much, and I won't ask you about what happened beneath the light of that great, burning crystal.${prompt};
I'm just happy to have Lion back among us.;
If you head to Norg, you might even be able to see her.${prompt};
I'm just happy to have Lion back among us.${prompt};
The boss sure is cheerful these days.;
He was putting on a show before so we wouldn't worry, but I've known him too long to fall for that.${prompt};
He won't say anything about what happened. But that spark is back in his eye, and that's enough for me! Things are about to get interesting!${prompt};
Are you telling me that Lion's back?;
Where the hell has she been? She's lucky I don't give her what for.${prompt};
Lion...;
She really had us worried!${prompt};
What's going on?;
The boss is walking around like he's seen the Gates of Paradise, or something.${prompt};
He always gets like that when you're around.;
I don't get it, you don't look that special to me.;Il est toujours comme ça quand tu es là.
It's starting to give me the heebie-jeebies...${prompt};Je ne comprends pas, tu n'as pas l'air si spécial pour moi.
Being part of the Tenshodo means you'll sell your soul for the right amount of gil.${prompt};Ça commence à me donner la chair de poule...${prompt}
Besides, taking risks is good for business, I always say.${prompt};Faire partie des Tenshodo signifie que tu vendrais ton âme pour la bonne somme de gil.${prompt}
This time, we 'ave got quite a special customer, so we can't go prattling off about the details of their request to just anyone.${prompt};De plus, prendre des risques est bon pour les affaires, je dis toujours.${prompt}
Getting wind of such a thing could make our client a mite angry, and we certainly wouldn't want that.${prompt};Cette fois, nous avons un client très spécial, alors nous ne pouvons pas révéler les détails de sa demande à n'importe qui.${prompt}
That's why I 'ave been mixing up the orders with random bits o' information and givin' out mere snippets at a time. Those o' you with sense should be able to put it all together, is what I think.${prompt};Si cela venait à se savoir, notre client pourrait se mettre en colère, et nous ne voudrions certainement pas cela.${prompt}
I dare say I think you may fit into tha' category, as well.${prompt};C'est pourquoi j'ai mélangé les commandes avec des informations aléatoires et donné de simples bribes à la fois. Ceux qui ont du sens devraient pouvoir tout assembler, à mon avis.${prompt}
Anyway, that's how things are standing at the moment.;Je dirais que tu pourrais aussi appartenir à cette catégorie.${prompt}
Well, what need you? Speak up now.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, c'est ainsi que les choses se présentent pour le moment.
Ask about what?;Eh bien, que veux-tu ? Parle maintenant.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Demander à propos de quoi ?
Goods for sale.;
Nothing.;Marchandises à vendre.
${prompt};Rien.
Looks like I was wrong about you.;
Anyway, if you want to buy goods, hop on over to Ghebi Damomohe at the entrance or jus' talk to the two at the counter.${prompt};On dirait que je me suis trompé à ton sujet.
That's all I have t' say to you. Now get out o' here and let me do my business in peace.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, si tu veux acheter des marchandises, va voir Ghebi Damomohe à l'entrée ou parle juste aux deux au comptoir.${prompt}
If you do not need anything, wha' in blazes are you doing hangin' about here in the first place?${prompt};C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire. Maintenant, sors d'ici et laisse-moi faire mes affaires en paix.${prompt}
Why, I must say you're even brighter than you look.;Si tu n'as besoin de rien, que fais-tu donc ici à traîner dans les parages ?${prompt}
You got 'ere the same way, didn't you?${prompt};Eh bien, je dois dire que tu es encore plus intelligent que tu n'en as l'air.
Lately, people 'ave been strewing about ${item-plural: 0[2]} like there's no tomorrow, so a lot o' Tenshodo members don't know that trick.${prompt};Tu es arrivé ici de la même manière, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
O' course, me and the boss are on a whole different plane o' thinking.${prompt};Dernièrement, les gens ont éparpillé des ${item-plural: 0[2]} comme s’il n’y avait pas de lendemain, donc beaucoup de membres du Tenshodo ne connaissent pas ce tour.${prompt}
Still, the notion of “seeing the unseen” was one o' the main draws of the Tenshodo for me in the beginning. I've got high hopes for you...${prompt};Bien sûr, moi et le patron sommes sur un tout autre plan de réflexion.${prompt}
Eh?${prompt};Pourtant, la notion de « voir l'invisible » était l'une des principales attractions du Tenshodo pour moi au début. J'ai de grands espoirs pour toi...${prompt}
Ah, sorry. I left out the most important part, didn't I? Sorry t' leave you hanging there.${prompt};Hein ?${prompt}
Um... What was I saying, again?;Ah, désolé. J'ai laissé de côté la partie la plus importante, n’est-ce pas ? Désolé de te laisser en suspens.${prompt}
Oh, yeah...the Empire of Aht Urhgan. You want t' see the Near East, don't you? I can see it in your eyes.${prompt};Euh... Qu'est-ce que je disais, déjà ?
How does Aht Urhgan sound to you?;Oh, oui... l'Empire d'Aht Urhgan. Tu veux voir le Proche-Orient, n'est-ce pas ? Je le vois dans tes yeux.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu d'Aht Urhgan ?
I want to go!;
Psh, not interested.;Je veux y aller !
${prompt};Bof, pas intéressé.
Heheh, I appreciate your honesty.${prompt};
Is 'at so? That's all I 'ave to say to you then, so get out o' here.${prompt};Heheh, j'apprécie ton honnêteté.${prompt}
Well, aren't you clever? But once is enough. Seriously.${prompt};Est-ce que c'est ça ? C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire alors, sors d'ici.${prompt}
Anyway, that's enough batting aroun' the bush for now. Let's dig straight in t' the juicy details, shall we?${prompt};Eh bien, n'es-tu pas intelligent ? Mais une fois, c'est suffisant. Sérieusement.${prompt}
You know the ships at Mhaura used t' transport prospective mercenaries to the Near East? If you want t' climb aboard one o' those vessels, you 'ave got to go through none other than the Tenshodo here.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, assez tourné autour du pot pour l'instant. Passons directement aux détails croustillants, d'accord ?${prompt}
We received a request from the Empire 'erself. Getting those ships t' port was a royal pain. We finally managed t' bargain a cheap price on some rickety old vessels, and...${prompt};Tu sais que les navires à Mhaura transportaient autrefois des mercenaires potentiels vers le Proche-Orient ? Si tu veux monter à bord de l'un de ces navires, tu dois passer par le Tenshodo ici.${prompt}
And you don't care. Sorry abou' that. A man's got to vent sometimes.${prompt};Nous avons reçu une demande de l'Empire elle-même. Faire accoster ces navires était un véritable casse-tête. Nous avons finalement réussi à négocier un prix avantageux sur quelques vieux navires délabrés, et...${prompt}
Anyway, you should know by now how things work around 'ere. If you want something, you 'ave to bring me something I want, first.${prompt};Et tu t'en fiches. Désolé pour ça. Un homme doit parfois se défouler.${prompt}
If you aren't in the mood t' scavenge up what I want, you can always cough up gil instead. O' course, that would be quickest.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, tu devrais savoir maintenant comment les choses fonctionnent ici. Si tu veux quelque chose, tu dois d'abord m'apporter quelque chose que je veux.${prompt}
Let's make this explanation brief, shall we?${prompt};Si tu n'as pas envie de chercher ce que je veux, tu peux toujours donner des gils à la place. Bien sûr, ce serait plus rapide.${prompt}
You see, prices are a mite different in the Near East. Something that sells for a gil a dozen here might be a luxury item in Aht Urhgan.${prompt};Rendons cette explication brève, d'accord ?${prompt}
Jumping straigh' to the point, now.;Tu vois, les prix sont un peu différents au Proche-Orient. Quelque chose qui se vend une gil la douzaine ici pourrait être un article de luxe à Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
I want you t' bring me some common items from this side o' Vana'diel, and I'll give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt};Passons directement au but, maintenant.
The more you bring me, the better. I 'ave put together a few lists if you'd like to take a look. I will leave it t' you which to bring me.${prompt};Je veux que tu m'apportes des articles courants de ce côté de Vana'diel, et je te donnerai ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} en échange.${prompt}
Ah yes, and there is gil, too. Righto.;Plus tu m'apportes, mieux c'est. J'ai préparé quelques listes si tu veux y jeter un œil. Je te laisse choisir quoi m'apporter.${prompt}
You can buy your way out if you choose.${prompt};Ah oui, et il y a aussi les gils, bien sûr.
If you decide t' go the gil route, I will need ${number: 0} gil up front. That's nothing for adventurers nowadays, righ'? You can also consider it your price o' failure, heheh.${prompt};Tu peux acheter ton passage si tu choisis cette option.${prompt}
So what'll it be?;Si tu choisis la route des gils, j’aurai besoin de ${number: 0} gils à l’avance. Ce n’est rien pour les aventuriers de nos jours, n’est-ce pas ? Tu peux aussi considérer cela comme le prix de ton échec, heheh.${prompt}
I'll read the list now, so decide which set is in your budget and make a note o' what you need.${prompt};Alors, qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
What'll it be?;Je vais lire la liste maintenant, décide quel ensemble est dans ton budget et prends note de ce dont tu as besoin.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
Beginner list.;
Intermediate list.;Liste débutant.
Advanced list.;Liste intermédiaire.
Pay the ${number: 0} gil.;Liste avancée.
Please explain again.;Payer les ${number: 0} gils.
Let me think about it.${prompt};Veuillez expliquer à nouveau.
It's going t' take you some work if you want to go to Aht Urhgan, but you cannot get there through anyone but us.${prompt};Laisse-moi réfléchir.${prompt}
Heh heh heh...${prompt};Ça va te demander du travail si tu veux aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu ne peux pas y aller autrement que par nous.${prompt}
The advanced list, eh? A superb choice. The items on this list are few, so they should fit nicely in your bag, but they are quite difficult t' come by.;
You can choose from the following:${prompt};La liste avancée, hein ? Un choix superbe. Les articles sur cette liste sont peu nombreux, donc ils devraient bien tenir dans ton sac, mais ils sont assez difficiles à trouver.
One coffer key from a beastman stronghold--Davoi, Beadeaux, Castle Oztroja, the Temple of Uggalepih, the Den of Rancor, the Quicksand Caves, or the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt};Tu peux choisir parmi les suivants:${prompt}
A “testimony.” Those ancient scraps of papyrus seem t' be quite popular with collectors these days. I don't know all the details, but apparently there's a testimony for any o' the jobs an adventurer can be. Anyway, I just need one.${prompt};Une clé de coffre provenant d'un bastion des hommes-bêtes--Davoi, Beadeaux, Château Oztroja, le Temple d'Uggalepih, la Tanière du Rancor, les Cavernes de Sable, ou la Grotte du Serpent de Mer.${prompt}
Your last option is t' bring me chips from Pso'Xja.${prompt};Un “témoignage”. Ces vieux morceaux de papyrus semblent être très populaires auprès des collectionneurs ces jours-ci. Je ne connais pas tous les détails, mais apparemment, il existe un témoignage pour chacun des métiers d'un aventurier. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai juste besoin d'un seul.${prompt}
I'll need a set o' those, though. You'll 'ave to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, all three.${prompt};Ta dernière option est de m'apporter des fragments de Pso'Xja.${prompt}
That's it for the advanced list.;J’aurai besoin d’un ensemble de ceux-ci, cependant. Tu devras m’apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, les trois.${prompt}
You can bring me any one o' the above requests, but if you decide t' bring Pso'Xja chips, I'll need 'em in a set o' three.${prompt};C'est tout pour la liste avancée.
Intermediate, eh?;Tu peux m'apporter l'une des requêtes ci-dessus, mais si tu décides d'apporter des fragments de Pso'Xja, il me les faudra en lot de trois.${prompt}
This one is quite a bother.${prompt};Intermédiaire, hein ?
Beastmen 'ave been a real plague t' the Near East as of late. Not that we haven't been having problems here, too.${prompt};Celle-ci est assez ennuyeuse.${prompt}
But anyway, the situation 'as driven up the demand for beastman spoils.${prompt};Les hommes-bêtes ont été un vrai fléau pour le Proche-Orient ces derniers temps. Non pas que nous n'ayons pas eu de problèmes ici aussi.${prompt}
I want you t' bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};Mais quoi qu'il en soit, la situation a fait monter la demande pour les dépouilles des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
The beastmen have been using those t' relay orders. I require all three.${prompt};Je veux que tu m’apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}
That's all for the intermediate list.;Les hommes-bêtes les utilisent pour relayer des ordres. J’ai besoin des trois.${prompt}
It may sound simple, but those items are scattered all about the strongholds and are rather difficult t' get a hold of.${prompt};C'est tout pour la liste intermédiaire.
You say you want t' go to Aht Urhgan, but you're too big o' a coward to face a challenge, eh? That attitude will get you nowhere in the Empire, I tell you. Ah well, it's all the same t' me, as long as I make a profit.${prompt};Cela peut sembler simple, mais ces objets sont dispersés dans tous les bastions et sont assez difficiles à obtenir.${prompt}
This will be more like running errands, but there are a lot o' things for you to collect on this list.${prompt};Tu dis vouloir aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu es trop lâche pour affronter un défi, hein ? Cette attitude ne te mènera nulle part dans l'Empire, je te le dis. Ah bien, c'est tout pareil pour moi, tant que je fais du profit.${prompt}
There are a lot o' curious items here. I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};Ce sera plus comme des courses, mais il y a beaucoup de choses à collecter sur cette liste.${prompt}
Wait, there's more. I also require ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.;Il y a beaucoup d’objets curieux ici. Je veux que tu m’apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}
...Oh, and one last thing--${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. Hand me these six items at one time, and I will be satisfied.${prompt};Attends, il y a plus. J'ai aussi besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} et de ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.
Hoho!;...Oh, et une dernière chose--${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. Apporte-moi ces six objets en une fois, et je serai satisfait.${prompt}
So this high and mighty adventurer refuses t' be reduced to running errands!${prompt};Hoho !
Ah, sorry abou' that.${wait-36: 1};Alors ce grand et noble aventurier refuse d'être réduit à faire des courses !${prompt}
I'm not picking on you, so don't get your feathers in a ruffle.${prompt};Ah, désolé pour ça.${wait-36: 1}
So you are going t' pay me ${number: 0} gil. Is that correct?${prompt};Je ne te taquine pas, alors ne te mets pas en colère.${prompt}
You won't receive the permit immediately, you know. Are you okay with that?${prompt};Donc tu vas me payer ${number: 0} gils. C’est correct ?${prompt}
Pay ${number: 0} gil for the permit?;Tu ne recevras pas le permis immédiatement, tu sais. Est-ce que ça te va ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Payer ${number: 0} gils pour le permis ?
On second thought, no.;
Yes.${prompt};En y réfléchissant, non.
You're not going t' regret this later, are you?${prompt};Oui.${prompt}
Be honest.;Tu ne vas pas le regretter plus tard, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Sois honnête.
Now that you mention it...;
Regret? I know the word not!${prompt};Maintenant que tu le mentionnes...
Blimey! You've only got ${number: 6} gil?${wait-36: 2};Regretter ? Je ne connais pas ce mot !${prompt}
Come back when your pockets are a little heavier!${prompt};Sapristi ! Tu n'as que ${number: 6} gils ?${wait-36: 2}
Congratulations, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], we have a deal!;Reviens quand tes poches seront un peu plus lourdes !${prompt}
Come back tomorrow and I will give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Félicitations, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], nous avons un accord !

Good day t' you.;Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You can 'ave your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now!${prompt};Bonne journée à toi.
With this, you can ride t' the Near East from the port at Mhaura.${prompt};Tu peux avoir ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} maintenant !${prompt}
I 'ave got t' tell you up front, though, that the high seas are a dangerous place. I can't guarantee your safety, so travel at your own risk.${prompt};Avec ça, tu peux voyager vers le Proche-Orient depuis le port de Mhaura.${prompt}
If I were you, I'd be praying for the ship t' simply stay afloat.${prompt};Je dois vous prévenir dès le départ que les hautes mers sont un endroit dangereux. Je ne peux pas garantir votre sécurité, alors voyagez à vos risques et périls.${prompt}
Heh heh heh...${prompt};Si j'étais à votre place, je prierais pour que le navire reste simplement à flot.${prompt}

Righto. Here goes nothing.${prompt};J'ai votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ici. Malheureusement, je ne peux pas vous le remettre pour le moment.${prompt}
Being o' the Tenshodo, I couldn't accept such an exorbitant price for a simple permit without including some type o' extra service.${prompt};Allons-y.${prompt}
Can you hear me, anyway...?;Étant donné que je fais partie du Tenshodo, je ne pourrais accepter un prix aussi exorbitant pour un simple permis sans inclure un type de service supplémentaire.${prompt}
Well, when you open your eyes, you're in for a surprise. Heheh.${prompt};Est-ce que vous m'entendez, quand même...?
Ah, it's you again.;Eh bien, quand vous ouvrirez les yeux, vous serez surpris. Heheh.${prompt}
Did you make it t' Aht Urhgan in one piece? Sorry for catching you by surprise earlier.${prompt};Ah, c'est encore vous.
I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Aht Urhgan has a pact forbidding airships from flying over their nation.${prompt};Êtes-vous arrivé à Aht Urhgan en un seul morceau ? Désolé de vous avoir pris par surprise plus tôt.${prompt}
O' course, we found a way around that, and dropped you into that ginormous forest from the sky. The Tenshodo'll always give you your money's worth.${prompt};Je ne suis pas sûr que vous le sachiez ou non, mais Aht Urhgan a un pacte interdisant aux aéronefs de survoler leur nation.${prompt}
We didn't want anyone else t' know about that route, so we had t' bail you out from midair and keep the operation secret. Sorry, but it was the only way.${prompt};Bien sûr, nous avons trouvé un moyen de contourner cela, et nous vous avons largué dans cette immense forêt depuis le ciel. Le Tenshodo vous donnera toujours votre argent en valeur.${prompt}
${wait-animation: 1};Nous ne voulions pas que quelqu'un d'autre connaisse cette route, alors nous avons dû vous secourir en plein vol et maintenir l'opération secrète. Désolé, mais c'était le seul moyen.${prompt}

Read which chapter?;
${selection-lines};
1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”;
2. “Rules of the Roll.”;
3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt};
Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt};
Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt};
In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt};
If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt};
Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt};
Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt};
If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt};
Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt};
Bring 'em to me and I'll make your bag bigger.${prompt};
Don't know where on Vana'diel you're going to find most of those goodies, but I'm bettin' a Greedalox the likes of yourself'll find a way.${prompt};
Oh, and in case ya start gettin' the strange idea that after six or seven fixes you and me are buddies...stuff it! I still ain't gonna tell ya how I make your bag bigger. Ancient Gobbie secret!${prompt};
I hear that, unlike other cities, Jeuno has sought the path of peace since the advent of the Great War.${prompt};
It was Archduke Kam'lanaut, among other Jeunoan dignitaries, who championed the idea of an alliance of nations.${prompt};
The alliance forged in Jeuno's own Ru'Lude Gardens bound the separate armies into a force to be reckoned with.${prompt};

Well, okay. I can give ya ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[marble/marbles], no more. Do we got a deal?${prompt};
We got a deal?;
${selection-lines};
Deal.;
No deal.${prompt};
Hey, wait just a Mobbie minute there!;
Ya've already got Moblin Marbles comin' out of yer ears!;
Come back when ya can actually carry more, okay?${prompt};
You now have ${number: 0} Moblin ${choice-plurality: 0}[Marble/Marbles]!${prompt};
Your ${choice: 0}[Maze Rune was/Maze Runes were] returned to you.${prompt};
You obtained ${number: 0} Moblin ${choice-plurality: 0}[Marble/Marbles]!;
I say, do you see that!?${prompt};
It looks like...but could it truly be?;Je dis, tu vois ça !?${prompt}
A giant...crystal?${prompt};On dirait...mais pourrait-ce vraiment être ?
This light...it's like n-nothing I've ever seen!${prompt};Un énorme...cristal ?${prompt}
Aldo... Whatever could this mean?${prompt};Cette lumière...c'est comme rien de ce que j'ai jamais vu !${prompt}
I haven't a clue, Verena.;Aldo... Qu'est-ce que cela pourrait bien signifier ?${prompt}
...But I'd wager it doesn't bode well for us.${prompt};Je n'en ai aucune idée, Verena.
What is that thing!?;...Mais je parierais que cela ne présage rien de bon pour nous.${prompt}
And why do I have a feeling that it doesn't bode well for us...?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette chose !?
What could this mean, brother?;Et pourquoi ai-je l'impression que cela ne présage rien de bon pour nous...?${prompt}
Is it some sort of omen...?${prompt};Que pourrait signifier cela, frère ?
I only wish I had answers for you, Claidie...${prompt};Est-ce une sorte de présage...?${prompt}
One thing is for certain, though...we've not seen the likes of this crystal before.${prompt};J'aimerais seulement avoir des réponses pour toi, Claidie...${prompt}
That otherworldly light...;Une chose est certaine, cependant...nous n'avons jamais vu un cristal de ce genre auparavant.${prompt}
Could it be a visitant from Paradise...?${prompt};Cette lumière d'un autre monde...
It all began with a stone...;Pourrait-elle être une visiteuse du Paradis...?${prompt}
...or so the legend says...;Tout a commencé par une pierre...
Shh! Listen...!;...du moins, c'est ce que dit la légende...
Do you hear something?${prompt};Chut ! Écoute...!
Do my ears deceive me?;Entends-tu quelque chose ?${prompt}
This ethereal voice...${prompt};Mes oreilles me trompent-elles ?
It's coming from the crystal...;Cette voix éthérée...${prompt}
The crystal is...singing?${prompt};Elle vient du cristal...
The beckoning call of a preternatural stone...${prompt};Le cristal...chante ?${prompt}
I'll be damned if I know where that slab of rock came from, or what it's doing here.;L'appel envoûtant d'une pierre surnaturelle...${prompt}
But one thing's for sure--that's no ordinary energy it's giving off!${prompt};Je serais bien en peine de dire d'où vient ce morceau de roche, ou ce qu'il fait ici.
No, I don't like the looks of this one bit.${prompt};Mais une chose est sûre : ce n'est pas une énergie ordinaire qu'il dégage !${prompt}
In ages past...;Non, je n'aime pas du tout l'apparence de cette situation.${prompt}
...a sentient jewel, enormous and beautiful...;Il y a des âges de cela...
...banished the darkness.;...un joyau sentient, immense et magnifique...
Its many-colored light filled the world with life and brought forth mighty gods.;...bannit les ténèbres.
I sense...such immense power.;Sa lumière multicolore remplit le monde de vie et fit surgir des dieux puissants.
This crystal harbors an unbelievably strong will...${prompt};Je sens...une puissance immense.
It would seem that we've got ourselves another trrroublesome situation on our hands...${prompt};Ce cristal renferme une volonté incroyablement forte...${prompt}
And so we face a most curious plight.;Il semblerait que nous ayons une autre situation prrroblématique sur les bras...${prompt}
What a perfect occasion for me to brandish my intellectual might!;Et ainsi nous faisons face à une situation des plus curieuses.
O～hohoho!${prompt};Quelle occasion parfaite pour moi de brandir ma puissance intellectuelle !
Stand back!;O～hohoho !${prompt}
You must not draw near!${prompt};Reculez !
That...thing. You must not approach it.;Vous ne devez pas vous approcher !${prompt}
It is...not meant to exist in this world.${prompt};Cette...chose. Vous ne devez pas vous en approcher.
Star Sibyl!;Elle...n'est pas censée exister dans ce monde.${prompt}
Not meant to exist in our worrrld?;Grande Prêtresse !
But that means--${prompt};Pas censée exister dans notre monde ?
That stone...;Mais cela signifie--${prompt}
It is...;Cette pierre...
It is--${prompt};Elle est...
No!!! The horror! The pain!;Elle est--${prompt}
Love! Love will be the ruin of us all!;Non !!! L'horreur ! La douleur !
Star Sibyl!?;L'amour ! L'amour sera notre perte à tous !
Are you outaru of your gourd, Professor!?${prompt};Grande Prêtresse !?
Surely you don't intend to tamperrr with that thing?${prompt};Êtes-vous totalement hors de vous, Professeur !?${prompt}
As if we didn't have enough trrrouble on our hands with the Star Sibyl's untimely abduction!${prompt};Vous n'avez tout de même pas l'intention de trifouiller cette chose ?${prompt}
Do I make myself clear, Professor?;Comme si nous n'avions pas déjà assez de prrroblèmes avec l'enlèvement intempestif de la Grande Prêtresse !${prompt}
You are not, under any circumstances, to create any further disturbances!${prompt};Est-ce bien clair, Professeur ?
But my dear Apururu, by the Goddess above.;Vous ne devez en aucun cas créer d'autres perturbations !${prompt}
We must act swiftly, lest our world be undone by the fury of love!${prompt};Mais ma chère Apururu, par la Déesse au-dessus de nous.
I'll hear nothing of it!;Nous devons agir rapidement, de peur que notre monde ne soit détruit par la fureur de l'amour !${prompt}
It's absolutely outaru of the question!${prompt};Je n'en veux rien entendre !
Vana'diel come to rrruin?${prompt};C'est absolument hors de question !${prompt}
By...love?;Vana'diel réduit à rrruin ?
Bathed in that light, the world entered an age of bliss...${wait-animation: 4};Par...l'amour ?
...until, after a time, the gods fell into slumber.${wait-animation: 6};Baigné dans cette lumière, le monde entra dans un âge de félicité...${wait-animation: 4}
That world was called Vana'diel.${wait-animation: 7};...jusqu'à ce qu'après un certain temps, les dieux tombent dans le sommeil.${wait-animation: 6}
Our world, Vana'diel...${wait-animation: 8};Ce monde s'appelait Vana'diel.${wait-animation: 7}
A Crystalline Prophecy ～Ode of Life Bestowing～${wait-animation: 12};Notre monde, Vana'diel...${wait-animation: 8}
What the--?;A Crystalline Prophecy ～Ode de la Vie～${wait-animation: 12}
What am I doing here?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que--?
Why, I could've sworn I just saw a--;Que fais-je ici ?${prompt}
Must just be my ol' noggin playin' tricks on me again...${prompt};Pourquoi, j'aurais juré avoir vu un--
Good heavens! This is no time for daydreaming!;Ça doit être mon vieux cerveau qui me joue des tours encore une fois...${prompt}
I must get back to work before the master scolds me!${prompt};Bon sang ! Ce n'est pas le moment de rêvasser !
Aldo...?;Je dois retourner au travail avant que le maître ne me gronde !${prompt}
Was that--${prompt};
No...it wasn't a dream, Verena.;Était-ce--${prompt}
I saw it too, plain as day.${prompt};Non...ce n'était pas un rêve, Verena.
A massive crystal floating majestically, and yet somehow ominously, like a star in the sky...${prompt};Je l'ai vu aussi, clair comme le jour.${prompt}
And yet, look at these people's faces.;Un cristal massif flottant majestueusement, et pourtant d'une manière inquiétante, comme une étoile dans le ciel...${prompt}
Blissful and unaware, as if they have no recollection of what they saw mere moments ago.${prompt};Et pourtant, regardez les visages de ces gens.
Not even a fleeting memory of that enormous jewel...${prompt};Heureux et inconscients, comme s'ils n'avaient aucun souvenir de ce qu'ils ont vu il y a quelques instants.${prompt}
...and its many-colored lights.;Pas même un souvenir fugace de ce joyau énorme...${prompt}
My eyes don't lie, and that was no idle hallucination just now.;...et de ses lumières multicolores.
A massive crystal...floating majestically, yet ominously, like a star in the sky....${prompt};Mes yeux ne mentent pas, et ce n'était pas une simple hallucination tout à l'heure.
Did you see them, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]? The many-colored beams of light...${prompt};Un cristal massif...flottant majestueusement, mais d'une manière inquiétante, comme une étoile dans le ciel....${prompt}
Did you hear the ancient song?${prompt};Avez-vous vu les faisceaux de lumière multicolores, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame] ?${prompt}
That was the memory of the crystal, the “Memoria de la S^tona.”;Avez-vous entendu la chanson ancienne ?${prompt}
The song of ages past that heralded the birth of the gods...${prompt};C'était la mémoire du cristal, le “Memoria de la S^tona.”
And yet, look at the townsfolk around you.;La chanson des temps anciens qui annonçait la naissance des dieux...${prompt}
How strange... It's as if they never noticed a thing.${prompt};Et pourtant, regardez les habitants autour de vous.
Or perhaps they did, but don't recall...?${prompt};Comme c'est étrange... C'est comme s'ils n'avaient rien remarqué.${prompt}
No memory of what they heard and saw.;Ou peut-être l'ont-ils fait, mais ne s'en souviennent-ils pas...?${prompt}
How curious indeed.${prompt};Aucun souvenir de ce qu'ils ont entendu et vu.
Doesn't this make you wonder, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]?;Comme c'est curieux.
Aren't you troubled by what you're seeing?${prompt};Cela ne vous fait-il pas réfléchir, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame] ?
Don't you wonder what's happening to your precious Vana'diel?${prompt};Cela ne vous trouble-t-il pas ce que vous voyez ?${prompt}
Like it or not, it would seem you've been chosen.;Ne vous demandez-vous pas ce qui arrive à votre précieuse Vana'diel ?${prompt}
Chosen by the echo of the crystal.${prompt};Qu'on le veuille ou non, il semblerait que vous ayez été choisi.
Chosen for what, you ask?;Choisi par l'écho du cristal.${prompt}
That's not for me to say...${prompt};Choisi pour quoi, vous demandez ?
Sure, you could just turn and walk away from your fate.;Ce n'est pas à moi de le dire...${prompt}
But if you care for the future of your world, seek out the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, and the ${item-singular: 2[2]}...${prompt};Bien sûr, vous pourriez simplement tourner le dos et vous éloigner de votre destin.
What are they? Why, the rays of light you just saw, of course. Or what remains of them, at least.;Mais si vous tenez à l'avenir de votre monde, cherchez le ${item-singular: 0[2]}, le ${item-singular: 1[2]}, et le ${item-singular: 2[2]}...${prompt}
Raining down from the heavens, they settled in forests, marshes, and mountains...${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Eh bien, les rayons de lumière que vous venez de voir, bien sûr. Ou ce qu'il en reste, au moins.
Where did the crystal come from?;Tombant du ciel, ils se sont installés dans les forêts, les marais et les montagnes...${prompt}
For what purpose has it come to our world?${prompt};D'où vient le cristal ?
Open your ears to the echo of the ancient melody...${prompt};Dans quel but est-il venu dans notre monde ?${prompt}
And you just might find the answers you seek.${prompt};Ouvrez vos oreilles à l'écho de l'ancienne mélodie...${prompt}
I'll be waiting for you at Qufim Island.;Et vous pourriez bien trouver les réponses que vous cherchez.${prompt}
Bring the shards to me there, and we will see what mysteries they hold.${prompt};Je vous attendrai à l'île de Qufim.
And now, you'd best be on your way, adventurer.;Apportez-moi les éclats là-bas, et nous verrons quels mystères ils détiennent.${prompt}
It would appear that the wheels have long since been set in motion.${prompt};Et maintenant, vous feriez mieux de vous mettre en route, aventurier.
By the way, you can call me Aldo.${prompt};Il semblerait que les rouages soient en mouvement depuis longtemps.${prompt}
You? Oh, I know you all too well, ${name-player}.;Au fait, vous pouvez m'appeler Aldo.${prompt}
Do take care, now.${prompt};Vous ? Oh, je vous connais très bien, ${name-player}.

Us Moblins built it, y'see.;
What's that? Ye wanna know where it leads?${prompt};
Ohohoho... I could jus' tell ye.;
But it'd be more fun t'make ye guess first.${prompt};

So, which is it?;
${selection-lines};
1. The Moblins' underground hideout.;

Got ye, didn't I? Humor's important, y'see.;
First rule o' Moblin business: a laughin' customer is a buyin' customer!;
...Ye may want to write that one down.${prompt};
We call ourselves the Moblin Maze Mongers.;
Purveyors of meticulously designed, made-t'order mazes for discernin' adventurers like yerself.;
And we're open fer business!${prompt};
How do we operate? Couldn't be simpler, I tell ye.;
Ye gives us an order, and our veteran excavation team brings yer dream dungeon t' life!${prompt};
That's right! We Moblins are takin' our centuries o' experience diggin' and delvin' in Movalpolos 'n puttin' it t'work for ye!;
Precision architecture. Comprehensive maintenance.${prompt};
Safe 'n secure, the possibilities limitless!;
That's the Maze Mongers' guarantee, comin' to ye from none other 'n Goldagrik, the visionary mind behind this ground-breakin' endeavor!;
With plans t'open franchises 'cross the three nations, Moblin Maze Mongers will rule the--${prompt};
<Ahem>... 'Pologies fer that...;
There I go gettin' carried away with m'self again.${prompt};
Anyhow, t' place an order, ye'll be needin' these.;
If ye've got any questions, ye know who t'ask.;
Ol' Goldagrik'll tell ye everythin' ye need t'know!${prompt};
Cleaned out yer rucksack, have ye?;
Well, here ye go then.${prompt};
Oho... I knew ye'd come. Ol' Goldagrik can smell a customer from leagues away.;
Welcome t' Moblin Maze Mongers' base o' operations!${prompt};
While I'd love nothin' more than t'give ye a tour o' our facilities m'self, I'm a busy Moblin.;
So why don't ye take a look through this here manual?;
It should tell ye everythin' y'need to know 'bout our marvelous made-to-order mazes!${prompt};
The weighty manual reads “Feeling lost in the labyrinth of life? Let Moblin Maze Mongers build the maze of your dreams!”, and is divided into numerous chapters.${prompt};
Which chapter will you read?;
${selection-lines};
About “Moblin Maze Mongers.”;
Ordering Your Maze.;
Enjoying Your Maze.;
Rules and Regulations.;
About Moblin Marbles.;
Cave Conservation (C.C.) points.;
Your current C.C. points.;
(Close the book.)${prompt};
Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm!;
Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!${prompt};
Use one of our state-of-the-art “Maze Tabulae” to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!${prompt};
Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!${prompt};
The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers.;
With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!${prompt};
So what are you waiting for?;
Let Moblin Maze Mongers build you the maze of your dreams--or nightmares--today!${prompt};
Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless!;
With three simple-to-use items--“Maze Tabulae,” “Maze Vouchers,” and “Maze Runes”--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.${prompt};
The first and most important of these items is the “Maze Tabula,” which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.${prompt};
Next you have the “Maze Voucher,” a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.${prompt};
After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications.;
However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.${prompt};
You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not!;
That's where “Maze Runes” come in.;
The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects.;
Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!${prompt};
You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.${prompt};
Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes.;
Please manipulate your Maze Runes as necessary so that they do not touch any black squares.${prompt};
Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with.;
Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.${prompt};
The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula.;
Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.${prompt};
After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.${prompt};
Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!${prompt};
Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per ${choice: 0}[twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt};
However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers.;
Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.${prompt};
This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!${prompt};
After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby.;
Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.${prompt};
During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities.;
You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.${prompt};
After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze.;
The challenge begins!${prompt};
Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze.;
What myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!${prompt};
After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze.;
You may do so by any one of the following methods:${prompt};
”Leaving From the Exit”;
Each maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity.;
If spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.${prompt};
Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.${prompt};
“Using a ${item-singular: 0[2]}”;
A complimentary ${item-singular: 0[2]} will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze.;
Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.${prompt};
“Emergency Extraction”;
Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.${prompt};
Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze!;
Happy spelunking!${prompt};
Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.${prompt};
Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.${prompt};
Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze.;
Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.${prompt};
Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels.;
Note, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.${prompt};
We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties.;
While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.${prompt};
Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work.;
Please understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.${prompt};
In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety.;
Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.${prompt};
In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called “Moblin Marbles” as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.${prompt};
These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!${prompt};
How about a nice, shiny one of these?${prompt};
Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?${prompt};
Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!${prompt};
And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits!;
These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.${prompt};
Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!${prompt};
There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now.;
Jus' come back here if ye need t'look at it again.${prompt};
Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye?${wait-36: 1};
Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types.;
Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?${prompt};
Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers!;
We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!${prompt};
With great success, though, comes great responsibility!;
Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible.;
Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.${prompt};
At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first!;
How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound?;
Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!${prompt};
Customers will receive their first C.C. point ${choice: 0}[thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every ${choice: 0}[eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter.;
A maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.${prompt};
And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what!;
Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.${prompt};
Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze.;
Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.${prompt};
Let's see here...;
Looks like ye've got yerself ${number: 0} C.C. ${choice-plurality: 0}[point/points].${prompt};
Me called Duplidoc.;
Mazes, mazes everywhere. I see them all.;
Ya want something from me?${prompt};
What do you want?;
${selection-lines};
Never mind!;
View copiable mazes.;
Register your Maze Tabula.;
Tell me more.${prompt};
New maze opens up, I visit. Never miss one.;
You want to see the mazes I've seen?;
I make you copy...for price.${prompt};
My copies good as real thing. Maybe better.;
But I make too many, Goldagrik yell at me.;
Say bad for business.;
So you can only use copy five times max, okay?${prompt};
Or maybe you a maze maker yourself?;

Ah, ${name-player}. I've been waiting for you.${prompt};
My people have returned from their reconnaissance mission in Windurst. The situation is worse than we had feared.${prompt};
A representative from the Federation is due to arrive here any minute now for further talks.${prompt};
W-we have an emergency-ethy on our hands!;
Now, before-ethy I proceed, please be reminded that not a single word spoken here today must be allowed to leave-ethy this room.${prompt};
If what my investigation has revealed is true-ethy, we have a major crisis looming.${prompt};
A teleportation mishap-ethy has resulted in the creation of a clone-ethy of Doctor Shantotto!${prompt};
Wh-what? As if one Doctor Shantotto wasn't already a handful, now we have to contend with two!?${prompt};
Of all the Goddess-forsaken incidents...${prompt};
And to rub-ethy salt into the wound, the evil tendencies exhibited by the newly created clone are such-ethy that they put the original doctor to shame-ethy!${prompt};
“Domina Shantotto,” she has taken-ethy to calling herself, though this you may already know-ethy.;
Ever since her appearance-ethy, she hasn't wasted a second to enact her malicious machinations!${prompt};
Oh, my poor, tired head-ethy...${prompt};
If word-ethy gets out to the other nations, Windurst will become the laughingstock-ethy of the two continents!;
But that's the least of our worries right now-ethy.${prompt};
Had only I heeded Principal Koru-Moru's warnings...;
Oh, the Goddess strike-ethy me down for a fool!${prompt};
To avoid raising alarm bells, we've planted a life-size talking doll-ethy of the doctor at her abode and imbued it with a personality that's equally abrasive-ethy, but the people won't be fooled for long.${prompt};
We must act, and act fast-ethy, lest all of this becomes public knowledge and mass panic-ethy grips the land!${prompt};
Certainly not the kind of predicament you want to get dragged into should you wish to live to a ripe old age...;
But as much as I'm loath to admit it, we--myself and all adventurers included--are already involved up to our necks.${prompt};
Whatever devious scheme that Domina Shantotto is plotting, it would be naive to assume that she has any less than the whole of Vana'diel in her sights.${prompt};
Now, I think it's safe to say that we're all agreed that action must be taken.${prompt};
But what should our first step be to avert this clear and present danger?${prompt};
Let me first tell-ethy you what else I know.${prompt};
Upon learning of the teleportation mishap-ethy, I sought to locate the whereabouts of the original-ethy Doctor Shantotto. I deduced that the clone-ethy might have had a hand in her disappearance.${prompt};
And sure-ethy enough, my sources have revealed that the original doctor is being held captive-ethy somewhere in Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
I propose-ethy that our first act is the rescue of “Original Shantotto”--for the sake of convenience, let's call-ethy her by this moniker for the time being.${prompt};
Ah, I see where you're going with this: fight fire with fire!${prompt};
It sounds like our best bet. The odds would be greatly improved if we had the original Shantotto fighting on our side.${prompt};
${name-player}, I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in this.${prompt};
Let's be on our way!${prompt};
I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in rescuing the original Doctor Shantotto.${prompt};
According to Professor Yoran-Oran, the doctor is being held captive in Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
“A perfect world order...${prompt};
...that exists solely for our pleasure”!?${prompt};
Does that witch's derangement know no bounds!?${prompt};
<Puff...wheeze...>;
Th-the doctor's location-ethy! I have it!${prompt};
As a last resort, I employed the services of Windurst's infamous Cat Burglar-ethy, Nanaa Mihgo, to locate Doctor Shantotto.${prompt};
And true-ethy to her reputation, she's successfully tracked down the doctor's current hideout-ethy: the Sacrificial Chamber within the Temple of Uggalepih!${prompt};
The only hitch-ethy is--and acquiring this piece of information further lightened my coin purse-ethy--ancient artifacts known as “Tablets of Hexes” are required for entry. They can supposedly be found-ethy scattered throughout the temple and deeper within.${prompt};
Ah, yes. The Cat Burglar has never been one to lose scent of her prey.${prompt};
So the next leg of our journey takes us to Elshimo Island...${prompt};
By means fair or foul, we must put an end to Shantotto's nefarious plot.${prompt};
Vana'diel must not be allowed to fall into such tyrannical hands!${prompt};
But first, there are matters I must attend to in Jeuno.;
I must ensure that the Tenshodo isn't left leaderless should...should the worst come to pass.${prompt};
One can't expect to lock horns with a fearsome adversary like the doctor and come out unscathed.${prompt};
Very well-ethy. Let us rendezvous at the Sacrificial Chamber.;
There are matters I must settle here first before departure.;
The Tenshodo mustn't be left leaderless should the worst come to pass.${prompt};
Go on ahead to the Sacrificial Chamber. I will join you there shortly.${prompt};
Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me.;
I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.${prompt};

Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt};
It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.;
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.;
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;

What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};Bienvenue au service de porteur de l'MHMU, kupo !
Do something, kupo?;Quel fardeau de vos biens puis-je prendre en charge aujourd'hui ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Besoin d'aide, kupo ?
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;Service de porteur ?
No, thank you.${prompt};Acheter un bon pour le stockage.
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;Non, merci.${prompt}
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};Votre gobbiebag déborde-t-il de ses coutures ? Votre Mog Safe déborde-t-il ?
That's where I come in, kupo.;Eh bien, un aventurier accompli comme vous a sûrement plus de choses qu'il ne sait qu'en faire.${prompt}
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};C'est là que j'interviens, kupo.
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};Je me ferai un plaisir de garder vos biens précieux, vous laissant de l'espace pour rassembler encore de plus grands trésors.${prompt}
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};Pour profiter de mes services, vous devrez d’abord acheter l’un de ces bons pour le stockage pour le modique montant de ${number: 19} gils, kupo.${prompt}
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};Les bons pour le stockage sont disponibles dans de nombreuses variétés, kupo, chacune correspondant à un type différent d'objet.${prompt}
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};Vous voudrez examiner de près les petits caractères, afin de ne pas dépenser de bons gils pour un bout de parchemin inutile pour l'objet particulier que vous souhaitez stocker.${prompt}
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;Bien que nous, les moogles, ne nous opposions pas à ce genre de don, kupo.${prompt}
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};Choisissez l'objet que vous souhaitez confier, puis échangez-le avec moi ainsi qu'un seul bon pour le stockage.
Invisible to you, at least.;Je prendrai l'objet et vous retournerai le bon, marqué d'un sceau invisible.${prompt}
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};Invisible pour vous, du moins.
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};C'est clair comme de l'eau de roche pour nous, les moogles, alors ne pensez même pas à essayer de nous berner, kupo.${prompt}
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;Lorsqu'il sera temps de récupérer votre objet, échangez simplement avec moi un seul bon pour le stockage -- n'importe quel bon -- une fois de plus.${prompt}
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};Je vous présenterai une liste de tous les objets actuellement sous ma garde, et vous pourrez choisir celui que vous souhaitez retirer.
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;Aussi simple que cela, kupo !${prompt}
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};De plus, aucun frais de transaction supplémentaire ne sera engagé !
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;Plutôt généreux de notre part pour une fois, non ?${prompt}
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};Maintenant, je parie que vous vous demandez quel est le piège, kupo.
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};Pour ne pas vous décevoir, il y en a quelques-uns !${prompt}
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;Pour commencer, tous les objets signés perdront leurs signatures si vous les stockez avec moi.${prompt}
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};Pourquoi, dites-vous ? Hé, même nous, les moogles, ne sommes pas parfaits !
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};Il vaut mieux pour nous deux que vous gardiez vos possessions les plus précieuses à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;Maintenant, écoutez bien, car il y a un autre piège, et c'est un gros.${prompt}
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;Si vous perdez votre bon pour le stockage, je ne pourrai pas vous rendre votre objet. Jamais. Pas de si, de et de mais !
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};"Pas de ""Je suis désolé, Monsieur Moogle Porteur, cela ne se reproduira jamais !"""
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};Les règles sont les règles, kupo, et quelqu'un doit les respecter.${prompt}
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};Enfin, mais non des moindres, je ne peux pas accepter d'équipement portant l'insigne d'essai de Magian.${prompt}
And that's all there is to it.;Si vous avez un tel objet que vous mourrez d'envie de me confier, vous devrez abandonner votre essai d'abord, kupo.${prompt}
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};Et c'est tout.
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;Ce modeste moogle a hâte de vous servir !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Acheter quelque chose ? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).

As part of the application process, you will need this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Merci pour votre intérêt pour notre programme de partenariat pionnier.${prompt}
Take it with you and visit one of the dungeons from the list that I am about to give you. Which one you visit is your choice.${prompt};Dans le cadre du processus de candidature, vous aurez besoin de ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Our survey staff has inspected each of the areas in question and placed special markings at a particular location past the entrance.${prompt};Prenez-le avec vous et visitez l'un des donjons de la liste que je m'apprête à vous donner. Lequel vous visitez est votre choix.${prompt}
Hold up the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have just given you and return it to me.${prompt};Notre équipe d'experts a inspecté chacune des zones en question et a placé des marques spéciales à un endroit particulier après l'entrée.${prompt}

I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor.${prompt};Certains de ces repères sont situés près de l'entrée, tandis que d'autres sont plus profonds à l'intérieur.${prompt}
The government of Jeuno has promulgated a system for adventurers to pioneer uncharted lands.${prompt};Je vous souhaite bonne chance dans cette entreprise.${prompt}
This system was proposed by the leaders of the Sacred City of Adoulin, an overseas trading capital whose volume of trade rivals Jeuno's.${prompt};Le gouvernement de Jeuno a promulgué un système permettant aux aventuriers de pionniers des terres inexplorées.${prompt}
Pioneers are to traverse the waters of the Sea of Zafmlug, far to the west, and assist in colonizing the untamed wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt};Ce système a été proposé par les dirigeants de la Ville Sacrée d'Adoulin, une capitale commerciale d'outre-mer dont le volume d'échanges rivalise avec celui de Jeuno.${prompt}
Once word of this proposal reached San d'Oria through various trade routes, it introduced Jeuno to the idea, which led to its eventual implementation.${prompt};Les pionniers sont appelés à traverser les eaux de la Mer de Zafmlug, loin à l'ouest, et à aider à coloniser les terres sauvages d'Ulbuka.${prompt}
Adoulin is not a place for the weak or uninitiated. Harsh wildlands surround the city, and simple layfolk stand no chance of surviving. It is due to these unique circumstances that Adoulin has begun recruiting highly seasoned adventurers to assist in seeing out its goals.${prompt};Lorsque cette proposition est parvenue à San d'Oria par diverses routes commerciales, elle a introduit Jeuno à l'idée, ce qui a conduit à sa mise en œuvre.${prompt}
Here at the Consultation Desk, we issue permits that allow proactive adventurers to cross over to Adoulin.${prompt};Adoulin n'est pas un endroit pour les faibles ou les non-initiés. Des terres sauvages impitoyables entourent la ville, et les simples laïcs n'ont aucune chance de survie. C'est en raison de ces circonstances uniques qu'Adoulin a commencé à recruter des aventuriers hautement expérimentés pour l'aider à atteindre ses objectifs.${prompt}
However, neophytes cannot provide the services Adoulin requires. As such, the Chamber has commissioned a simple test for those seeking to make the perilous journey.${prompt};Ici, au Bureau de Consultation, nous délivrons des permis permettant aux aventuriers proactifs de passer à Adoulin.${prompt}
Those seasoned in battle should find it to be a relatively painless affair.${prompt};Cependant, les néophytes ne peuvent pas fournir les services qu'Adoulin demande. En conséquence, la Chambre a commandé un test simple pour ceux qui souhaitent entreprendre le voyage périlleux.${prompt}
Adoulin has prepared a multitude of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, of which one will be given to each adventurer seeking to prove their worth.${prompt};Ceux qui sont chevronnés dans le combat devraient trouver cela relativement indolore.${prompt}
These ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the land, and are able to record markings located in specific locations. Further details will be provided once we have issued you the appropriate certifications.${prompt};Adoulin a préparé une multitude de ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, dont une sera remise à chaque aventurier cherchant à prouver sa valeur.${prompt}
For the time being, let us return to the task you will have to face.${prompt};Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} sont accordés à la terre et sont capables d’enregistrer des repères situés à des emplacements spécifiques. Des détails supplémentaires seront fournis une fois que nous vous aurons délivré les certifications appropriées.${prompt}
Bring this object with you and take it to one out of a list of several areas located throughout Vana'diel. Which place you choose to explore is for you to decide.${prompt};Pour l'instant, revenons à la tâche que vous aurez à affronter.${prompt}
You must simply pass the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over the markings located in the area to finish your assignment.${prompt};Apportez cet objet avec vous et emmenez-le dans l'une des plusieurs zones réparties dans tout Vana'diel. Le choix de l'endroit que vous souhaitez explorer vous appartient.${prompt}
Once you have completed this task, simply return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to us here and we will analyze the results.${prompt};Il vous suffit de passer le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sur les marques situées dans la zone pour terminer votre mission.${prompt}
Should your trial be completed appropriately, you will be deemed to have passed, and will be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, enabling you to travel to Adoulin.${prompt};Une fois cette tâche terminée, il vous suffit de nous rapporter le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ici et nous analyserons les résultats.${prompt}
That should constitute a sufficient explanation. Should you choose to undertake the test, I wish you the greatest of fortunes.${prompt};Si votre épreuve est menée à bien, vous serez considéré comme ayant réussi et vous recevrez ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ce qui vous permettra de voyager jusqu’à Adoulin.${prompt}
As you may remember, the test requires you to visit one of several different dungeons.${prompt};Cela devrait constituer une explication suffisante. Si vous choisissez de passer le test, je vous souhaite la meilleure des chances.${prompt}
To be quite frank, we have received a large number of signatures from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Evidently, what with all the adventurers coming and going, they need some help with non-battle activities as well.${prompt};Comme vous vous en souviendrez peut-être, le test consiste à visiter l'un des différents donjons.${prompt}
Given that, the committee deliberated day and night to come up with a solution. As a result of this grueling debacle, an executive decision was made to issue special tickets for the price of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};Pour être tout à fait franc, nous avons reçu un grand nombre de signatures de la part du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers. Manifestement, avec tous les aventuriers qui vont et viennent, ils ont également besoin d'aide pour des activités non combatives.${prompt}
The committee based its judgment on the idea that accumulating funds is yet another sign of a stalwart adventurer.${prompt};Compte tenu de cela, le comité a délibéré jour et nuit pour trouver une solution. À la suite de cette difficile délibération, une décision exécutive a été prise d’émettre des billets spéciaux au prix de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}
After all, Adoulin is a city of maritime trade, just like our beloved Jeuno. We recognize that it welcomes business skill in all its forms, without regard to race or creed.${prompt};Le comité a fondé son jugement sur l'idée que l'accumulation de fonds est un autre signe d'un aventurier intrépide.${prompt}
As I have previously mentioned, issuing ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will incur a fee of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};Après tout, Adoulin est une ville de commerce maritime, tout comme notre bien-aimée Jeuno. Nous reconnaissons qu'elle accueille les compétences commerciales sous toutes leurs formes, sans distinction de race ou de croyance.${prompt}
Begin filling out the paperwork?${prompt};Comme je l’ai mentionné précédemment, l’émission de ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} entraînera des frais de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}
Pay for the issuance of your documents?;Commencer à remplir les formalités ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Payer pour l'émission de vos documents ?
No time like the present!;
I need more time to think.${prompt};Il n'y a pas de moment comme le présent !
Are you sure?${prompt};J'ai besoin de plus de temps pour réfléchir.${prompt}
Ready for issuance?;Êtes-vous sûr ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Prêt pour l'émission ?
You bet!;
Not quite.${prompt};Absolument !
Unfortunately, you do not appear to have the required gil. Please come back once you can pay the handling fee.${prompt};Pas tout à fait.${prompt}
Let me see...dot the I's here, cross the T's there...and...we are finished. Here is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Malheureusement, vous ne semblez pas avoir le gil nécessaire. Revenez une fois que vous pourrez payer les frais de traitement.${prompt}
There is one more thing. Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with you.${prompt};Voyons voir... ponctuez les i ici, croisez les t là... et... nous avons terminé. Voici votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
It will let you teleport to Adoulin. You may have noticed that there is a mystic portal located here in Lower Jeuno. That will lead you there.${prompt};Il y a encore une chose. Prenez également ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec vous.${prompt}
These ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} record founts of power in specific places and allow instantaneous travel between two locations.${prompt};Cela vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin. Vous avez peut-être remarqué qu'il y a un portail mystique situé ici à Basse Jeuno. Celui-ci vous mènera là-bas.${prompt}
I have been informed that this form of transportation is called “warping.”${prompt};Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} enregistrent des sources de puissance en des endroits spécifiques et permettent un voyage instantané entre deux lieux.${prompt}
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have presented you with is already attuned to the locus in Lower Jeuno and to Western Adoulin.${prompt};"On m'a informé que cette forme de transport s'appelle le ""warping"".${prompt}"
Passing it over the surface of the portal will enable you to warp to Adoulin.${prompt};Le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai présenté est déjà accordé au lieu à Basse Jeuno et à l’ouest d’Adoulin.${prompt}
"Warping is not free, however; the process requires a certain type of energy.${prompt}";Le faire passer sur la surface du portail vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin.${prompt}
According to my materials, trading crystals to a waypoint will convert them into energy. This process is called “charging.”${prompt};"Cependant, le Warping n'est pas gratuit ; le processus nécessite un certain type d'énergie.${prompt}"
The energy, referred to as “kinetic units,” is recorded on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have given you.${prompt};"Selon mes informations, échanger des cristaux contre un waypoint les convertira en énergie. Ce processus s'appelle le ""charging"".${prompt}"
Utilizing the waypoints will deplete a portion of these kinetic units each time, so I recommend periodic recharging.${prompt};"L’énergie, appelée ""unités cinétiques"", est enregistrée sur le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai donné.${prompt}"
It says here that all I have imparted to you may be reviewed at any time from any waypoint.${prompt};Utiliser les waypoints épuisera une partie de ces unités cinétiques à chaque fois, je recommande donc une recharge périodique.${prompt}
Of course, in consideration of all your help, the one I have given you is fully charged. I hope that you put it to good use.${prompt};Il est indiqué ici que tout ce que je vous ai transmis peut être consulté à tout moment à partir de n'importe quel point de passage.${prompt}
That is all the information with which I can provide you. Your adventures in Adoulin will be what you make of them--and we have high hopes you will make a positive contribution to the development of the nation and the success of the pioneering initiative.${prompt};Bien sûr, en considération de toute votre aide, celui que je vous ai donné est entièrement chargé. J'espère que vous en ferez bon usage.${prompt}
Our records show that you have already declared your desire to participate in the initiative.${prompt};C'est toutes les informations que je peux vous fournir. Vos aventures à Adoulin dépendront de ce que vous en ferez, et nous espérons que vous apporterez une contribution positive au développement de la nation et au succès de l'initiative pionnière.${prompt}
When we issue your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, we will collect your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Make sure you choose your path wisely.${prompt};Nos archives montrent que vous avez déjà déclaré votre désir de participer à l'initiative.${prompt}
Allow me to explain the initiative to you in further detail.${prompt};Lorsque nous émettrons votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, nous collecterons votre ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Assurez-vous de choisir votre chemin judicieusement.${prompt}
You wish for me to examine your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, correct? Then please, let me take a look.${prompt};Permettez-moi de vous expliquer l'initiative plus en détail.${prompt}
...${prompt};Vous souhaitez que j’examine votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, n’est-ce pas ? Alors s’il vous plaît, laissez-moi jeter un œil.${prompt}
Having analyzed the sample you retrieved, we are pleased to inform you that you have passed the test.${prompt};
I shall now return your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to you.${prompt};Après avoir analysé l'échantillon que vous avez récupéré, nous sommes heureux de vous informer que vous avez réussi le test.${prompt}
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is attuned not just to the location you visited, but also to locations throughout Adoulin.${prompt};Je vais maintenant vous rendre votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
We have a task that we would like to request of all adventurers who possess ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};Votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est accordé non seulement à l’emplacement que vous avez visité, mais aussi à des emplacements à travers Adoulin.${prompt}
This request comes directly from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, with the reward to be paid out by them as well.${prompt};Nous avons une tâche que nous aimerions demander à tous les aventuriers qui possèdent ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
The content of this request is simple. The Association wants adventurers to record loci of power for them using the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Of course, they are indeed aware that different adventurers will have different wants and priorities.${prompt};Cette demande provient directement du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers, avec la récompense à être versée par eux également.${prompt}
In order to support adventurers whose skills are best utilized outside the field of battle, the Association is searching for people to attune these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} in their stead.${prompt};Le contenu de cette demande est simple. L’Association veut que les aventuriers enregistrent des lieux de pouvoir pour eux en utilisant le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Bien sûr, ils sont conscients que différents aventuriers auront des envies et des priorités différentes.${prompt}
Will you accept this task?${prompt};Afin de soutenir les aventuriers dont les compétences sont mieux utilisées en dehors du champ de bataille, l’Association recherche des personnes pour accorder ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} à leur place.${prompt}
How about it?;Acceptez-vous cette tâche ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Sounds like a good time!;
Nah, not for me.${prompt};Ça a l'air amusant !
I'm sure the Association appreciates your assistance in this matter. Here is the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} they would like you to use.${prompt};Non, pas pour moi.${prompt}
Thank you for your outstanding work. Here is the reward the Association has set aside for you.${prompt};Je suis sûr que l’Association apprécie votre aide dans cette affaire. Voici le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} qu’ils aimeraient que vous utilisiez.${prompt}
Additionally, I will make sure that your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} gets sent to the proper authorities.${prompt};Merci pour votre travail exceptionnel. Voici la récompense que l'Association a réservée pour vous.${prompt}
Hmm...I see here in the files that you have already accepted this request. Would you like to cancel?${prompt};De plus, je veillerai à ce que votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} soit envoyé aux autorités compétentes.${prompt}
Abandon the quest or press forward?;Hmm... Je vois ici dans les fichiers que vous avez déjà accepté cette demande. Souhaitez-vous l'annuler ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Abandonner la quête ou continuer ?
I suppose it's not my thing.;
I'm not giving up that easily!${prompt};Je suppose que ce n'est pas pour moi.
I am sorry to hear that. If that is the case, then I must ask that you return your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. The Association was truly looking forward to working with you.${prompt};Je n'abandonne pas si facilement !${prompt}
You returned your Key Item: ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the clerk.${prompt};Je suis désolé d’apprendre cela. Si c’est le cas, je dois vous demander de restituer votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. L’Association était vraiment impatiente de travailler avec vous.${prompt}

Somehow I don't think he meant for us to have this.;
What could he possibly be on about?${prompt};
Boss, if Cid were to find out about this...${prompt};
Oh, I know all too well. His rage would be the least of our worries. Mid might even get himself expelled from Adoulin entirely.${prompt};
But we shouldn't stick our noses where they don't belong.${prompt};
This whole affair must never leave these walls. Consider that to be a direct order.${prompt};
That goes for you too, ${name-player}. Pretend this whole thing didn't happen.${prompt};
I'll hold on to this. Nothing good could come of giving it back to Mid.${prompt};
Now, about those explosives--we'll have to do some research on our own before we give a definitive answer. That's our official response.${prompt};
So head back to Adoulin and let Midras know...only what he needs to know. And don't get in over your head, hear?${prompt};

(Why would I keep this information secret when I could sell it to Cid for untold amounts of gil?)${prompt};

What do you want? Oh, I see you've got your eyes on my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It's imbued with the power of a rune generated by the Strange Apparatus in ${zone: 1[2]}.${prompt};
There are many other weapons imbued with the power of runes. Of course, I own all of the ones that can be equipped.${prompt};

As for the ones I can't equip, the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and the ${item-singular: 6[2]}, I was able to sell it for a pretty good price at the bazaar.${prompt};
At any rate, it was worth the trouble of decoding the device's password.${prompt};
What do you want to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
The Strange Apparatus.;
The password.;
Tell me the password.;
Farewell.${prompt};
See you around.${prompt};
Huh? You mean you've never heard of a Strange Apparatus?${prompt};
They're a type of mysterious device hidden in ${zone: 1[2]} as well as ${zone: 2[2]} and ${zone: 3[2]}, among other places.${prompt};
Of course, I have no idea what such things are doing in caves, ruins, and the like.${prompt};
A password is necessary in order to grant you doctor status, which provides you with the necessary access privileges for the device.${prompt};
You can then place materials in the device to generate ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Of course, you're not always guaranteed to get a weapon.${prompt};
Once you obtain the necessary access privileges, though, it boosts the chances a weapon will be synthesized, if only by a little bit.${prompt};
Huh? You want me to just give you the password I worked so hard to crack?${prompt};
That's a secret I risked my life against deadly elementals to learn.${prompt};
There's no way I could just tell you for free. Now, if we could agree on suitable compensation...${prompt};
Actually, you need MP to wield this weapon properly.${prompt};
For a Galkan warrior like myself, it's a constant struggle to keep up the necessary MP.${prompt};
So, if you can bring me ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, I suppose I could tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt};
Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt};
Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt};
First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt};
The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt};
Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt};
If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt};
Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt};
For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt};
If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt};
Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt};
I suppose it's still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you're trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt};
The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt};
Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt};
That means the first three values are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}.${prompt};
The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt};
The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 4}. However, since it exceeds 100, the value becomes ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt};
Putting all of these values together gives you ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}, which is your password to register your access privileges with the device.${prompt};
Did you get all that?${prompt};
Got it?;
${selection-lines};
No problem!;
I'm not very good with numbers.${prompt};
Okay then. Now you know how to find your password.${prompt};
As for what materials to place in the device, you'll need to research that for yourself.${prompt};
Were you even paying attention? Fine, I'll give you the short version.${prompt};
Tell me. Which area are you planning to register in?${prompt};
Where are you planning to register?;
${selection-lines};
${zone: 0[2]}.;
${zone: 1[2]}.;
${zone: 2[2]}.;
${zone: 3[2]}.;
${zone: 4[2]}.;
${zone: 5[2]}.;
${zone: 6[2]}.;
${zone: 7[2]}.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Give me a moment while I make the necessary calculations.${prompt};
Okay, I've got it. Your password for registering your access privileges with the device in ${zone: 6[2]} is ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt};
Now hurry up and get over there before you forget it.${prompt};
Very well. Come see me again when you decide on a location.${prompt};
What do you want?${prompt};
What do you want to ask?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me how to calculate the password.;
Just tell me the password.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Oh... You're the one I recently told how to obtain the password.${prompt};
It seems you were able to receive the necessary access privileges for the device.${prompt};
It seems like we have quite a bit in common.${prompt};
There's no use trying to hide it. I could tell by the way you were looking at my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You managed to receive the necessary access privileges with the Strange Apparatus. Am I right?${prompt};
If so, I've got some interesting news for you. Care to hear it?${prompt};
Do you want to hear the info?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
No thanks.${prompt};
I see... In that case, farewell.${prompt};
Hehe... I thought you might want to hear this.${prompt};
You've been granted access privileges, so I'm sure you already know this, but there are other Strange Apparatuses that haven't been activated yet.${prompt};
Apparently, the device in ${zone: 1[2]} just became operational recently.${prompt};
Upon hearing the rumors, I went to check it out for myself...${prompt};
However, it asked me for a new password.${prompt};
I suppose it's requiring us to register for access privileges granted to those a rank above doctor status...${prompt};
I'm assuming that the values for the name are the same, and only the elemental value has changed, but I still haven't figured it out yet.${prompt};
If you manage to figure it out before I do, maybe you could give me a hint on how to crack the password.${prompt};
I'm sure it'll be fairly difficult, but I'd appreciate the help.${prompt};
Huh? Did you manage to figure out the new password!?${prompt};
I see... It looks like you beat me to it.${prompt};
So, enough with the suspense... What's the secret?${prompt};
Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.${prompt};
I remember how I felt when I cracked the secret for the doctor-level password.${prompt};
It was tough, but the sheer joy I felt after it was over was worth it in the end.${prompt};
I would hate to have that sense of accomplishment taken away from me.${prompt};
If you could figure it out, I know I can too. Just you wait.${prompt};
Instead of the elemental value, I could take this... And then if I add that to the total...${prompt};
Hey, have you heard the rumors that the device in ${zone: 1[2]} is operational?${prompt};
I see. I was trying to figure out the secret behind its password.${prompt};
Sorry, I'm too busy to talk right now. Maybe come back later when I've figured it out.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} showed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
Hmm... This is...${prompt};
I had heard that it was related to some ancient technology, but now it all makes sense...${prompt};
I suppose your intention here is to use the A.M.A.N. to have its adventurers solve the riddle.${prompt};
As such, I suppose it's best if I give you free reign to operate, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Just to be safe, I'll be sure to keep an eye on their movements as well.${prompt};
Impressive as always, ${name-player}. You expertly solved that riddle that had vexed so many others.${prompt};
I knew it was only a matter of time, but it's good to see that everything went according to expectations.${prompt};
Well, leave the rest of this to me. I'll try to find out more about this most unusual device.${prompt};

Ah, this almost slipped my mind.;
Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.${prompt};
Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.${prompt};
Thanks to your donation, I now have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} in safekeeping.${prompt};
Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.;
Hold your hoarder hares, ${choice-player-gender}[hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer.;
Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.${prompt};
Oh, crud, that's right.;
You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
“Why?” What a good question!;
Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.${prompt};
Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you.${prompt};
You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?;
Let me wake up from my catnap first...${wait-36: 1};
Alright, now rrread this.${prompt};
Wait, wait, wait!;
If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.${prompt};
Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...${prompt};
...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.${prompt};
Grrreat! Now I have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you. Thanks!${prompt};
Hm?;
Oh, spark exchange... Of course.;
I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.${prompt};
Let me add one thing.;
Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
I'll make it worth your while...I swear!;
Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.${prompt};
Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} for you.${prompt};

You're that adventurer who's not entirely-wirely unknown for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] feats in Records of Eminence, right?${prompt};
If I recall correctaruly, your name is...${name-player}?${prompt};
Is that your name?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, ma'am.;
Nope, wrong person.;
My name's Kam'lanaut, jerk.${prompt};
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't meant to holdy-wold you up. Carry on.${prompt};
What did you say? Sorry, I'm hardly fluentaru in stupid.${prompt};
I knew it, now here's the dossier of objective data. Make sure you don't look this giftaru chocobo in the mouth.${prompt};
What? You can't do this alone?${prompt};
Ugh, are you so mentaruly deficient that you haven't even heard of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network?${prompt};
Lessee... A simple explanation for a simpleton...;
For example, you know those tomes that floataru outside the city, right?${prompt};
A.M.A.N. is the group responsible-wonsible for those and other such adventurer-supporting ideas.${prompt};
Records of Eminence is just another manifestation of A.M.A.N.'s helpful-welpful nature.${prompt};
I'd like to know exactaruly who's dispensing the spoils for completed objectives and why, however.${prompt};
They say that people's greatest fear is the fear of the unknown, which makes sense to me. Why else would my teeth start chattaruing every time I get objectives addressed to me with no sender?${prompt};
Anyway, that's why I'm so gracious-waciously giving this one to you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
...You are going to prove to me that you're a truly valiantaru and brave adventurer, aren't you?${prompt};
Will you prove your worth?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, for no one questions my valor!;
Doing your dirty work won't prove a thing.${prompt};
Fine, then. I'm sure there are hordes of other adventurers chomping-womping at the bit to prove their worth.${prompt};
I knew you'd be back.;
So, are you ready to prove-wove yourself in Records of Eminence?${prompt};
You adventurers can never abide affrontarus to your character, can you?${prompt};
Either way, your objective is to investigate various telepoints. Yeesh, this task is so far beneath a white mage of my caliber-waliber, it isn't even funny.${prompt};
Anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
It's not beneath me.;
Teleport me to them, then.${prompt};
Teleportaru you!?;
Bite me!${prompt};
You've just insulted every hardworking mage everywhere. You need to work for your share, not leech-weech off the kindness of strangers.${prompt};
Excellentaru.;
Just remember to procure gate crystals along the way, lest you look like a fool.${prompt};
Perfectaru.;
It shouldn't give you much trouble, either, as long as you know the spell Teleport.${prompt};
Alright, I'll see you once you've completarued your objective.${prompt};
Your mission, should you choose to remember-wember it, is to investigate the various telepoints scattered throughout Vana'diel.${prompt};
Fine, fine, fine. Let me listaru the ones you've been to:${choice: 0}[/ Holla.]${choice: 1}[/ Dem.]${choice: 2}[/ Mea.]${choice: 3}[/ Altepa.]${choice: 4}[/ Yhoator.]${choice: 5}[/ Vazhl.];
I guess that means you've got ${choice: 6}[/one/two/three/four/five] to go.${prompt};
...Not the ripest pamama in the bunch, I see. You haven't investigated a single-wingle one!${prompt};
I honestly didn't expectaru you to return with such haste.${prompt};
Oh...no...${prompt};
Don't you dare move a finger-winger, or I'll bite you harder than a poison leech!${prompt};
That was Ervie...I mean Ervok.${prompt};
He's my friend, but we haven't adventured together in so long. We've driftarued so far apart that the gap between us is impossible to cross.${prompt};
But now I hear he started teaching-weaching people about Records of Eminence!${prompt};
He even stopped using his real name. Now he goes by the moniker-woniker “Eternal Flame” or something dumb.${prompt};
Back in the old days, the five of us always used to venture forth into the unknown and combataru the forces of evil whenever we got the chance.${prompt};
I still remember how the auction house was always packed, so we'd meet in frontaru of the tavern.${prompt};
Beam me up, Toto!${prompt};
How many times have I told-wold you to stop calling me that!?${prompt};
I am constantly in your debt, Nantoto. Without your superb knowledge of the healing arts, I would never be able to effectively perform as a paladin.${prompt};
I agree! You've got more fighting spirit in your pinky toe than I have in my whole being!${prompt};
Wait, is fighting spirit really necessary when casting magic? I was under the impression that all you need...is love.${prompt};
Yeah, yeah, quit with the non sequitarus already. So, where do you want me to take you?${prompt};
Hmmm, where do I want to wrrreak havoc today...${prompt};
It's not that I hate the spell Teleport. On the contrary, I felt like I was serving a greater purpose-wurpose whenever I used it.${prompt};
I'll never forgetaru the memories of all I did with my friends back then. Countless sunsets have been swallowed by the ocean since I enjoyed using Teleport, but while I may not remember how many sunsets the seas have claimed, those memories are still as vivid as the bluest of skies.${prompt};
...Although they may not mean much now that our friendship has darkened more than the setting sun.${prompt};
C...can I confide something to you?;
...There's another reason-weason I handed over that objective.${prompt};
You might not know this, but...one is the loneliest number to teleportaru.${prompt};
Ugh, forget I said anything!;
It was all an elaborataru lie! Don't listen to my misguided ramblings!${prompt};
More importantly, I should thank you for putting up with my shenanigan-wanigans.${prompt};
Here.;
Now get out of my sightaru!${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}.;
So, how's your inquestaru coming along?${prompt};
<Sniffle>;
I want to ask Rolandienne and the others a favor-wavor, but...${prompt};
...What if they rejectaru my offer?${prompt};
I just know they will, and I'll be devastatarued. Oh, my Goddess, I can feel myself getting depressed just thinking about it.${prompt};
<Sigh>...${prompt};
What timing-wiming you have, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Another one of those strange and horrible-worrible objectives showed up in my name!${prompt};
I don't getaru it at all.;
Why won't they leave me alone!?${prompt};
Moreover, it's a real doozy-woozy. How can a delicataru little flower like me possibly be asked to slay nasty shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis!?${prompt};
You know what? I refuse-wuse to undertake any of these until the person in charge shows himself!${prompt};
...So, ${name-player}, my friend of friends. My buddy of buddies...how about acceptaruing this objective in my stead?${prompt};
Anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
I'd love to help.;
...Delicate little flower?;
No, thanks.${prompt};
Hmph!;
With that attitude, I'd be surprise-wised if you die ever having known the touch of a ${choice-player-gender}[woman/man].${prompt};
So, have you finally caved in and decided to eradicataru those shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt};
Thanks for letting me know you're a misogynistaru.${choice-player-gender}[/ It must be such a burden to loathe your own kind.]${prompt};
Not scared of combat in the least, are you? Well, that's precisely the quality I'm looking for in my surrogataru.${prompt};
I give you permission to go completely berserk-werk over any opponent you find, so don't disappoint me.${prompt};
How does it feel to be the grim reaper-weaper of shadows in the Eldieme Necropolis?${prompt};
Don't be such a frrraidy cat, Toto. Come on, let's just go!${prompt};
When I say “No,” I explicitaruly mean no!${prompt};
Would a polite appeal from me, in addition to Fhelm, change your mind?${prompt};
Neither of you actually care about me. Ever since you began working as Records of Eminence guides, all you can think-wink about is how to make more gil!${prompt};
I can't completely deny that, because I do apprrreciate me some gil.${prompt};
How can you be so egocentric as to suppose that we spurned your company solely for the sake of profit? The real reason is that--${prompt};
Put a sock in it, Rrrolandienne!${prompt};
I apologize. I simply got carried away in the moment...${prompt};
Ah...;
H-hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
What's going on?;
Oooh, I love cat fights!${prompt};
I'm sorry you had to witness that unsavory-wavory display. It's just that...${prompt};
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to play along with your japes today. To spare me the embarrassmentaru of you guessing what happened, let me tell you instead.${prompt};
These two just got done entreataruing me to help with an objective.${prompt};
That's the crrrux of the matter, at least.${prompt};
We believe that it is a tad difficult for us to carry out on our own, so we came to discuss the issue with Nantoto.${prompt};
But I'm not interested in rewards or spoils at all!;
And that's why you came to me... You knew you'd get half the pie for a third of the effortaru!${prompt};
Those catty rrremarks of yours couldn't be further from the truth. We're not trying to take advantage of you one bit.${prompt};
At any rate, we shall return when you are in a less ill humor.${prompt};
Cheerrrio, Toto!${prompt};
Haaah... I'm so drain-wained.${prompt};
At least I know you're not pretending-wending to be my friend to wring gil out of me, ${name-player}. I knew from the start you only cared about the reward.${prompt};
Yet I can't faultaru your work ethic. You've performed far better than I assumed you would.${prompt};
I have to say, though, part of me was jumping-wumping at the prospect of adventuring with my friends again.${prompt};
On the other hand, I no longer understand what motivatarus adventurers.${prompt};
I'd always assumed it was to appreciataru being with one's friends, but...${prompt};
What do you think? Is there a specific reason-weason you became an adventurer?${prompt};
What did you want to do as an adventurer?;
${selection-lines};
Explore unknown frontiers.;
Share experiences with friends.;
Stuff and things.;
Search for shiny equipment.;
Expand my intellectual horizons.;
Combat powerful entities.;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
Well, at least you're honestaru. Straight answers can be so refreshing.${prompt};
You go “any way the wind blows,” eh?;
I envy-wenvy you. I could never bring myself to do something so radical.${prompt};
Unlike you, I...${prompt};
I simultaneously covetaru the adventurer lifestyle while withdrawing from it.${prompt};
What am I even doing...?${prompt};
Deep down, I understand that Records of Eminence, objectives, and adventuring are nothing more than impetus-wimpetuses.${prompt};
They're excuses to reach out, to make contactaru, to say, “I miss the time we spent together.”${prompt};
I just had to be stubborn-wubborn, though. If anyone here's a fool, it's definitely me.${prompt};
...And now I'm complaining to you. Some embodimentaru of adventuring ideals I turned out to be.${prompt};
Take this and leave me to wallow in my self-pity-wity already!${prompt};
Oh, to go adventuring again...${prompt};
Hey, I have an idea.;
Why not lightaru these fireworks from a place that has special meaning to you? A place that's overflowing with memories of the past.${prompt};
Then, could I ask you to share anything of significance-wificance you remember with those close to you?${prompt};
You don't have to...but if you do, I'd be in your debtaru.${prompt};
They say every adventurer has a reason for startaruing their journey. Sometimes I forget what mine was...${prompt};
${name-player}.${prompt};
I've been giving it some thoughtaru for a while now, and, well, I...${prompt};
I quitaru being an adventurer!${prompt};
Now because of that...I need to ask you a favor-wavor.${prompt};
You see, I got a little bit of Eternal Flame in me and kind of had A.M.A.N. make a special-wecial objective for me.${prompt};
They were nice enough to oblige me and post it publicly, for all to undertake, which I appreciataru.${prompt};
After mulling-wulling it over, though, I realized that I can't possibly completaru it alone.${prompt};
So, yeeeah... <Whistle>;
I'm going to need-weed you to do it for me.${prompt};
Wh-what'll you have to do?;
Well, uhhhm...just excommunicataru some Yagudo High Priests from Castle Oztroja, that's all.${prompt};
Someone so teensy-weensy as me couldn't even pull a feather off one of them, let alone baste a flock. You've been baptized by the Records of Eminence, though! You can defeataru almost anything that comes at you, so will you please help me?${prompt};
Will you help her?;
${selection-lines};
With pleasure.;
If you give a Taru a treat...${prompt};
I guess I'll just have to ask a more competentaru adventurer, then. One who won't fly the coop when faced with a challenge.${prompt};
I just knew you would!;
Now, go out and ground a few of those high flyers in the name of progress-wogress!${prompt};
Why Yagudo High Priests?${prompt};
I have my reason-weasons...${prompt};
...and that's why it had to be those theocratic thugs. I was sick of that sour-wour taste in my mouth.${prompt};
Anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
I feel for you.;
So you took it out on me?${prompt};
I can't begin to describe how elatarued you've just made me. Thank you.${prompt};
So what if I did? You got a problem-woblem with that?${prompt};
Anyway, I've discovered that in the end, adventaruing comes down to three things: strength of mind, strength of body, and the strength of fortune.${prompt};
I understand that the wheel of fate does not stop in the same place-wace for everyone...${prompt};
...but still, I can't help but feel slightarued.${prompt};
That's my honestaru opinion.${prompt};
I won't ask for your empathy-wempathy or to have the scales fall from your eyes, I just want you to comply with my dumb requestaru.${prompt};
...Not at the expense of your own life, though. I wouldn't want to have that on my conscience-wonscience. Take as many companions as you can gather and don't do anything I wouldn't...wait, then you wouldn't even undertake this objective.${prompt};
If the “Grudge” objective I gave you seems too difficultaru or dangerous, feel free to leave it for later-water.${prompt};
You must be the envy of pugilistarus the world over.${prompt};
To think that I was worried about you not coming back alive due to my exorbitantaru demands...${prompt};
How silly-willy of me.;
I should have known that it would take more than a flock of zealous friars to kill you.${prompt};
Especially with the aura of confidence you exertaru, I can never count you out of any fight.${prompt};
Well, now that you've cleared the emotional cloud-wouds that hung over my heart, I can quit in peace. Too bad I'll have to look for a new place to stay, since I can't use my Mog House any more.${prompt};
But before I go, take this as thanks for all you've done-wone.${prompt};
Toto! Toto! We're not in Xarcabard anymore!${prompt};
Wh-what are you all doing-woing here?${prompt};
There is something we simply could not wait to share with you, Nantoto.${prompt};
While I am willing to share my love with anyone at any time, this gift is more...substantial than that.${prompt};
I wanted to give you one of my teacherly hugs for motivation, but we decided on pouring our blood, sweat, and tears into getting you this instead. Enjoy!${prompt};
Why, this is...${prompt};
Go on and unrrravel it like a ball of yarn!${prompt};
But...why would you do this for a desertaru like me?${prompt};
No matter what you choose to do with your life henceforth, I have a feeling that you will end up using that to help us one way or another.${prompt};
Though my heart may swell with fraternal affection for all, it heals no one. Only you can cure the wounds of the masses. That scroll is best in your hands.${prompt};
I...I don't know what to say that won't sound tritaru...${prompt};
${color-alt: 141}Nantoto uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
Nantoto learns a new spell!;
I'm such a fool. I thought you'd given up on me, so I started actaruing like a meanie-weanie to you.${prompt};
In reality, though, <sniffle> you've had me in your heartarus all along... Waaah!${prompt};
Sorry, Toto. We would've said something to help brace you, but didn't want to spoil the element of surprrrise!${prompt};
I have to say that I expected our gift to bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes.${prompt};
It's just that...I believed you were avoiding me...so...${prompt};
I desperately wanted to tell you in advance, but Fhelm was dead set against it!${prompt};
I had no choice! You'd rrraise the fur on your back and hiss at us if we mentioned anything about a present.${prompt};
I...I'm touch-wouched. To think that I ever wanted to throw away my life as an adventurer...${prompt};
I've said so many terrible-werrible things, but...if you'd find it within yourselves to take me back...;
Of course we do! Our bonds of friendship run deeper than the Sea of Shu'Meyo!${prompt};
The next time you're at a loss for an answer, remember to look to our collective love nestled deep inside you. It'll warm your soul like no other!${prompt};
I can't thank you...<sniffle>...enough...${prompt};
You will always have a spot behind my back, Nantoto, ever since you saved me from certain death.${prompt};
I still have the image of that day freshly imprintarued on my mind. We were fighting some harebrained warriors in the Valkurm Dunes--${prompt};
Could you please use a more flattering word like “audacious” or “venturous”? Otherwise, it makes me sound doubly pathetic for almost dying at their hands.${prompt};
You managed to pry me from death's icy grip, but we still had to flee in order to fight another day.${prompt};
And I met you on the hunt, rrright? Oh, how we used to fight like cats from dusk to dawn.${prompt};
Hahaha, we sure did.;
I remember having the most heated of argumentarus with you, then crying to Isakoth and Ervok afterwards.${prompt};
Assiduity and opportunity are one's most powerful assets on the path to enlightenment. The knowledge you gain from your travels across continents will be key to unlocking the gates to uncharted territories.${prompt};
Exploration is the testimony to one's courage. Likewise, Records of Eminence objectives are testimony to mankind's inquisitiveness.${prompt};
Myriad thoughts, feelings, and recollections are scattered over this vast land. We thus calmly gather them into our arms and release them anew unto the adventuring masses. We pay the price for our meddling, but so too do we reap the rewards. We dare, therefore we are.${prompt};
I could not have said it better myself!${prompt};
The influence each of you exerts during your eminent activities may be small in and of itself.${prompt};
However, those to whom you provide succor deeply appreciate your tireless efforts.${prompt};
Moreover, you do not provide aid exclusively to single individuals. Entire organizations also place their trust in you.${prompt};
Many within the A.M.A.N. possess financial resources the average commoner could only dream of. A chance opportunity from one of these individuals could yield untold riches.${prompt};
It is therefore no stretch of the imagination to say that we are able to subsist due to the noble work ethic of adventurers like you.${prompt};
In other words...scratch A.M.A.N.'s back, and it will scratch yours.${prompt};
I could not have said it better myself!${prompt};
For example, you have also made a pilgrimage to various telepoints scattered about the four corners of Vana'diel and dispersed the darkness that enshrouded the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt};
These two objectives were both originally issued by a certain member of the San d'Orian elite.${prompt};
In contrast, the one Nantoto requested regarding an ouka ranman cannot be described as anything but an abnormality.${prompt};
That was one which I had to work behind the scenes to enact. If my memory serves me, you chose ${zone: 0[2]} as the spot in which to unleash your explosion of memories, correct?${prompt};
Heh, fear not, for only you and I know that you consider that place a sanctuary. I will not tell a soul.${prompt};
Nor will I tell anyone about the valor you displayed in defeating the Yagudo High Priests to complete “Grudge.”${prompt};
...However, I suppose Nantoto already knows that.${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
I can't adequataruly express how much I owe you for taking out those Yagudo!${prompt};
Listen, we've all decided-wided to go to ${zone: 0[2]}...${prompt};
We want to check on some reportarus concerning a humongous dragon that supposedly patrols the skies there.${prompt};
We've heard various rumors about a specific locale there where bounding insectarus gather. Hopefully we'll be able to find it.${prompt};
There's a mountain of hearsay about a flower there that floatarus in midair. I certainly want to see if it's actually real or not.${prompt};
There you are! I've been looking-wooking all over for you.${prompt};
I received a couple lettarus addressed to you.${prompt};
They all come in...uniquely colored envelope-wenvelopes and are signed “D.” What do you want to do with them?${prompt};
Open which one?;
${selection-lines};
None for the nonce.;
The white one.;
The green one.;
The silver one.;
The purple one.;
The black one.;
The blue one.;
The gold one.;
The yellow one.;
The brown one.;
The red one.;
The rainbow one.${prompt};
I wouldn't open any if I were you, either. You never know what crazy-wazy stuff people deliver these days. I'd feel bad about throwing another person's property away, though, so I'll hold onto them for safekeeping.${prompt};
Here you go. I hope it doesn't contain anything too suspectaru.${prompt};
The envelope contains a briefing for a new objective.${prompt};
Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha?;
Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!${prompt};
While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it.;
Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum.;
Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.${prompt};
Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm! ${wait-36: 1};
Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'.;
Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?${prompt};
Oh yeah, 'fore I forget.;
What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.${prompt};
Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...${prompt};
Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes.;
Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more.;
"""Good things come tah dose who wait,"" right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe.";
Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.${prompt};
Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer “daily tally.”;
It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.${prompt};
Finally, ya opens da chest.;
Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!${prompt};
Oh, dat's right!;
Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase!;
Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?${prompt};
And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy!;
But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.${prompt};
Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it.;
Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.${prompt};
Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble.;
It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.${prompt};
Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in.;
Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.${prompt};
Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.${prompt};
Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.${prompt};
I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!${prompt};
Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?${prompt};
Dese're some “special dials,” an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!${prompt};
Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese “special dials”? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.${prompt};
So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.${prompt};
'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.${prompt};

Please explain again.;
Let me think about it.${prompt};
Ah yes, Tenzen mentioned that you might be passing through.${prompt};
The ambassador set his sights on Aht Urhgan, no?${prompt};
Given that you're trying to save the world...I'll let you board for free.;
Rather magnanimous, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Boss! You can't possibly mean t' let these freeloaders go without payin' a single gil!${prompt};
Tenzen left more than enough to cover our friend here. Remember that huge fuss he made?${prompt};
Urk!;
Y'know what they say. You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't...heh heh heh.${prompt};
So give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and be done with it.${prompt};
Hey, did Chacharoon send ya? Here fo' the usual?${prompt};

Wha--wha--what!? He try raise four beasties? No good. Chacharoon become mini monster meal! Drop into full-dead this time if no careful.${prompt};
But, if all work together like house-tribe, maybe not so hard. If house-tribe look out for one another, Chacharoon no give eye water for sure.${prompt};
I don't know how you keep track of all 'em kids ya got, Su'.${prompt};
Qiqirn love little Qiqirns. Little Qiqirns make happy house.${prompt};
Yeah, but how'd'ya look out for 'em when they're all the way out there in the Far East?${prompt};
Distance no matter! Wherever Qiqirn be, Qiqirn house-tribe look out for one-another. Since forever.${prompt};
Hah! Tell that to my wife!${prompt};
Qiqirn house-tribes fight too. Fight no matter.${prompt};
Every Qiqirn share future with house-tribe. Every Qiqirn stuck in same boat.${prompt};
When Qiqirn know this, Qiqirn help one another. Gobbie too.${prompt};
Yeaaah, but kids these days, y'know what I mean?${prompt};
Remember when you was goin' on about yo' boy, Chacharoon, an' how he never listened?${prompt};
You was so mad 'cause he used up all that money he was savin' on that rearin' ground or whatever.${prompt};
Don't think I don't remember how mad you got--scared half my customers away!${prompt};
You think you can forgive yo' boy after all that?${prompt};
Of course! Chacharoon be little Susuroon!${prompt};
Susuroon help Chacharoon. Give him old brain-smarts!${prompt};
Little Susuroon look after four beasties, make good practice for when have own little Chacharoons to look after.${prompt};
Huh... Looks like you guys is gonna be alright, then. Best o' luck to ya.${prompt};
Susuroon go ahead to Mog Garden and start brain-giving Chacharoon. Chacharoon learn monster herding real quick!${prompt};
Well here ya go, ${choice-player-gender}[big guy/lady]. This is what li'l Chacharoon always gets.${prompt};
Careful wi' that now. Some o' that stuff ain't dead yet.${prompt};
Now that the family's gettin' back together, I hope you'll keep thinking of us. Remember, we've got everythin' to make yo' creature yip an' yoller, an' other junk too!${prompt};
You better take that big bag o' things over ta where ya keep yo' critters or wherever.${prompt};
Let me tell ya, if Su' an' his boy can stop goin' at each other's throats it'll be a load off my back! I don't need 'em scarin' off any more customers than they already have!${prompt};

Welcome to the Morbol Cafe!;
Oh, that hideous breath... Its poison-woison is absolutely paralyzing...${prompt};
In factaru, I love it!${prompt};
...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} is not moving.;
Erp!!!;
Not half bad!;
This one is the shop's main draw! There was a huge line just to be able to hold her.${prompt};
Look at how she's wriggling about. She's so small and cute!${prompt};
My back kind of hurts and is starting to itch, but that's the whole point. It's all part of the experience.${prompt};
You're so lucky-wucky! I tried to buy a ticket for the chance to hold Cassie, but they were all sold out...${prompt};
I guess I'll just have to learn how to summon a morbol-worbol myself.${prompt};
I wonder how you go about learning to summon-wummon a morbol... I suppose I'd need to become a Beastmaster first?${prompt};
This remarkable cafe was created as part of the Green Festival event, which was an effort to help revitalize Jeuno.${prompt};
Originally concentrated in the southern countries, it has finally made its way here after moving from place to place for many years.${prompt};
However, never in my wildest dreams did I think that people would want to cuddle with morbols... What's this world coming to!?${prompt};
What's that? You want to know if it's safe having such dangerous creatures on the loose?${prompt};
There's no need to fret. All of the morbols here have been properly trained. They're completely safe... <cough>${prompt};
Apparently, they're all the rage amongst the top Linkshells... <cough> <cough>${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Cassie smiles creepily at you.;
${color-alt: 15}Samantha smiles creepily at you.;
${color-alt: 15}Vivian is secreting a strange liquid.;
Welcome! Can I perhaps interest you in some of San d'Oria's finest specialty goods?;
Greetings, my frrriend. You are in luck, for I have some of the best Windurst specialty goods that money can buy!;
Greetings. Care to look over my quality wares straight from Bastok? You won't find a better selection anywhere.;
Welcome! I've gathered some of the finestaru goods from across the frontier for your perusal!;
Hm? Forgive me, but you'll need to come back when you have a little more experience as an adventurer and a deeper understanding of the Records of Eminence.${prompt};
Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you. I have a feeling you're just the person I've been looking for.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Greyson stares at you intently.;
Ah, my apologies. Please allow me to explain. I used to be an adventurer myself and can therefore discern your strength with a mere glance.${prompt};
By chance, have you ever heard of the A.M.A.N. Reclaimers?${prompt};
They're a group that goes around collecting various items and equipment.${prompt};
They take equipment donated to the A.M.A.N. by retired adventurers and refurbish it before passing it along to active adventurers in need.${prompt};
And yours truly is in charge of coordinating the collection of those items!${prompt};
Well, I guess you could say I'm more of an employee doing the A.M.A.N.'s bidding. Hahaha...${prompt};
So, if you bring me some ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I'll exchange them for various goods.${prompt};
You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing these Records of Eminence objectives.${prompt};
I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!${prompt};
Stop by anytime and I'll take any ${item-plural: 0[2]} that you manage to collect.${prompt};
When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.${prompt};
Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?${prompt};
From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.${prompt};
I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!${prompt};
Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.${prompt};
At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!${prompt};
You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.${prompt};
Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.${prompt};
First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.${prompt};
You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!${prompt};
In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!${prompt};
Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Greyson smiles at you gently.;
Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.${prompt};
I'm also more than happy to explain to you the intricacies of rainbow chests, belligerent bangs, and previously used orbs.${prompt};
Now, now... There's no need to be in such a hurry. Simply hear me out for a moment.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing in particular.;
Exchanging ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Purchasing ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
A.M.A.N. Trove.;
Orbs.;
Obtaining ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Rainbow chests.;
Belligerent bangs.;
Previously used orbs.;
You.${prompt};
Select an orb. (You have ${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[voucher/vouchers].);
${selection-lines};
Never mind.;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} (${number: 9} vouchers).;
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} (${number: 10} vouchers).${prompt};
Do you want to trade for the ${item-singular: 30[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but you do not have enough ${item-plural: 0[2]} to make the exchange.${prompt};
Okay, we have a deal. Keep on earning those vouchers and I'll be right here waiting for you.${prompt};
Purchase one voucher for ${number: 8} gil?;
${selection-lines};
No thanks.;
Sure, I'll take one.;
I'll buy as many as I can. (${number: 9} remaining)${prompt};
Um... I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items, there's a limit on how many vouchers can be purchased within a certain time period. You'll need to wait about one month (Earth time) before buying more.${prompt};
Purchase ${number: 9} ${choice-plurality: 9}[voucher/vouchers] for ${number: 10} gil?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
It's been a pleasure doing business with you!${prompt};
Including the ${item-plural: 0[2]} I have on hand for you, you now have a total of ${number: 1} voucher${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]. Let me know if you wish to exchange any for an orb.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. Trove is based on the use of special items such as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
So, you want to know about the difference between ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Basically, the difference comes down to the success rate of obtaining better-quality items. It's much easier to hit it big and win higher-quality items with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Furthermore, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} ensures that at least one of your items will be of a certain quality.${prompt};
Although, I imagine the definition of “quality” differs from person to person, so just think of it as a general guide.${prompt};
On a separate note, I heard a rumor when I first started that the more you bring to the A.M.A.N., the more items you'll receive.${prompt};
You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.${prompt};
And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of ${number: 8} vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.${prompt};
Among the wooden coffers you come across, a small fraction of them will be shimmering with a prismatic light.${prompt};
These “rainbow chests“ are sometimes present right from the outset, and they always contain a highly-sought-after reward inside.${prompt};
Some who have ventured into the trove have reported that if they open eight wooden chests--meaning that the only one left contains a mimic--the remaining chest will be overcome with the selfsame rainbow glow.${prompt};
Of course, I cannot even begin to fathom how lucky one would have to be for that to actually be the case. Perhaps it's but a rumor.${prompt};
Ah, yes. The good old belligerent bangs.${prompt};
The sound that the treasure chest makes when you eagerly open it, flinging the lid open and slamming it onto the back of the chest, has some correlation with whether or not the chest's reward is great, or merely “good.”${prompt};
Particularly astute adventurers will also note that opening a chest can provide a clue as to whether or not any of the remaining chests have particularly valuable rewards.${prompt};
However, it takes a few treasure chests to be able to properly triangulate your internal sensing systems. Opening three should be sufficient.${prompt};
If I could meet whomever or whatever was in charge of crafting these orbs, I would be inclined to give them a good smacking.${prompt};
But let's keep that between us, hm?${prompt};
Would you happen to be in possession of any used A.M.A.N. Trove orbs?${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. believes that littering the ground with used trinkets harms the beauty of the landscape, so we are happy to provide you with proper compensation should you trade me used orbs instead of discarding them.${prompt};
Who knows? If I'm feeling particularly generous that day, you may get a fresh orb for your troubles.${prompt};
Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.${prompt};
I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.${prompt};
However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.${prompt};
I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.${prompt};
I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.${prompt};
When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.${prompt};
To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...${prompt};
However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.${prompt};
Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.${prompt};
Of course, I'm happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I'd appreciate it if you could buy some ${item-plural: 0[2]} from me as well!${prompt};
I have received a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you so far. Let me know if you wish to trade some of them for an orb.${prompt};
Um... I'm sorry, but you can't carry any more. Would you like to exchange some for an orb or two?${prompt};
This one has already been used. Perhaps I can offer you a free one to satiate your lust for treasures.;
Here you are--a freshly charged ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This one has already been used. I'll give you a freebie, okay?;
Here. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, this one hasn't been used yet. Nothing I can do with it.${prompt};
Hm? What's that?;
You're lookin' for's some girl, are ya?${prompt};
Ah, I know the girl yer talkin' about!;
The one who's here for the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt};
The festival's a very important event for us Goblins.;
It's been around fer ages now.${prompt};
It's held whenever we Goblins are in danger or the world itself has lost all hope...${prompt};
The festival helps bring us a sense of calm when we feel like prayin' is our only remainin' option.${prompt};
The last time it was held was over several hundred years ago...;
They say there was a battle 'tween the gods of light and darkness.${prompt};
Of course, the reason we're holdin' it again now goes without sayin'.;
Countless “World Eater Eggs” are being found across the land.${prompt};
Yes, I've heard all about you as well.${prompt};
Ya saved our Goblin heroes from certain death on Zepwell Island, yes?${prompt};
Even though you're no beastie, ya know just how terrifyin' a “World Eater Egg” from Chaos truly is.${prompt};
Therefore, you can understand the fear, anxiety, and general unease that we Goblins are feelin', right?${prompt};
In fact, it terrifies us beasties so much that many aren't even able to work.;
That's why we need to have this festival--to calm everyone's nerves.${prompt};
Hm? You wanna know how this girl yer lookin' for's involved with the festival?${prompt};
The Festival of Brave Souls is always a sad affair, so I thought it'd be good to prepare somethin' a bit more lighthearted.;
Ya know, to keep up wit' the times and all.${prompt};
So I put out a call for a skilled entertainer and that girl showed up.${prompt};
However, she was much weaker than I expected...${prompt};
So I sent her over to Maat in order to really push her to her limits and get her ready in time fer the festival.${prompt};
Huh? She forgot somethin' while she was there?;
And now you're tryin' to give it back to her?${prompt};
I see...;
In that case, I suppose it's okay if I tell you her whereabouts...${prompt};
According to her, she's always bein' hounded by her many throngs of fans.;
So she asked that I keep her location a secret.${prompt};
Although, we've had to shelve our plans to have her perform at the festival.;
I doubt there'll be much to see, let alone any of her fans.${prompt};
Here, I'll draw up a map for ya.;
Simply show it to the Tarutaru soldier in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.${prompt};
His name is Miladi-Nildi.;
He can show you where she's stayin'.${prompt};
As long as that shadow looms large, we can't have the festival.;
Is there anything that can be done...${prompt};
Show that map I drew ya to the soldier standin' in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.;
His name is Miladi-Nildi.${prompt};
He can show ya how to find the girl yer lookin' for.${prompt};
Oh, this is a rare sightaru indeed. That's a map from a Goblin you're carrying.;
Very well, I can show you the way.${prompt};
Hello! Do you come bearing yet more gifts from my legions of adoring fans?;
You can just set them down over there.${prompt};
How will you respond?;
${selection-lines};
You forgot this!;
I'm a huge fan!;
Firesday Night Fever!${prompt};
Huh!? I-it can't be!${prompt};
Wh-where did you find this!?${prompt};
So ${name-player}, you heard everything, did you...${prompt};
I was hoping to seek out new challenges and take my idol career to the next level.${prompt};
You see, I wanted to form a dance duo with a Goblin girl so that we could display our talents on a worldwide stage.${prompt};
Uka felt that the image of the Mighty Maidens would suffer as a result, but I'm more worried about my act growing stale.${prompt};
I mean, I know I'm wildly popular with my fans and audiences everywhere, but I'm constantly doing the same show over and over again!${prompt};
They're waiting with bated breath for me to come out with a great new costume and even more songs and dance routines!;
You know, something real spectacular!${prompt};
It was then that things took a sudden turn...${prompt};
I heard the Goblins were planning some kind of festival.${prompt};
When you think of festivals, what comes to mind? That's right! The performances!;
And what better performance is there than the Heroine Stage Show?${prompt};
Somehow, the Goblins felt that my show lacked the proper punch.;
However, I know my fans would've given me the strength to put on a powerful performance.${prompt};
So I started thinking up some new poses and catchphrases.;
I worked really hard on them too...${prompt};
Even so, that Maat guy kept complaining about me though.;
He basically told me I was a failure as an idol!${prompt};
It caused me to lose some of my usual superstar swagger.${prompt};
Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt};
...;
No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt};
Ah, there you are, Mumor. I come bearing news.${prompt};
Huh!?;
This isn't good!;
This isn't good at all, kupo!${prompt};
What's wrong, Diva...err, I mean Kupolietta!?${prompt};
I was told that we might not be able to perform at the Festival of Brave Souls, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, what!?;
Why not!?${prompt};
It's all because of that rumor...;
That terrible rumor, kupo.${prompt};
They say an ominous shadow wanders to the east of Batallia Downs each and every night...;
Apparently, everyone who sees it says the same thing, kupo...;
“I saw something that nobody should ever have to see...”;
They then leave Jeuno, never to return again...;
Th-this is terrible news!;
Isn't the Festival of Brave Souls also held east of Batallia Downs!?${prompt};
Indeed it is, kupo.;
The cave there is the very heart of the festivities.${prompt};
Yet, as long as that shadow roams about, there's no way they can have the festival, kupo.${prompt};
Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt};
...;
No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt};
And so, the brave Mumor found that she must rise up to strike down this shadowy threat!${prompt};
Yes, that's right!;
I must take my destiny into my own hands!${prompt};
Although, as it stands, I'm just a lone idol.;
I'll never be able to muster the necessary strength for this task.${prompt};
So that's where you come in.;
This is your chance to join me as a Mighty Maiden!${prompt};
I mean, you're an adventurer, right?;
Come on, together, we'll form an unstoppable duo!${prompt};
Form a duo with Mumor?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, why not.;
I think I'll pass.;
I'm not really a maiden...${prompt};
Thank you so much!;
It's settled then! We'll be known as the Dashing Damsels!${prompt};
What's that?;
Speak up, I can't hear you.${prompt};
Hooray!;
We're going to be the best duo ever!${prompt};
Come on--deep down, everyone has something of a girlish side.${prompt};
From today forth, we shall be known as the Delightful Damsels!${prompt};
There's nothing like the sweet feelings of love that come from a warm and caring heart.${prompt};
We'll show that sinister shadow what for!;
Come, we march for Batallia Downs at once!${prompt};
Hm? You're wondering if I know aboutaru the mysterious shadow that wanders Batallia Downs after dark?${prompt};
Of course I do!;
You'd be smartaru to stay away from the cave in eastern Batallia Downs--the one within view of the ocean.${prompt};
But, if you think you have what it takes to stand againstaru this shadow, I won't try to stop you.${prompt};
Are ya here 'bout the Festival of Brave Souls too?${prompt};
Oh well, I guess it can't be helped.;
The most important site for the festival is a cave east of Batallia Downs.${prompt};
Five thousand years ago, many brave warriors lost their lives.;
That location is currently servin' as their burial mound.${prompt};
But there's a mysterious shadow prowlin' their eternal resting place.;
Unfortunately, it's keepin' us from going anywhere near it.${prompt};
Unbelievable!;
Why am I just hearing about this now!?${prompt};
I understand your frustration, but this story was written for us by a famous Goblin author.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}!;
I'm glad you're here!${prompt};
You know my show that was scheduled for the Festival of Brave Souls?${prompt};
Get this, they're calling it the “Mighty Maiden Fantastox Heroine Stage Show”!${prompt};
First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?;
My name is Mumor!${prompt};
Fantastox's a famous Goblin thief.;
Her specialties include Sneak Attacks and Trick Attacks.${prompt};
So I'm supposed to team up with this thief against the enemy, right!?${prompt};
Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt};
Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?;
That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt};
In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt};
And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?;
Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt};
I know, right?;
We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt};
I get it!;
So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt};
Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...;
But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt};
Wait, what!?;
You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt};
Yeah, that's the point.;
I've been tellin' ya that from the very beginning.${prompt};Oui, c'est ça.
Hey, it's ${name-player}!;Je vous le dis depuis le tout début.${prompt}
What are you doing here!?${prompt};Hé, c'est ${name-player} !
Ah! It's the brave hero, Gloom Phantom!${prompt};Que fais-tu ici !?${prompt}
Brave hero...?${prompt};Ah ! C'est le brave héros, Gloom Phantom !${prompt}
I came as soon as I received your message!${prompt};Brave héros... ?${prompt}
So the “World Eater Egg” was found right in the middle of Jeuno!${prompt};Je suis venu dès que j'ai reçu votre message !${prompt}
That's right.;Donc l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » a été trouvé en plein cœur de Jeuno !${prompt}
Before anyone realized it was the “World Eater Egg,” it went from being in a Goblin's capable hands to someone eating it...${prompt};C'est exact.
Wha!? The shell was cracked open without needing my sword!?${prompt};Avant que quiconque ne réalise qu'il s'agissait de l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes », il est passé des mains capables d'un gobelin à quelqu'un qui l'a mangé...${prompt}
Yeah, it's a total mystery.;Quoi !? La coquille s'est cassée sans avoir besoin de mon épée !?${prompt}
It's also unclear where this “World Eater Egg” originally came from.${prompt};Oui, c'est un véritable mystère.
The World Eater...Egg...?${prompt};On ne sait pas non plus d'où venait cet « Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » à l'origine.${prompt}
Ultimately, it was that girl there who gave the egg to the man known as Maat, who then promptly ate it.${prompt};L'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes... ?${prompt}
W-well, I, uh...;Au final, c'est cette fille là-bas qui a donné l'œuf à l'homme connu sous le nom de Maat, qui l'a ensuite mangé sans plus tarder.${prompt}
He told me he was hungry, and so I simply brought him ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I found nearby...${prompt};Euh... eh bien, je...
What I want to know is where was the egg before that?${prompt};Il m'a dit qu'il avait faim, alors j'ai simplement apporté ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} que j'ai trouvé à proximité...${prompt}
I don't know the details, but I heard a monster near Delkfutt's Tower was carryin' it.${prompt};Ce que je veux savoir, c'est où était l'œuf avant cela ?${prompt}
Delkfutt?;Je ne connais pas les détails, mais j'ai entendu qu'un monstre près de la Tour de Delkfutt le transportait.${prompt}
Where have I heard that name before...${prompt};Delkfutt ?
Delkfutt's Tower is on Qufim Island, which is in Gigas territory.;Où ai-je déjà entendu ce nom...${prompt}
Clearly, certain death awaits us there.${prompt};La Tour de Delkfutt se trouve sur l'île de Qufim, qui est sur le territoire des Gigas.
Can I ask for your help in this matter, brave hero?${prompt};Il est clair que la mort certaine nous attend là-bas.${prompt}
That's why I'm here!;Puis-je demander votre aide dans cette affaire, brave héros ?${prompt}
Leave everything to us!${prompt};C'est pourquoi je suis là !
Hmm... Maybe one of the Gigas knows about the egg and the monster that had it...${prompt};Laissez tout nous à nous !${prompt}
I got it!;Hmm... Peut-être qu'un des Gigas sait quelque chose sur l'œuf et le monstre qui l'avait...${prompt}
We'll go to Qufim Island and capture one of the Gigas there and question it!${prompt};J'ai compris !
You can help us too, ${name-player}!${prompt};Nous irons sur l'île de Qufim et capturerons l'un des Gigas là-bas pour l'interroger !${prompt}
Will you help?;Vous pouvez aussi nous aider, ${name-player} !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allez-vous nous aider ?
Sure, count me in!;
Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt};Bien sûr, comptez sur moi !
Naturally, Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island as well!${prompt};Désolé, je suis occupé.${prompt}
Where's your sense of adventure!?${prompt};Bien sûr, Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim !${prompt}
Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island too, so there's no need to be afraid!${prompt};Où est passée votre soif d'aventure !?${prompt}
Okay, we'll be waiting for you in front of Delkfutt's Tower!${prompt};Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim, alors pas besoin d'avoir peur !${prompt}
It's rare that you meet such a mighty hero in person.;D'accord, nous vous attendrons devant la Tour de Delkfutt !${prompt}
There aren't many who can draw others to their cause so effortlessly.${prompt};C'est rare de rencontrer un tel héros puissant en personne.
As for you...;Il n'y en a pas beaucoup qui peuvent attirer les autres à leur cause aussi facilement.${prompt}
"I believe people called ya ""that horror from the holdfast"" before, yes?${prompt}";Quant à vous...
So clearly, that makes ya the perfect villain for our story.${prompt};"Je crois que les gens vous appelaient ""cette horreur de la tour"" auparavant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}"
I resent that remark!;Donc clairement, cela fait de vous le parfait méchant pour notre histoire.${prompt}
You obviously don't know what's important in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt};Je prends cela comme une insulte !
Wh-what did you say!?${prompt};Vous ne savez évidemment pas ce qui est important dans un spectacle de l'héroïne !${prompt}
If you don't know how a show is supposed to resonate with its fans, then I guess I'll just have to teach you!${prompt};Q-quoi avez-vous dit !?${prompt}
Phew! That was intense.${prompt};Si vous ne savez pas comment un spectacle est censé résonner avec ses fans, alors je suppose que je vais juste devoir vous enseigner !${prompt}
She said she's goin' back home to grab an old script or somethin' like that.${prompt};Ouf ! C'était intense.${prompt}
I think I'd better take this chance to get as far away from here as possible...${prompt};Elle a dit qu'elle rentrerait chez elle chercher un vieux script ou quelque chose comme ça.${prompt}
As for you, you need to go help Gloom Phantom at Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.;Je crois qu'il vaudrait mieux que je saisisse cette chance pour m'éloigner d'ici le plus loin possible...${prompt}
Got it?${prompt};En ce qui vous concerne, vous devez aller aider Gloom Phantom à la Tour de Delkfutt sur l'île de Qufim.
So anyway, that Gigas known as Echion knew some things, but not others.${prompt};Vous avez compris ?${prompt}
I see...;Quoi qu'il en soit, ce Gigas nommé Echion connaissait certaines choses, mais pas d'autres.${prompt}
Although, we still don't know how the “World Eater Egg” was cracked open without using your sword.${prompt};Je vois...
Indeed. Not even the undead themselves should be able to break it open.${prompt};Bien que, nous ne savons toujours pas comment l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” a été ouvert sans utiliser ton épée.${prompt}
However, they do seem to have the ability to find the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt};En effet. Même les morts-vivants eux-mêmes ne devraient pas pouvoir l'ouvrir.${prompt}
Still, I'm amazed by the Gigas's stupidity.;Cependant, ils semblent avoir la capacité de trouver l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes”.${prompt}
This all happened because they found the “World Eater Egg” and just let it be.${prompt};Néanmoins, je suis stupéfait par la stupidité des Gigas.
They just ignore whatever we have to say!${prompt};Tout cela est arrivé parce qu'ils ont trouvé l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” et l'ont laissé tranquille.${prompt}
Furthermore, they have no idea just how terrifying Chaos truly is!${prompt};Ils ignorent simplement tout ce que nous avons à dire !${prompt}
Five thousand years ago, the one known as Chaos sought to destroy all that was new, even the world itself...${prompt};De plus, ils ne se rendent pas compte à quel point Chaos est vraiment terrifiant !${prompt}
That included Goblins, Yagudo, Orcs, Quadav...;Il y a cinq mille ans, celui connu sous le nom de Chaos cherchait à détruire tout ce qui était nouveau, même le monde lui-même...${prompt}
Anything that was different from itself.;Cela incluait les Gobelins, les Yagudo, les Orcs, les Quadav...
A great number of species went extinct before the strongest of those that remained banded together.;Tout ce qui était différent de lui-même.
The Gigas feel that way because during the battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, they hadn't even been born yet.${prompt};Un grand nombre d'espèces se sont éteintes avant que les plus forts de ceux qui restaient ne se rassemblent.
So there's no way they could've known about the hatred from those that were devoured by Chaos.${prompt};Les Gigas se sentent ainsi parce que lors de la bataille contre Chaos il y a cinq mille ans, ils n'étaient même pas encore nés.${prompt}
Well, I don't like how they don't believe us just because they haven't seen something themselves.${prompt};Donc, il est impossible qu'ils aient pu connaître la haine de ceux qui ont été dévorés par Chaos.${prompt}
By the way, about that undead who was carrying the World Eater Egg...${prompt};Eh bien, je n'aime pas qu'ils ne nous croient pas juste parce qu'ils n'ont pas vu quelque chose eux-mêmes.${prompt}
Is the mage known as Garazu-Horeizu that can control the undead involved somehow?${prompt};Au fait, à propos de ce mort-vivant qui transportait l'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes...${prompt}
Actually, we don't really know the answer to that ourselves.${prompt};Le mage connu sous le nom de Garazu-Horeizu qui peut contrôler les morts-vivants est-il impliqué d'une manière ou d'une autre ?${prompt}
Well, someone must know something!${prompt};En fait, nous ne connaissons pas vraiment la réponse à cela nous-mêmes.${prompt}
M-maybe this one here knows s-something?${prompt};Eh bien, quelqu'un doit bien savoir quelque chose !${prompt}
How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?;P-peut-être que celui-ci sait q-quelque chose ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
The book on maelstrom theory...?;
The Fourth Yagudo War...?;Le livre sur la théorie des tourbillons... ?
Sorry, I forgot.${prompt};La Quatrième Guerre Yagudo... ?
What do you mean you forgot!?;Désolé, j'ai oublié.${prompt}
I'm gonna yank your petals out myself!${prompt};Comment ça, tu as oublié !?
How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?;Je vais t'arracher tes pétales moi-même !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
Like the maelstrom theory?;
How about the Yagudo War?;Comme la théorie du tourbillon ?
Was it the “new discoveries”?${prompt};Que dirais-tu de la Guerre Yagudo ?
Hmm... I'm not sure if that makes it any clearer or not.${prompt};Était-ce les “découvertes nouvelles” ?${prompt}
I think I got a pretty good idea.;Hmm... Je ne suis pas sûr si ça rend les choses plus claires ou non.${prompt}
We can have Dazbog explain the rest later.${prompt};Je pense que j'ai une assez bonne idée.
Th-that's fine, but we still haven't solved the m-mystery yet...${prompt};On peut demander à Dazbog d'expliquer le reste plus tard.${prompt}
We haven't!?${prompt};C-c'est bien, mais nous n'avons toujours pas résolu le mystère...${prompt}
C-clearly, Garazu-Horeizu wanted info on Chaos in order to l-learn a new kind of magic.${prompt};Nous ne l'avons pas !?${prompt}
H-he looked into Chaos even after his death and journey to V-Valhalla...${prompt};C-clairement, Garazu-Horeizu voulait des informations sur Chaos afin d'apprendre un nouveau type de magie.${prompt}
B-but Chaos was defeated in Valhalla...${prompt};I-il a enquêté sur Chaos même après sa mort et son voyage à V-Valhalla...${prompt}
Yeah, that's right!;M-mais Chaos a été vaincu à Valhalla...${prompt}
Odin dealt the finishing blow personally!${prompt};Oui, c'est vrai !
Wait, I thought it was a brave Goblin hero that delivered that blow five thousand years ago?${prompt};Odin a porté le coup final en personne !${prompt}
Huh? In the battle for the Middle Lands, it was my ancestor who dealt the finishing blow.${prompt};Attends, je croyais que c'était un brave héros gobelin qui avait porté ce coup il y a cinq mille ans ?${prompt}
However, Chaos was no ordinary opponent.${prompt};Hein ? Dans la bataille pour les Terres du Milieu, c'est mon ancêtre qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
Chaos was resurrected in a world beyond this one...${prompt};Cependant, Chaos n'était pas un adversaire ordinaire.${prompt}
So my ancestor and numerous other brave warriors journeyed to Valhalla and continued the fight, even beyond death.${prompt};Chaos a été ressuscité dans un monde au-delà de celui-ci...${prompt}
Ah, so those are the warriors whose death we mourn as part of the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt};Ainsi, mon ancêtre et de nombreux autres vaillants guerriers ont voyagé jusqu'à Valhalla et ont poursuivi le combat, même après la mort.${prompt}
So at the very end, Odin dealt the final blow.${prompt};Ah, ce sont donc les guerriers dont nous pleurons la mort dans le cadre du Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
Hmm... So clearly, Chaos met its end long, long ago.${prompt};Ainsi, à la toute fin, c'est Odin qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
That's a relief.;Hmm... Donc clairement, Chaos a trouvé sa fin il y a bien longtemps.${prompt}
I was worried about what I'd do if Chaos was still alive today.${prompt};C'est un soulagement.
It's not just me, either. All Goblins carry this sense of dread.;J'étais inquiet de ce que je ferais si Chaos était encore en vie aujourd'hui.${prompt}
That's why we started the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt};Ce n'est pas juste moi non plus. Tous les gobelins ressentent cette crainte.
I wholeheartedly support this festival as well!${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous avons commencé le Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
I've got it!;Je soutiens entièrement ce festival aussi !${prompt}
We can call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Remember the Battle against Chaos”!${prompt};Je l'ai !
Say that again?${prompt};On peut l'appeler le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Souvenez-vous de la Bataille contre Chaos” !${prompt}
It's a show we can put on at the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt};Répète ça ?${prompt}
Or, we can simplify the name a bit and just call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Defeat Chaos”!${prompt};C'est un spectacle que nous pouvons présenter lors du Festival des Braves Âmes !${prompt}
What is she talking about!?${prompt};Ou, nous pouvons simplifier un peu le nom et l’appeler simplement le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Vaincre Chaos” !${prompt}
She's not happy with the show for the festival, so she's been trying to convince me to change it.${prompt};De quoi elle parle !?${prompt}
You're right...;Elle n'est pas satisfaite du spectacle pour le festival, donc elle essaie de me convaincre de le changer.${prompt}
She's been here the whole time.${prompt};Tu as raison...
It came to me after hearing all of you talk!${prompt};Elle est là depuis le début.${prompt}
This evil being known as Chaos tried to eradicate anyone who was different from it, so various beings worked together to oppose it, right?${prompt};Cela m'est venu après vous avoir tous entendus parler !${prompt}
And afterwards, this enemy rose up once again to put the land in danger!;Cet être maléfique connu sous le nom de Chaos a essayé d'éradiquer quiconque était différent de lui, donc diverses créatures ont travaillé ensemble pour s'y opposer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
This story has it all--a real tearjerker followed by everyone living happily ever after!${prompt};Et ensuite, cet ennemi s'est levé de nouveau pour mettre la terre en danger !
A story like that contains everything that fans want to see in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt};Cette histoire a tout ce qu'il faut - de vraies larmes, suivies de tout le monde vivant heureux pour toujours !${prompt}
First: everyone is made stronger due to their differences!${prompt};Une histoire comme celle-là contient tout ce que les fans veulent voir dans un spectacle de scène héroïque !${prompt}
Second: they overcome their differences and work together!${prompt};Premièrement: tout le monde devient plus fort grâce à leurs différences !${prompt}
Third: there are moments of sadness, but people rise up in a spirit of hope!${prompt};Deuxièmement: ils surmontent leurs différences et travaillent ensemble !${prompt}
Hmm... When you put it like that...${prompt};Troisièmement: il y a des moments de tristesse, mais les gens se relèvent dans un esprit d’espoir !${prompt}
Furthermore, once everyone sees the show, they won't be like the Gigas and not believe in something because they've never seen it before!${prompt};Hmm... Quand on le dit comme ça...${prompt}
Yes, I suppose you have a point...${prompt};De plus, une fois que tout le monde aura vu le spectacle, ils ne seront pas comme les Gigas et ne croiront pas en quelque chose parce qu'ils ne l'ont jamais vu auparavant !${prompt}
Okay! I'll give it some thought!${prompt};Oui, je suppose que tu as raison...${prompt}
You will!?${prompt};D'accord ! J'y réfléchirai sérieusement !${prompt}
However, in regards to Valhalla...${prompt};Vraiment !?${prompt}
Chaos may have hidden the egg before its death.${prompt};Cependant, en ce qui concerne Valhalla...${prompt}
Yes, that's totally possible!;Le Chaos a peut-être caché l'œuf avant sa mort.${prompt}
However, I think Odin would've noticed...${prompt};Oui, c'est totalement possible !
Maybe his nose was stuffed up, or he had something else on his mind at the time.${prompt};Cependant, je pense qu'Odin aurait remarqué...${prompt}
I-it's definitely a mystery...;Peut-être que son nez était bouché, ou qu'il avait autre chose en tête à ce moment-là.${prompt}
I wish I could ask Odin p-personally.${prompt};C'est vraiment un mystère...
Wha!? You realize that means you'd have to be dead, right!?${prompt};J'aimerais pouvoir demander à Odin personnellement.${prompt}
Of course I don't want to die, but I don't want to go back to Hazhalm either!${prompt};Quoi !? Tu réalises que cela signifie que tu devrais être morte, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
I-in that case, we could always ask one of Odin's demons...${prompt};Bien sûr que je ne veux pas mourir, mais je ne veux pas non plus retourner à Hazhalm !${prompt}
Oh! You're right! That's a great idea!${prompt};D-dans ce cas, on pourrait toujours demander à l'un des démons d'Odin...${prompt}
Is there one that we can easily talk to?${prompt};Oh ! Tu as raison ! C'est une excellente idée !${prompt}
There are a few like that here in Jeuno.;Y en a-t-il un avec qui nous pouvons facilement parler ?${prompt}
They're disguised as regular people.${prompt};Il y en a quelques-uns ici à Jeuno.
Okay then! Let's get going!${prompt};Ils se déguisent en personnes ordinaires.${prompt}
After hearing that girl's excitement, I've decided to give her proposal some serious thought.${prompt};D'accord alors ! Allons-y !${prompt}
With a show based on the battle against Chaos, we can reach people that might not know anything about it.${prompt};Après avoir entendu l'enthousiasme de cette fille, j'ai décidé de prendre sérieusement en considération sa proposition.${prompt}
The problem is what role can I have her play...;Avec un spectacle basé sur la bataille contre le Chaos, nous pouvons toucher des gens qui pourraient ne rien savoir à ce sujet.${prompt}
Hmm... What if she played Chaos...?${prompt};Le problème est quel rôle je peux lui faire jouer...
