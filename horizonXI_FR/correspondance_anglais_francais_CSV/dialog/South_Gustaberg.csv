I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt};
After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt};
A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--;
Kupopo!?${prompt};
The moogle appears to have received a message...!;
G-grave news, kupo!!!;
Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt};
Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt};
Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!;
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt};
We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt};
To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
When you plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!${prompt};
Alright then!;
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!${prompt};
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!;
Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt};
A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt};
Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt};
But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! Great!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt};
The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! I like your enthusiasm!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have in your possession, kupo!${prompt};
Nooo, that ${item-singular: 0[2]} won't do.;
Come back again after you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo!;
You've absorbed ${choice: 0}[a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!${prompt};
Thanks, kupo.;
We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!${prompt};

I've been a sailor for over forty years, yet I cannot grasp the concept of the world as a whole. Then again, those who live in cities know even less than I.${prompt};
They are content knowing only of the things around them. I cannot blame them for choosing to live this way, as curiosity is, more often than not, a dangerous trait.${prompt};

Don't think you can do your scooping just anywhere, though. Look for the fireworks displays.;
After you're done scooping, bring the fish to me! You think you can handle that!?${prompt};
Why, goldfish, of course! What else would you scoop!?;
There are three known kinds! Can you count that high!? One, two, three!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are quick and tiny. Any sissy with a scoop can grab one. You're lucky that I even give you a point for each one you bring.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} are black and heavy. I'll give you two points for one, but only because I'm a nice guy!${prompt};
Finally, ${item-plural: 2[2]} are big and mean...like me! So if your puny scoop survives the ordeal, I'll give you ten points for one!${prompt};
Consider yourself lucky that I'm even telling you this, but there may be other kinds lurking about as well. If you can catch any of them, I'll consider giving you bonus points!${prompt};
What!? You're asking me how a goldfish can survive in hot springs like these? How am I supposed to know!? Do I look like a goldfish scientist to you!?${prompt};
Why should you scoop!?;
Why shouldn't you scoop?;
Just look at all the junk you can get from scooping!${prompt};
${number: 0} points will buy you another ${item-singular: 1[2]}. “Keep the scooping alive,” that's my motto!${prompt};
Or you can trade ${number: 0} points for a bag of fireworks. Don't even ask me what kind of firework is in the bag, though...'cause I don't know!${prompt};
Fork over ${number: 0} points and I'll give you some fans to cool off. You do look kind of sweaty, even for an adventurer!${prompt};
${number: 0} points will get you a sweet colored drop! I was raised on those things, and just look how I turned out!${prompt};
${number: 0} points can be exchanged for what's in the mystery box!;
What is in the mystery box? Well, it wouldn't be much of a mystery if I told you now, would it!?${prompt};
Remember, you have to earn points if you want the prizes, and you have to scoop goldfish if you want points!${prompt};
And that's all I'm telling you! Figure out the rest on your own!${prompt};
Finally come to your senses, eh!? Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. And don't lose it, loser!${prompt};

Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
And that's not all!;
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};
Well done!;
On to the next one, kupo!${prompt};
That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt};
Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!;
If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt};
Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt};
The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt};

Kupo-whoa-whoa there, pardner!;
Care to saddle up and help us rustle up a couple o' wild buffalo?;
'Cause we've got a stampede on our hands, I reckon!${prompt};
Lend a hand?;
${selection-lines};
<Skedaddle away.>;
A stampede, you say?;
I reckon I will.${prompt};
Well, sit down and grab a sarsaparilla, and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.;
You see, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) ain't too popular among the townsfolk these days, and they've been talkin' with their wallets by not sendin' too many gold nuggets our way, if you catch my drift.${prompt};
But seein' as how we moogles are an enterprisin' bunch, we done hatched ourselves a plan, y'hear?${prompt};
A plan we call... The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch! Yeeeeee-hawww!!!${prompt};
Rustle up a herd of the most darn-tootin' fearsome buffalo from over and yonder, throw a fence around 'em, and you done got yerself the rip-roarin'est dude ranch this side of the Rio Rafeloux, kupo!${prompt};
Set up a saloon on the side serving scrumptious buffalo burgers, and you've got contented customers filling our moogle coffers with mucho dinero... Comprende?${prompt};
That there was the plan, pardner.${prompt};
So we lassoed up a herd o' ill-tempered buffalo from the mountains up north, and were leadin' our li'l dogies back this-a-way to town...${prompt};
And that's when we hit a bit o' a snag.${prompt};
Dagnabbit if I know where they came from, but a swarm of confounded chigoes done showed up!${prompt};
Now y'see, these buffalo come from the mountains, and ain't never seen the likes of no chigoes before.;
They raised a right ruckus, and next thing y'know, we done had a stampede on our hands!${prompt};
Y'ever see a stampedin' buffalo?;
Even our moogle hypnosis did 'bout as much good as a poke in the ear with a rusty cattle prod, kupo!${prompt};
That's where you come in, pardner.;
What say you saddle up and help us moogles round up these beasties?${prompt};
For each buffalo you capture, we'll give you one o' these here “bovine brands.”;
Collect 'em and mount 'em and you'll be eligible to win a veritable bonanza o' special prizes!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks at you with puppy-dog eyes...;
Now, I'd do this myself and save y'all the trouble, but jus' look at me...;
One kick from a stampedin' buffalo and my puny moogle body'd be flung right to the other side o' Vana'diel, I reckon!${prompt};
Y'all got nothin' to worry 'bout, though.;
As big and sturdy as you are, I reckon you'd only fly to just over yonder a-ways.${prompt};
And as an added bonus, you can trade the bovine brands you've earned for a whole kit 'n caboodle o' Buffalo Bonanza Ranch goods and prizes! Yeeeeee-haw, kupo!${prompt};
So how's about it, pardner?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} gazes at ${name-player} with a steely glint in his eye.;
Saddle up?;
${selection-lines};
I think I'll pass.;
Sure. Yeee-haw!${prompt};
Yippie ki-yi-yay!!!;
Much obliged, pardner!${prompt};
If your cow-herdin' skills are up to the task, we'll stamp you some “bovine brands” on this here sheet.${prompt};
Once you've racked up your share o' brands, just mosey back on over here to claim your prizes!${prompt};
So sharpen your spurs, and when you're ready, herd up the buffalo and lead them to the moogle cowhand in area ${choice: 3}[G-9/I-8/G-9/H-9/H-6/I-7], kupo!${prompt};
Ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more about the buffalo.;
How about some help, pardner?;
Giddy-up!${prompt};
All right, now go rustle yerself up some buffalo! Yee-haw!${prompt};
The big beastly ones are the bulls, the bosses o' the herds.;
The midsized ones are the mother cows, and the li'l-bittiest ones are the baby calves.${prompt};
The calves are sweet little thangs.;
"Don't even have to hypnotize 'em; they'll follow their mother's scent just 'bout anywhere.${prompt}";
By the by, we got ourselves a bottle o' Eau de Buffalo here. We moogle cowpokes use it to disguise ourselves with the mother buffalo's scent. It's only got ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3} [dose/doses] left, but they're all yours, pardner.${prompt};
'Course, there ain't no need to fret if it runs out.;
Just brush yerself up against one of the mama cows and you'll get a natural shot of Eau de Buffalo just like that.${prompt};
But you'd best be careful, 'cause they be some hot-tempered heifers, y'hear?;
You'll be wantin' to sneak up on them from behind, all careful-like, to avoid their charge.${prompt};
As for the bulls, I'm quakin' in my boots just thinkin' 'bout 'em.;
They're the nastiest, most foul-tempered beasts this ol' cowhand's ever laid eyes upon.;
You'll be wantin' to steer clear of 'em and stick to roundin' up the cows and calves, kupo.${prompt};
And don't you be forgettin' that these buffaloes, they always act as a herd, y'hear?;
So don't go mixin' the herds, or we'll have a right ruckus on our hands.${prompt};
And you'd best take care to keep the chigoes away, too.;
One li'l bite from them and the buffalo will really start goin' loco, I reckon.${prompt};
With this here bottle o' Eau de Buffalo, we can make you smell just like one o' the buffalo mamas.;
It's runnin' low, though, so you'll want to be usin' it wisely, I reckon.${prompt};
Apply the scent?;
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
Sure.${prompt};
A dab or two o' buffalo sweat, a dab or two o' milk, and...kupo!${prompt};
You now smell strongly of buffalo!${prompt};
There ${choice-plurality: 2}[is/are] ${number: 2} remaining dose${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] of Eau de Buffalo.${prompt};
Sorry, pardner, we done exhausted our supply.;
Reckon you'll just have to do it the hard way...${prompt};
That's a cryin' shame, pardner.;
If'n you change your mind, just holler.;
We'll be here 'till the cows come home.${prompt};

Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Toro himself!${prompt};
Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Miura himself!${prompt};
Our wonderful workers of hide have fashioned this fantastic cap that can turn you into a buffalo calf, kupo!${prompt};
This conspicuously convenient cap was crafted by a masterful Moogle weaver and inexplicably increases the amount of time you can ride your mount, kupo!${prompt};
There's big trouble, kupo!;
Our most reliable moogle intelligence reports that an odious one-eyed demon known as a Pyracmon is using the Harvest Festival masquerade as a cover and trying to infiltrate the city even as we speak!${prompt};
We've been trying to warn people, but the bigwigs and guardsmen won't even give us poor little moogles the time of day.;
But you believe us...don't you, kind adventurer?${prompt};
Help a moogle in need?;
${selection-lines};
But of course!;
I think I'll pass.${prompt};
<Sigh> And here I had a devilishly delightful Harvest Festival costume handmade just for you...;
Oh well, looks like it's going back in storage until next year, kupo.${prompt};
Splendid, kupo!;
The first thing you'll need to do is eliminate the Pyracmon's malevolent minions, the wraith bats!${prompt};
These dastardly critters attacked us and sucked the moogle magic right out of us, kupo!;
Without it, even the sharpest steel won't so much as scratch the Pyracmon!${prompt};
For each bat you banish, we'll recover some of our magical powers, so lay waste to as many flying foes as you can muster!${prompt};
Report back here after that, and we'll channel that magic and whip up an incantation that will allow you to vanquish the Pyracmon!${prompt};
In the meantime, I'll use the meager remains of our magic to enchant you with a spell to aid in your battle against the wraith bats, kupo.${prompt};
There you go!;
Now have at those winged vermin!${prompt};
Back to help us rid the land of the vile Pyracmon?${prompt};
Need help with anything? Just say the word, kupo!${prompt};
Ask the moogle for help?;
${selection-lines};
I'm fine, thanks.;
I'm ready to take on the Pyracmon.;
I give up.${prompt};
Wow, looks like you managed to recover oodles of magic from those bats. Oodles, kupo!;
This should make for a potent incantation indeed!${prompt};
"Mind you, this enchantment won't last forever; if it runs out, you'll need to nab some more magic from the bats again.";
Now go send that ghastly Pyracmon back to the foul depths whence it came!${prompt};
Well, I'm sure a mighty adventurer like you has better things to do than help a poor little Moogle, kupo...;
Still, the Pyracmon won't rest until he's carried out his nefarious deeds, so do come back if you have a change of heart!${prompt};
Wow, you made mincemeat out of that Pyracmon! Just watching the battle sent chills up my little wings, kupo!;
You're the savior of the town and of all mooglekind!${prompt};
Though it may be unworthy of a great hero such as yourself, please accept this as a humble token of our moogle gratitude!${prompt};
For all we know, the Pyracmon is still lurking, just waiting for another chance to creep into our ranks.;
Should it return, please lend us your strength again, kupo!${prompt};
By the by, have you heard that some eerie and enchanting effulgences have emerged around the realm, kupo?${prompt};
Each one mumbles and mutters like a misanthropic miscreant, but pay them no mind.;
Well now, may mirth and merriment multiply for you during this celebratory season, kupo!${prompt};
My, my, my...;
What an intriguing spell you've learned, wayfarer.${prompt};
Yi-yi-yikes!;
Another pernicious puppet of Pyracmon is poised to pulverize us, kupo!${prompt};
Pyracmon?;
Hmm, that moniker may be gathering dust in the corner of my mind, but I do still recall it...possibly from some brittle tome written eons ago.${prompt};
It's the exorcist who made a deal with a de--${prompt};
Yes, yes, yes...now I remember.;
It is the name of a youthful yet promising exorcist who formed a perilous pact with a demon, only to become one himself.${prompt};
An exorcist who...hey! Don't put the chocobo before the cart!;
I don't remember selling my soul to a demon like that ecclesiastical abomination!${prompt};
Of course, but let us not dwell on trifling details.;
You there, adventurer. How about bestowing that boon upon us in a deal of your own? We shall certainly make it worth your while.${prompt};
Ay yai yai!;
I ardently advise against accepting an appeal as artful as this, kupo! You sobbed sanguineous streams in your quest to procure this potent magic--you shouldn't just give it away!${prompt};
Bestow the boon upon yon bats?;
${selection-lines};
Verily.;
Nay.${prompt};
How thoughtful of you to grace us with your presence--and your magic--yet again.${prompt};
I've never seen anyone go about business as slow as you! Was your mother a tortoise or something?;
Anyway, hurry up and give us that magic effect before we die of old age!${prompt};
That spell...equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...;
We must have it.${prompt};
What an exhilarating sensation! That last batch of magic was as potent as an Ahriman in rut.;
Should you chance to find yourself with a sorcerous abundance again, we will always welcome you with spread wings.${prompt};
I just know you're holding out on us, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...for now.;
Next time, try stocking up on more of that magic first.${prompt};
I knew you'd give us what we needed.;
Have this in return.${prompt};
Sordid scryers, ${name-player}! You just parted ways with all the magnificent magic you managed to muster, kupo!${prompt};
Well...I suppose there's still some enhancing magic left to help you rout those reprobate wraith bats...;
Let's get back to business before that brutish Pyracmon can ruin the rest of the Harvest Festival, kupo.${prompt};
I am literally spellbound, adventurer!;
Your contributions have surpassed our expectations. Take this as thanks from the bottom of our black hearts.${prompt};
It turns out the energy contained in these so-called “Middle Lands” isn't so middling after all. At least it'll be of use once our preparations are underway.${prompt};
Indubitably.;
While we must bid farewell to this continent, you can always use that headgear to fly over for a reunion.${prompt};
Hyah, hyah, hyah! How gullible you are!;
You may be well versed in the arts of magic, but your sense of humor still leaves much to be desired.${prompt};
...Until next time.${prompt};
What in the wide world was with those bizarre bats, kupo? I assumed they were allies of that apocalyptic abomination Pyracmon, but it seems my intuition was incorrect...${prompt};
But based on the variety of their vexing vocal vibrations, I'd say there were three theurgists controlling those preternatural parasites.;
All that's beside the point, I suppose. Now we've got to start over from scratch, kupo...${prompt};
This trace amount leaves our thirst for magic unquenched. The pact cannot be completed unless you return with the ordained measure.${prompt};
What do you expect us to do with these spectral dregs!?;
This is nothing! Nothing!;
Don't come back here again until you've obtained an amount decent enough to study!${prompt};
Your total...only equivalent to ${number: 0} mandragora-power...;
We require more...${prompt};
How...disappointing. Then I shall take your reply to mean you do not require a certain miraculous artifact we had been saving for you.${prompt};
...Fine! See if I care!;
In fact, I care so little that I'm gonna put a curse on you for refusing to help us, so there!${prompt};
...Of course you won't now...but you will eventually.${prompt};
Whew, for a moment I was positively petrified about your progression on this particular peregrination.;
Now that that's that, though, let's go pummel Pyracmon, puko! Er, kupo!${prompt};
Such arcane power could be put to much more productive uses than banishing that fairy tale of an exorcist...${prompt};
Should you take the time to charge that spell once more, we would certainly make it worth your while.${prompt};
Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, yet you cannot help but feel ill at ease...${prompt};
Kupopopo!?;
According to my observations, some occult object has emerged next to that eerie effulgence. Whatever could it be, kupo?${prompt};
A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Read about individual training.;
Review current training regime.;
Cancel current training regime.;
Read about elite training.;
Read about field support.${prompt};
Which page?;

I've changed my mind.;

“Elite training” is a section of the Field Manual which caters to dauntless adventurers who wish to engage in a more grueling test of their mettle.${prompt};
To participate in elite training regimes, you must acquire chapter transcripts, for which tabs are required.${prompt};
Trading ${item-plural: 35[2]}, gil, or a piece of equipment at designated locations (while in possession of a chapter transcript) will trigger the commencement of your training.${prompt};
Traded items will not be returned to you. You will, however, be furnished with rewards of correlating value upon the successful completion of each elite training regime.${prompt};
Even within elite training, there are regimes of varying difficulty. The trade limit for each succeeding chapter will be greater than the last, and the training objective more challenging.;
For safety reasons, all participants are recommended to be well prepared.${prompt};
Lastly, we at the A.M.A.N. recognize the importance of rest and recuperation as part of a healthy adventuring lifestyle. Therefore, a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all adventurers following the completion of an elite training regime. Until this time has elapsed, you will be unable to undertake further training, even if a chapter transcript is in your possession.${prompt};
You already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You cannot undertake a training regime while a hunt is active.${prompt};
Cancel hunt?;

You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets!;
You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.;
Greetings, adventurer!;
You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you?;
If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend!;
Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm!;
You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!${prompt};
Oh no! What a shame, kupo!;

What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!?;
Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!${prompt};
There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt};
What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!;
Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt};
We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.;
But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt};
There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.;
Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt};
Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.;
Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.;
It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt};
The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt};
In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.;
Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt};
Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt};
King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.;
How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt};
In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt};
“Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt};
Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.;
A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt};
We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.;
We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt};
Let's see...;
It appears that ${number: 0} moogle ${choice-plurality: 0}[tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.${prompt};

It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, glorious day!;
All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!${prompt};
Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air?;
You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...${prompt};
“Thrifty Transit”!;
A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer!;
For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!${prompt};
“Martial Master”!;
As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!${prompt};
“Blood of the Vampyr”!;
Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!${prompt};
“Treasure Hound”!;
With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!${prompt};

Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!${prompt};

What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm!;
What genius could have devised such commendable creations?${prompt};

Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo!;
Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.${prompt};

Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo!;
It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!${prompt};
“Bountiful Bazaar”!;
Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!${prompt};
“Swift Shoes”!;
This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!${prompt};

If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...${prompt};
What? What about the past, you say?;
Of course the magic won't travel through time.;
What a strange question, kupo...${prompt};
But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.${prompt};
The whole system is filled with mysteries.${prompt};
Oh, it's you! It's really you!;
The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!${prompt};
It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo!;
We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts.;

Hi there! I'm ${related-entity}, your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant!;
I'm in charge of running the ${choice: 0}[beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.${prompt};
I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too!;
You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Undertake training.;
Hear an explanation.;
What's the qualifying time?;
What's the fastest time?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}. Well, that's just too bad!;
It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem!;
The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!${prompt};
The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.${prompt};
But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree.;
The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!${prompt};
Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!${prompt};
With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da!;
Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.${prompt};
The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor!;
When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. “Smile helpers” are posted at each, so you can't miss them!${prompt};
Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage.;
The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?${prompt};
I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.${prompt};
Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!${prompt};
What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!${prompt};
Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!${prompt};
One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled.;
But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?;
So far, the fastest time in this area is ${number: 5} minute${choice-plurality: 5}[/s] ${number: 6} second${choice-plurality: 6}[/s]. Wow!;
And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is ${entity: 0}. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?${prompt};
We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within ${number: 1} minute${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] ${number: 2} second${choice-plurality: 2}[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young ${choice-player-gender}[wolf/vixen] like you, surely!;
And if you manage a time quicker than ${number: 3} minute${choice-plurality: 3}[/s] ${number: 4} second${choice-plurality: 4}[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?${prompt};
Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad...;
But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!;
At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of ${number: 6} gil from each participant.;
All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...${prompt};
Give to the children?;
${selection-lines};
I live to give!;
Charity begins at home.${prompt};
But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...;
Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!${prompt};
You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated.;
Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?${prompt};
There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you.;
If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>${prompt};
So, are you ready-steady?;
${choice: 0}[Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO!;
Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!;
Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.${prompt};
But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!;
Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness.;
Let's start from the top, shall we?;
Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now?;
Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Hear an explanation.;
Where're the smile helpers again?;
Cancel the training.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face...;
B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>;
Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we?;
You cleared the course in ${number: 4} minute${choice-plurality: 4}[/s] ${number: 5} second${choice-plurality: 5}[/s].${prompt};
Oh my Goddess! You've set a new record for this area!;
Hooray! Somebody, break out the fireworks!${prompt};
You've successfully qualified! Yay!;
Here's a little something to commemorate this marvelous achievement.${prompt};
You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night.;
The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>${prompt};
You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear?;
As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!;
Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification!;
As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.;
Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time.;
I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...;
It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation.;
Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!${prompt};
Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, “work hard, play hard” is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too.;
After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).${prompt};
Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy.;
But you have to be cruel to be kind. No more training until tomorrow, young ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]! No siree!;

If I were you, I'd step away from that thing.${prompt};
Hm? That ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you got there...;
Well then, that makes you ${name-player}.${prompt};
My name's Orgis, an' I'm a friend of Joachim's.;
I've heard much about the invaluable aid you've lent to our cause.${prompt};
Even havin' seen the state of our world, you keep on comin' back, over an' over.;
I'd say you're curious to a fault, mate. Either that, or you've got morbid tastes, I reckon.${prompt};
Funny enough, that's exactly the kind of spirit Abyssea wants for right now.${prompt};
Jus' so you know, the cavernous maw you see here won't take you to the South Gustaberg of Abyssea.${prompt};
Step on through, an' you'll find yourself standin' on the vast sands of the Altepa Desert. Yep, all the way over on Zepwell Island.;
All adventurers worth their salt would've been there a time or three. Don't know 'bout you, though.${prompt};
Word is, this discrepancy between entrance an' exit occurs with certain maws.${prompt};
Somethin' to do with dimensional misalignment, but that scientific stuff's waaay over my head.${prompt};
Jus' knowin' where a particular maw is gonna take me is plenty, I reckon.${prompt};
But gettin' back on topic. It's bleedin' obvious you're dyin' to throw yourself into this maw, so I won't keep you long.${prompt};
It's a well-known fact that folk of your world gain great powers when you set foot in our world, an' boy are we jealous!${prompt};
That said, there's one piece of information you oughta take with you...somethin' that jus' might save your hide, I reckon.${prompt};
An overgrown roc has been terrorizin' the folk of the desert. Size isn't the creature's only claim to notoriety, though.${prompt};
If the tales're true, it's also as quick as a flash, an' can kick up a fierce storm simply in the wake of its passage.${prompt};
I know a bunch of poor sods who had a run-in with the beast. They managed to shamble back to camp somehow, but not before...before most o' their skin 'ad been flayed off. Gore galore, I tell you.${prompt};
Altepa is right infested with swarms of savage fiends, but this roc looms heads an' shoulders above the rest.;
Stay away from the fiend if you value your skin--literally.${prompt};
If we could somehow do away with the hellish beast...but that's jus' some fool's dream.;
Might as well wait for hell to freeze over, or the skies to turn blue again, I reckon.${prompt};
Now, jus' one last thing before I let you go. Your ears are probably bent beyond repair from hearin' these words, but I feel obliged to say 'em to you anyway: my folk an' I are countin' on you.${prompt};
Ah, you're back. Seems there's more to you than meets the eye, mate.${prompt};
Even before we talked, I'd heard about your dauntless feats, but it never crossed my mind that you might be the one to eliminate that terrible menace.${prompt};
Thanks to you, the survivors in Altepa now dare to dream of better days ahead.${prompt};
I've brought a lil' somethin' for you, to help you on your way.${prompt};
It's ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, somethin' that's supposed to work like a charm for folk of your world.${prompt};
It's a bloody hard variety of the stone to come by, so don't go losin' it, eh?${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Each time I step into tranquil Vana'diel, it feels as though I'm wakin' up from a bad dream. If only that were the case, eh?${prompt};
An' speakin' of the devil, looks like my time's up.;
As much as I'd love to stay around an' chat, I've gotta get back to my livin' nightmare.${prompt};

Stratum abyssite.;

Atmacite.;
Periapt.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};

D-don't hurt me!;
I'm not a bad slime!${prompt};
Why, is that--<slurp>;
It is! Hi, ${name-player}!${prompt};
You were so wondergoo to me the last time around, and I hate to impose again...but I could really use the help of a ${choice-player-gender}[guy/gal] like you.${prompt};
Stupid ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ulta Slime] said he'd find someone, but he's such a <slurp> slowpoke!${prompt};
You p-promise? That's absolutely wonderful!${prompt};
Hmm...boy, this isn't any good at all.${prompt};
Stupid ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] said he'd get someone to help, but there's just no one to be seen!${prompt};
Oh my! Hi, ${name-player}!${prompt};
It's me, ${choice: 0}[Slabble/Slime Tarou/Sline]! You remember <slurp>?${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] said he'd be goospatching you! Are you here to help?${prompt};
You are? Gooray!${prompt};
Oh my! Are you the ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] told me to expect?${prompt};
You are? Gooray!;
My name's ${choice: 0}[Slabble/Slime Tarou/Sline]! Pleased to <slurp> meet you!${prompt};
If you're ready, I'll cast a gootastic spell so you can help gather my friends. What do you say?${prompt};
You found ${number: 0} slime coins for me. ${choice: 1}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] is just bouncing at the thought of providing you with some goodies. Want me to send you to him?${prompt};
What will you ask of him?;
${selection-lines};
${choice: 0}[Cast your magic on me!/Remove your magic from me!];
Send me to town!;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Okay! When you're done, come back and I'll regoove the spell!${prompt};
Stay safe, and thank you!${prompt};
Done already? I'll be here if you want to help again later <slurp>!${prompt};
No problem! Just talk to ${choice: 0}[Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] whenever you're ready to come back <slurp>!${prompt};
You acquire ${number: 0} slime coin${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], for a total of ${number: 1}!${prompt};
Welcome to the site of the sonically sublime show featuring the hot new morbol idol group, Shining Bless.${prompt};
In order to attend the concert, you will need to promptly procure ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Firstly, you'll want to speak with the merry moogle milling about town.${prompt};
Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that you've brought me, kupo.${prompt};
Okay, allow me to earnestly explain the concert details to you.${prompt};
First, any fans who want to participate will need to be sprinkled with a modicum of moogle magic.${prompt};
Once enacted, you'll be maxed out at Level 30, kupo.${prompt};
This is done to protect the idyllic idols from any crazed fans. They shouldn't mess with the morbol, or they'll get the horns.${prompt};
You never know what's going to happen at a live concert, but that's just part of the fleeting fun.${prompt};
Also note that each morbol has their own cherished choice of cheer. Try experimenting until you find the right one.${prompt};
Lastly, I've prepared a small souvenir for you, so stop by and pick it up after the show, kupo. (Requires ${number: 0} or more MOL)${prompt};
Thus concludes my extraordinarily efficient explanation. Are you ready to attend the concert?${prompt};
