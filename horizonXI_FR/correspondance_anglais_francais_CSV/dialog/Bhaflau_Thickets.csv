Tinga!;
Mind your manners!${prompt};

I won't always be around to take care of you.;
Try to understand.${prompt};
I don't need no one to take care of me!;
Stay out of my life!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
I'm sorry you had to see that.${prompt};
You're an adventurer, right?;
I've done a fair share of adventuring myself, traveling the world with my sword and my wits.${prompt};
It was not long after I arrived in Al Zahbi when I ran into Tinga.${prompt};
He had lost both his parents...;
An orphan...${prompt};
I tried to find somebody to take him in, but every door was slammed in my face.${prompt};
So I decided to look after him for a time and found myself getting attached to the little scamp...${prompt};
I couldn't just leave him and pick up my adventures again.${prompt};
I was going to continue my mercenary work here and raise Tinga as my own...${prompt};
But then I realized I could no longer swing a sword.;
It seems I've contracted some sort of illness...${prompt};
The doctor says there is not much time left for me.${prompt};
Before I pass from this life, I want to make sure Tinga has some way to support himself.${prompt};
Well, you can see how well that effort is going.;
He has no mind to begin a trade and is only interested in causing mischief.${prompt};
But deep down, I know he's a good kid.${prompt};
What do you say?;
Do you think you can help out a fellow adventurer?${prompt};
I need you to help me turn his life around.${prompt};
Any time I try to have a serious talk with him, he just runs away...${prompt};
To tell the truth, I have no idea where he is most of the time.${prompt};
Quite the dilemma.;
Perhaps I may be of assistance?${prompt};
!!!;
You would help us!?${prompt};
I'm not so cold-hearted as all that.${prompt};
The problem is how to draw Tinga out of hiding...${prompt};
How about we pretend to leave this ${item-singular: 0[2]} behind by mistake?${prompt};
Excellent.;
Please go on ahead. I shall join you once my work here is done for the day.${prompt};
Thank you, Ahaadah.${prompt};
Hail! I trust I did not keep you waiting too long?;

You've done well to obtain such an extraordinarily rare item!${prompt};
What's this!? You say you have something even more impressive for sale?;
Well then, my good merchant, lead on!${prompt};
Well, well. Look who decided to show up.${prompt};
Hey! Come back here!${prompt};
Aha.;
Nowhere left to run.${prompt};
What's wrong with you!?;
Do you want my autograph that bad!?${prompt};
Spare me your witty comments and return the item you stole.${prompt};
I didn't steal nothin'!;
I just picked it up!${prompt};
Enough is enough!;
You will return everything you've taken from my store!${prompt};
If you do as you're told, I might even reconsider the request to take you as my pupil.${prompt};
That old junk?;
I threw it away already.${prompt};
Threw it away...!;
Why even take it in the first place!?${prompt};
Heh heh.;
You're not alone, if it makes you feel any better.${prompt};
These saucers are from the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt};
These clothes are from Imeeya's store.${prompt};
And this carpet I got from Yazweel's place.${prompt};
I swiped all this stuff in half a day!;
You grownups are so pathetic!${prompt};
Not that I need any of it...${prompt};
You little...${prompt};
You got somethin' to say to me? Don't worry, none of that junk I just dropped was yours.${prompt};
That's the final straw!${prompt};
I've been lenient since you're just a child, but...${prompt};
You go too far!${prompt};
Give me back my carpet!${prompt};
Oh, calm down already.${prompt};
Calm down!?;
I'm going to go out of business if you break any more of my crockery!${prompt};
And you were the one who poked holes in all of my wares, weren't you!?${prompt};
My carpet!${prompt};
What's going on here?${prompt};
You...${prompt};
Tinga has ruined all of our livelihoods.${prompt};
Is this true, Tinga?${prompt};
So what if it is?${prompt};
Then you must apologize to everyone and give back all the things you took.${prompt};
What am I supposed to do with a pile of broken cups!?${prompt};
We don't need your kind around here!${prompt};
You probably put the child up to this in the first place!${prompt};
I never...! How could you...!?${prompt};
You're too sick to work and can't earn a living anymore.;
Isn't that right, adventurer?${prompt};
I knew you foreign adventurers were up to no good!${prompt};
Take your sneaking accomplice and get out of our city!${prompt};
Very well.;
I'll leave if that's what you want.${prompt};
But please, let Tinga stay.;
He's just a child.${prompt};
Tinga...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm glad I had the chance to meet you.${prompt};
Who cares?;
Why don't you leave already?${prompt};
I wish there was more I could've done for you...${prompt};
I said get lost already!${prompt};
Everything has gone downhill since I met you.${prompt};
...${prompt};
If you hadn't interfered, some rich family might have adopted me instead.${prompt};
I really wish you had just left me alone!${prompt};
But now it looks like I'm finally gettin' rid of you.${prompt};
I...${prompt};
I'm sorry...${prompt};
${name-player}. Ahaadah. Thank you for all your help.${prompt};
Alcander...${prompt};
It's fine, really.;
No one is to blame for this.${prompt};
That child certainly is a handful.${prompt};
What are we supposed to do with him?${prompt};
Who would take him in?${prompt};
Especially after that adventurer set him on the wrong path...${prompt};
You don't know what you're talkin' about!;
Alcander didn't do nothin' wrong!;
I'm the bad one!${prompt};
Who was the one who looked after me when I was all alone?;
Not one of you, that's for darn sure!${prompt};
Alcander was the only person who ever looked out for me!${prompt};
What the...!${prompt};
What's going on here, Tinga?;
I thought you hated Alcander!${prompt};
He's my best friend...${prompt};
If that's true, then why do all those terrible things?;
You've forced him away from you.${prompt};
I did it because I want him to stay with me...${prompt};
I know he's really sick and won't be around much longer, so...${prompt};
Ghosts always come out at night, you know.${prompt};
Why's that?${prompt};
Because it's scarier that way.;
Ghosts only show up when they hate someone enough to stay in this world.${prompt};
Is that true?${prompt};
Of course it's true.;
They come back to haunt the people who hurt them in life.;
That's what makes them so scary!${prompt};
I figured if Alcander hated me enough, then he would come back as a ghost...${prompt};
Then I could see him all the time...${prompt};
I see now...;
You poor child...${prompt};
But listen to me, Tinga.;
What you're planning is selfish.${prompt};
It means that Alcander must spend eternity feeling only hate and anger.${prompt};
Is that a fate you would wish for yourself?${prompt};
What's wrong, kid?${prompt};
Don't worry, everything will be okay.;
I was alone, too, but now I've met you.${prompt};
It's good to have friends, don't you think?${prompt};
I can't let this happen...!${prompt};
No, child!;
It's too dangerous out there!${prompt};
You have to bring them back.${prompt};
Who knows what creatures are lurking beyond the city walls?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Leave it to me.;
Not my problem.${prompt};
Have you no heart?;
You can't stand by and do nothing.${prompt};
Thank you.;
They can't have gone far.;
You can catch them if you hurry.${prompt};
You... You're that adventurer...;
Leave me be. I'm done for...;
Thank you...;
I am in your debt again.${prompt};
Although your effort may have been in vain...;
There is not much...${prompt};
Alcander!${prompt};
Tinga!?;
What are you doing out here? You could get hurt!${prompt};
Thank you for saving him...${prompt};
Tinga...?${prompt};
I knew somethin' was wrong.;
Even when I was causin' all that trouble so you'd come and see me.;
You were tryin' so hard to get me into that guild...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I couldn't take it no more!;
All that worryin' about what's gonna happen to me after you go away!${prompt};
Think about livin' instead!;
I don't want you to go!${prompt};
Tinga...;
I became so afraid when I could no longer wield a sword.${prompt};
I felt so alone.;
Even though I know that's not true...${prompt};
I've been saying this whole time how I want to save you from your fate.${prompt};
But I had it wrong.${prompt};
Tinga...;
You're the one who saved me.${prompt};
You're right.;
There's still time for me.${prompt};
I can't just give up.;
Somewhere in this big, wide world there must be a cure for my illness.${prompt};
And you.;
This is for saving my life. I hope it aids you in your adventures.${prompt};
You really should learn a trade, Tinga.;
You have to learn to stand on your own two feet.${prompt};
Okay.${prompt};
Meet me at Port Al Zahbi towards the south of town. Tinga spends much of his time there, and a little performance may be enough to draw the attention of our little fugitive.${prompt};
My apologies. I was accosted by a customer. Tinga should be running around the port somewhere. I shall join you in the chase momentarily.${prompt};
Tinga must have followed Alcander out into Bhaflau Thickets.;
They probably haven't gone far.${prompt};
You are their only hope.;
Alcander may have once been an adventurer, but his illness...;
He is in no shape to defend himself from the savage creatures out there...${wait-36: 2};
You must hurry!${prompt};
Alcander and Tinga are safe? That is good news.;
And they have begun a journey to search for a cure?;
I do hope they find one...${prompt};
This is the Mamool Ja staging point. What are you here for?${prompt};
You are trespassing on Imperial Army territory. If you have not received authorization, then you must leave at once!${prompt};
This is the Mamool Ja staging point. You are on Imperial terri...what's this?${prompt};
You have something to say? Out with it, now.${prompt};
Show him the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
I have nothing to say.${prompt};
You show the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Daswil grins slightly.;
Oho, so you brought me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
You must be one of Naja's messengers.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} contains oil from a berry that can only be found in a nation that lies to the far south, called Zhwa. It takes days to extract the oil. This is a highly valuable item...${prompt};
Stationed out in this forsaken land without all the trimmings of home, the scent of this oil is our only comfort.${prompt};
You'll have to pardon me. I owe you for your kind service.${prompt};
Hopefully you will find this information valuable...${prompt};
Do you see the glowing, blue design a bit behind you?${prompt};
That is a “runic portal.”;
Runic portals are used for transport to distant locations.${prompt};
They are a product of the great wisdom of Aht Urhgan's honorable alchemists. It functions by wondrous principles that are completely unfathomable to me.${prompt};
You don't need to understand how it works to be impressed by the runic portals, though. Simply use it, and then you will truly understand its excellence.${prompt};
A few hours' walk from here will take you to Al Zahbi, but with the runic portal, you can be there in the wink of an eye!${prompt};
Not only that, but if you travel to the capital from here, henceforth you will be able to return to this place using the same method!${prompt};
If you should ever have urgent business here at the Mamool Ja staging point, you can make good use of the runic portal.${prompt};
Is that so? Then you are trespassing on Imperial territory. Withdraw at once!${prompt};
Remember to use the runic portal if you ever have pressing business here at the Mamool Ja staging point.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s mercenary badge flashes.;
The mark of the wildcat? Did you become a mercenary for Salaheem's Sentinels?${prompt};
Oho! That's great! Naja has got you wrapped around her paw now, eh?${prompt};
You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Immortal.${prompt};
Your Imperial Standing has increased!${prompt};
There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt};
You can hear a strange voice...;
“Items, items, la la la la la～♪”${prompt};
Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya?;
You got nothin' on me, ${choice-player-gender}[man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.${prompt};
Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky!;
Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?${prompt};
I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.${prompt};
Now, listen close...${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.${prompt};
