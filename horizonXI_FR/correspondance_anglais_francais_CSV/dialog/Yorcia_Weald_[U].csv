${choice: 0}[Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!];
It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
Why, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!${prompt};
I wish you speed upon your journey.${prompt};
You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.${prompt};
Come back when you have the requisite certification.${prompt};
Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.${prompt};
Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?;
Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt};
The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt};
Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt};
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};
You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt};
In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt};
One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt};
Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt};
The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt};
You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt};
There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt};
The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt};
When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt};
A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt};
The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt};
I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt};
Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of ${number: 0} imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt};
It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt};
The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt};
The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt};
We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt};
The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt};
The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt};
We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt};
Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt};
The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt};
Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt};
We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt};
Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt};
The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt};
It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt};
Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number ${number: 1}.${prompt};

Behavioral research.;

Nothing.${prompt};
Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt};
It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt};
The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt};
Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt};
If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt};
While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt};
Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt};
For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt};
Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt};
You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt};
By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt};
The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt};
Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt};
Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt};
The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt};
Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt};
The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt};
The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt};
While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt};
Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt};
This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt};
Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt};
The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt};
Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt};
This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt};

You wish to exchange your sparks?;
Wait but a moment.;
Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.${prompt};
Ah, this almost slipped my mind.;
Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.${prompt};
Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.${prompt};

Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.${prompt};
Oh, crud, that's right.;
You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
“Why?” What a good question!;
Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.${prompt};
Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you.${prompt};

If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.${prompt};
Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...${prompt};
...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.${prompt};
Grrreat! Now I have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} from you. Thanks!${prompt};

Oh, spark exchange... Of course.;

Let me add one thing.;
Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
I'll make it worth your while...I swear!;
Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.${prompt};

Ugh, I rrraised my hopes up for nothing again.${prompt};
How imbecilic do these pioneers have to be to get caught in trrraps not even meant for them!?${prompt};
You know what we should do? Trap all the pioneers first, then we can catch snapweeds without any impedimentarus!${prompt};
That would take years.;
Are you just as idiotic as the pioneers?${prompt};
Y-you're the idiotaru! Can't you tell a joke when you hear one?;
Anyway, we need to think of a real solution-wution to this problem.${prompt};
...Aha! I've got it!;
It looks like I'm both the brains as well as the beauty of this trrrio. Just leave it to me.${prompt};
You there.;
Do you want to leave this place with all thirrrty-two of your teeth still in your skull?${prompt};
Well, do you?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
I'm not afraid of you.${prompt};
That's a good little ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl].;
However, you know very well that we can't uphold our rrreputation if we just set you on your merry way.${prompt};
Is that how you're going to be?;
Well, then, we can drag out the prrrocess as long as possible to make your tears all the more delicious, or...${prompt};
Prrrocure us ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]} and we may just “forget” you escaped.${prompt};
They can be rrretrieved from the carcasses of snapweeds you slay here in ${unknown: 0x01053782878280}.${prompt};
The only reason we set these trrraps in the first place was to catch snapweeds, so just give us what we want and we'll rrremove them.${prompt};
Allow me to summarize in case all my words confused you. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} in exchange for the safety of you and your mindless brrrethren.${prompt};
Why anyone would want to prrrotect such obvious defects of humanity, I know not. Still, I won't argue with an agrrreement that benefits the Coven.${prompt};
What do you say to our boundless larrrgesse?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, ma'am! I'll help!;
Get your largesse outta my face!${prompt};
Very well, then. Enjoy drrreading the time of your torture.${prompt};
It seems you're intelligent enough to at least grrrasp what your betters say.${prompt};
...Interesting.${prompt};
What a brightaru idea, Soraa!${prompt};
You expected anything less than brrrilliance from me? I'm shocked.${prompt};
Off with you.;
The longer you dawdle, the more of your frrriends get caught in our traps.${prompt};
And don't even think of brrreaking our pact, unless you want to see the flesh slowly seared from every pioneer who sets foot in the weald!${prompt};
Please forgive my prolonged tardiness, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Let's lie in wait here until the Blackthorn Coven arrives!${prompt};
What? You mean to say that you've already parleyed with that force of ultimate evil!? How unorthodox!${prompt};
They...want you to find ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}?${prompt};
...I see.;
I suppose it all makes sense if they only set those traps to loot the fiends they catch...${prompt};
What say you to me assuming some of the workload? It's the least I can do after making you face the Coven alone.;
I'll take ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 0[2]}, and you can take the rest!${prompt};
Obviously, I want nothing more than to rid the woods of these goddessforsaken traps...${prompt};
...but giving the Blackthorn Coven what they want also ensures another rendezvous with them.${prompt};
We simply can't have these atrocities incarnate skulking around as if this is their rightful domain. Who knows what terrible plots seething with ire they'd hatch if left to their own devices!${prompt};
In order to gain the upper hand, let's meet back here once we've found both the ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I'll give you my portion when we reconvene, then immediately hide amongst the vegetation. When those abhorrent witches appear, hand over the articles.${prompt};
Then, just when they let their guard down, I'll detain them all!;
Yes, this plan is so foolproof that not even an unconscious Velkk could foul it up!${prompt};
My dear ${name-player}!;
Are you ready to shift our plan into the next phase, perhaps?${prompt};
...To tell the truth, neither am I.;
The Blackthorn Coven wants us to procure ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}, right?${prompt};
Like I said before, I'll take the ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 0[2]}, so you only need worry about the rest. Fare thee well, ${name-player}!${prompt};
It required all my strength and cunning, but I was finally able to retrieve this for you.;
Here.${prompt};
Now that the stage has been set, I shall steel myself for the ensuing embroilment by retiring to this undergrowth.;
Goddessspeed, my friend!${prompt};
I thought the flesh would drrrop from our bones waiting for you. Well, it seems you were able to get the ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, so hand them over now if you want us to spare your contemptible excuse for a life.${prompt};
...Wait.${prompt};
Eeeeeeeeek!${prompt};
You must be an exorcist, seeing as how you have the fashion sense of an umbrrril. I thought you were supposed to be forrrmidable opponents, though, not mewling kittens.${prompt};
Unhand me this instant and slither back into the fiery hell from whence you came, you infernal scourge!${prompt};
That's quite the caustic-waustic tongue you've got there. Perhaps we should cutaru it out to teach you a lesson?${prompt};
You may be dull of wit, but at least your conviction's worth prrraising.${prompt};
I never expected someone with a crrretinoid face like yours to be capable of setting a trap for us.${prompt};
I'd normally claw out your eyes and dump you into some forgotten abyss...but you did give us what we asked. I suppose I can forrrgive you this once.${prompt};
You better thank your lucky-wucky stars our leader's so lenientaru!${prompt};
Let us begin the ritual...${prompt};
We'll be taking our leave now, but you and that milksop exorcist better be gone by the time we rrreturn.;
...Damnable witches! How dare they besmirch my good name and the name of exorcists everywhere!${prompt};
My sincerest apologies, ${name-player}. I thought not a thing could go wrong, yet I'm the one who botched the whole plan.${prompt};
Altana's light shines feebly through me, occluded by my sins and unworthiness. I must rededicate myself that Her light may shine pure and grant me the power to detain the Blackthorn Coven!${prompt};
Oh, I almost forgot! Please take this as a token of my appreciation for complying with this most ridiculous of requests. Now fare thee well, pioneer!${prompt};
Sorry I'm late to the--;
Leaping leafkin!${prompt};
How brazen-wazen of you weaklings to stroll so casually into our den!${prompt};
Calm down, Sis...${prompt};
How am I supposed to calm down when those widemouths could be licking their fingers clean-wean of Soraa as we speak!?${prompt};
Hm?;
Whatever do you mean?${prompt};
The Velkk think that we're in cahootarus with you, all because she saved your sorry behind!${prompt};
What a terrible lapse in judgmentaru! If it were me, I would've let them have their way with a whelp like you.${prompt};
So...I am the cause of all this...?${prompt};
Of course you are!;
Ugh, and this when we'd just sniff-wiffed out Mligni-Vorgut.${prompt};
Speaking of that incident...;
I should probably give this back to you.${prompt};
Huh?;
You earned that from your jauntaru to Dho Gates. Why would you bother returning it?${prompt};
As a token of gratitude to Soraa...for giving me another chance at life.${prompt};
...You do realize that we could very well just hand-wand it back over to the Velkk, don't you?${prompt};
Although they do think we're your allies, so maybe we can't...but that doesn't stop me from insultaruing your naiveté!${prompt};
If anyone's naive, it's you, Zunmimi.${prompt};
...<Sigh>;
Forget about it. Someone of my stature shouldn't stoop-woop so low as to bicker over trite banalities.${prompt};
Let me make this springwater-clear for you, imbecile. We don't give two licks what those troglodytarus are planning.${prompt};
What we're after is...${prompt};
Their treasure.${prompt};
Yes, their treasure.;
We only approached them to gain their trust. That way they'd invite us to their miserable excuse for a settlement and parade-wade the thing out in front of us.${prompt};
What, pray tell, would you want with a trinket from a band of savages?${prompt};
We seek to harness the inexplicably vast amounts of occultaru energy it harbors.${prompt};
The only reason we came swooping in from the west was that we simply couldn't ignore the intensely violentaru pulses of magical energy emanating from this region.${prompt};
Eventually, we discover-wovered that the source of that astral disturbance was none other than the Velkk's own heirloom.${prompt};
...Zunmimi.${prompt};
Yes, Melisandra, I'm quite aware that time is of the essence. I'm simply trying to exertaru an air of gravitas to make us look better.${prompt};
Your friend wouldn't have been captured if it weren't for me. Please, allow me to assist you! Surely it's the least I can do.${prompt};
We're not descending upon a few stray Velkk in Dho Gates--we're heading straightaru into their breeding grounds within Marjami Ravine. The only thing you'd be good for is feed-weeding their hatchlings.${prompt};
I am not so pompous to think myself capable of besting even one of these monstrosities in battle, but I am confident that I can at least distract them.${prompt};
So, you're willing to risk life and limb as a measly decoy-wecoy?${prompt};
If that is what it takes.${prompt};
Maybe I'm the one who had the lapse in judgment. You're surprisingly gallantaru for a priory peon.;
We'll be waiting in the ravine at G-10, then.${prompt};
We'd take you with us, but we don't want to besmirch-wirch your oh-so-renowned name. What sort of pioneer would you be if you couldn't even do a little bushwhacking?${prompt};
You heard her, ${name-player}! Let us show them the extent of our mettle and depart posthaste.${prompt};
${name-player}, the last thing I want is to be looked down on by a teensy Tarutaru. Let us make for G-10 in Marjami Ravine this very instant!${prompt};
You want to know about Robertioux?;
Sorry, but I've got much more importantaru matters to which to attend.${prompt};
Don't be such a fickle funguah! We didn't come all the way heah only tah be spurned like a toadstool! Just one itty-bitty-witty piece of infahmation will suffice.${prompt};
I haven't the time to waste on columnistarus when my ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}'s nowhere to be found!${prompt};
Huh?${prompt};
I must've dropped it while escaping from that abhorrentaru beast! How my skin crawls just thinking about the creature's slavering-wavering jaws!${prompt};
Oh, Goddess, why did it have to be that badge? Without it, I'm as dead as if the monster had ripped me in half--except this time it'll be a certain Mithra maester rip-wipping me a new one!${prompt};
...So, if we weah tah find this badge of yours, you'd give us the scoop-woop on Robertioux?${prompt};
Withoutaru question!${prompt};
Hey, you're good at this soht of thing, ahen't you? Then how about scratch-watchin' two Tarus' backs with one stone? I'm suah there'll be somethin' in it fah you, too.${prompt};
You'd truly-wuly be so kind as to search for it on my behalf!? I can't thank you enough!${prompt};
It ain't like we'll be doin' it fah free, though. “Quid pro quo” and all that. Now, wheah were you runnin' around like a panoptaru with its eye poked out?${prompt};
You think I stopped to check my map while fleeing for my life!? Hmmm, but if you held a musketaru to my head and made me guess, I'd have to say...around J-8 or H-9...or maybe I-8!${prompt};
That's a huge area. I'm sahprised you didn't faintaru mid-chase.${prompt};
Me, too. It comes with the territory-werritory, I guess. If you were stationed here, I'm sure you'd be able to run for malms on end as well.${prompt};
Well, you heard the lad.${prompt};
Mind scourin' those three spots? I'd help you out, but theah's no way my chubby-wubby legs would allow me to keep up with you.${prompt};
I can't say for sure, but I assume I lostaru my badge around the coordinates J-8, H-9, or I-8.${prompt};
I'm beg-wegging you, please find it for me. I'm as good as dead without it!${prompt};
I'd recognize that squeaky-weaky-clean shine anywhere! That's got to be my badge!${prompt};
I wouldn't be so concerned about getting this back...except that it's a replacementaru for one I had to chuck at another monster as a decoy two days ago.${prompt};
To be honest, I was already prepared to meet my maker-waker if you didn't find it. Now it's like I have a new lease on life! Thanks!${prompt};
Ah, no wondah. I thoughtaru it was rathah trivial of you tah be squawkin' ovah a few strings of thread.${prompt};
Okay, we fulfill-willed our paht of the bahgain. Now fah you to appease Adoulin's inquirin' minds.${prompt};
Inquiring minds?;
Oh, about Robertioux. Well, all I can say is that I accompanied him on his journey-wourney here.${prompt};
Come to think of it, an abomination of the forestaru attacked me then, too...${prompt};
Remind me to nevah bring you on an expedition that requiahs even a modicum of stealth.${prompt};
All my friends--Goddess bless them for sticking around--tell me I'm star-crossed in the most abysmal-wysmal way, and I'm apt to believe them after this.${prompt};
If I recall correctly...;
Yes, it was one of those dreaded Ahriman. Yet despitaru their horrid reputation, Robertioux wasted not a moment in dispatching the winged cyclops.${prompt};
Nary a complaint could be made about his technique, either. He certainly rival-wivals the Merciless One's prowess, if not surpasses it.${prompt};
By “Merciless One,” I take it you mean Ingrid, the exorcistaru assigned to the Middle Lands?${prompt};
By “Merciless One,” I take it you mean Ingrid? Didn't she just recently return from the Middle-widdle Lands?${prompt};
...Hmmm.${prompt};
“The surge of power ushered forth from his floodgates was enough to drown Ingrid in embarrassment!”${prompt};
“Read on for the triumphant story of Weatherspoon's latest and greatest hero, as told through the eyes of his Tarutaru companion!”${prompt};
Yeah, that sounds grandiose enough tah hook readahs' attention. Now tah flesh out the detail-wetails.${prompt};
Thanks so much, kid. Without your help, I'd nevah have been able tah write somethin' this rivetaruing!${prompt};
Robertioux's abilities certainly rival-wival the Merciless One's, if not surpass them.${prompt};
Oh, Alianne, I know I'm always bumbling-wumbling about, but if there's anything I can do...${prompt};
Your heart is kind, Emjook-Renook. They appear to be stable for now, but the situation could turn at any moment.${prompt};
...${name-player}? Why would you seek me out this deep within the jungle?${prompt};
You think it might be a contagion come back to haunt us?${prompt};
Curse me for not seeing it earlier! Their symptoms are virtually the same as Logan's!${prompt};
A disease of unknown origin-worigins stretching back to the Great Expedition!? I knew this “colonization” was a load of malarkey!${prompt};
So it's only a matter of time before I finally get to see mi casa again...!${prompt};
I knew the day'd come when you'd finally chicken out. When things get tough, we gotta stand up for ourselves, not quake in our boots 'n break water!${prompt};
B-Borghest? Why aren't you back in the basalt fields?${prompt};
Y'think Yorcia's the only place in trouble? Some of my men have been struck ill, too. First I figured they were just tryin' to get outta hauling a load of ore, but nope--they're as pale as a newborn babe's bottom!${prompt};
We gotta do something about this before our operations are completely crippled!${prompt};
And what would you have us do? Burn down the whole forestaru?${prompt};
Takes more than a bunch of twigs and leaves to take down an entire mining team. No, I'd lay my gil on the umbrils, comprende?${prompt};
And we all know fuego won't scare them.${prompt};
Then it's settled. We gotta find the real reason!${prompt};
Seems I'm always askin' for your help, but I need ya to haul yourself over to Foret de Hennetiel and tell the staff what we're dealing with here.${prompt};
Make sure they're fully apprised of the situation and are aware that we're askin' them for assistance!${prompt};
It is my sworn duty to tend to all who are ill, so I shall accompany you. They may have need of my healing skills.${prompt};
You won't hear any argument from me!${prompt};
Come, ${name-player}. We have not a moment to spare!${prompt};
Borghest is right. The best option is to inform-worm the coalition representatives in Foret de Hennetiel and beseech their aid.${prompt};
We're countaruing on you!${prompt};
Aaah!${wait-36: 1};
Oh, phew! ${name-player}, for a moment I thought you were a spirit risen from the grave!${prompt};
But, no...there appears to be nothing of the sort here. Thank the Goddess!${prompt};
...“Thank the Goddess”? What on Vana'diel am I thinking? A true exorcist stands strong in the face of danger!${prompt};
But I've never actually been out in the field before. I've pored over tomes, and attended numerous seminars, yet when it comes time to take one head-on...well, I'm less than confident.${prompt};
What are you doing out here?${prompt};
Robertioux!${prompt};
You have always been one to follow my scent like a hound looking for meat. What is it this time?${prompt};
It's...nothing like that. Before, I had just hoped to--${prompt};
You? So it was you?${prompt};
Is temperance not a word in your dictionary? Those uncouth “reporters” from the Scouts' Coalition are all but digging through my rubbish, and now you...${prompt};
I-I'm truly sorry.${prompt};
I trusted you, Erfimia.${prompt};
So, tell me. What dirt do you intend to sling in my face?${prompt};
Me? I swear upon the spirit of Jorius himself, I would never--${prompt};
Begone from my sight. I would have nothing more to do with you.${prompt};
That's so unlike Robertioux. Perhaps his ministrations are getting the better of him.${prompt};
Or maybe it's that he's not accustomed to being thrust into the limelight?${prompt};
That seems like the logical answer. Anyone who rises so quickly to the top is bound to make enemies along the way.${prompt};
I promise, ${name-player}, he's usually much warmer.${prompt};
Erfimia?${prompt};
Exorcist Frondeaubaire! Have you come to assess the site of Robertioux's latest banishment, too?${prompt};
In a manner of speaking. Undead are always a cause for concern, but there have been some irregularities in their appearances of late.${prompt};
What kind of irregularities?${prompt};
Undead take many forms, but lately all Robertioux seems to stumble upon are dullahans, which usually terrorize the labyrinth beneath Kamihr Drifts.${prompt};
Does it not strike you as odd that they would appear in non-trivial numbers here, so far away from their normal abode?${prompt};
Now that you mention it...${prompt};
At least our immediate surroundings appear to be safe.${prompt};
Perhaps we can find more clues around quadrant I-8 here in Yorcia Weald. That was where the initial sightings took place.${prompt};
And, yes, I do mean “we.”${prompt};
A-are you sure it's safe?${prompt};
I will not make it a compulsory part of your training, Erfimia, but it would behoove you to accompany us should you wish to follow in Robertioux's footsteps.${prompt};
A true exorcist must conquer her fear.${prompt};
<Gulp>;
Then I'll a-accompany you.${prompt};
Good.${prompt};
Oh, no...;
${name-player}, what will we do if undead really do show up?${prompt};
Wait, I know! ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};
But I've only got twelve on me. That should suffice if we run across a mere few, but Altana forbid we butt heads with a raving horde.${prompt};
Getting cold feet?${prompt};
N-no! I'm right behind you!${prompt};
${name-player}, I'm still concerned we might not have enough ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Could you procure ${number: 1} more?${prompt};
I'll meet you at the site!${prompt};
I'll meet you over in the general location of coordinates I-8!${prompt};
I knew I could count on you to pull through!${prompt};
With this many bottles, we can make those abominations wriggle in it.${prompt};
Hm?${prompt};
Frondeaubaire, did you see something? The...undead?${prompt};
...${prompt};
...No. Must have been the wind.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't you two, crawling around after me again.${prompt};
Not this time. We were searching for signs of the undead.${prompt};
Aha. You mean to steal my quarry.${prompt};
We would never...${prompt};
Robertioux...there's something strange about you.${prompt};
Wh-what are you on about?${prompt};
Come. Let me get a closer look.${prompt};
Back off, old man!${prompt};
After him!${prompt};
Robertioux fled to the southwest. Hurry, ${name-player}, before he gets away!${prompt};
${name-player}! Have you caught a glimpse of Robertioux?${prompt};
Me neither. Even Frondeaubaire is nowhere to be found. Yet they must be close.${prompt};
<Gasp>${prompt};
${name-player}! O-o-over there!${prompt};
Quick, h-hand me the ${item-singular: 0[2]}!;
Eeeeeeep!;
You know better than to traipse around where it is dangerous. Run back to town before you get hurt.${prompt};
But I can't just...${prompt};
Look out!;
Urk...!;
Robertioux! Are you all right!?${prompt};
Urrr...;
Graaaaaah!${prompt};
Oh no--Robertioux, what happened!?${prompt};
What--!?${prompt};
...Hmph.;
Haha...hahahahaha!${prompt};
Your eye! I-I don't understand...${prompt};
This is a demon's eye, Erfimia. But never did I think your ${item-singular: 0[2]} would sting me so.${prompt};
A demonic eye?${prompt};
Surely you would have heard the report about the frontier station worker recently assaulted by an Ahriman.${prompt};
I chased after the fiend to ensure the safety of all personnel there.${prompt};
And when I caught up, the pitiful creature groveled before me, begging that I spare him.${prompt};
In exchange, he offered me this eye...this demonic eye.${prompt};
It grants me sight beyond sight...the ability to scout out undead before they have the chance to victimize others. This “lens” has facilitated my hunting and vanquishing of the undead whenever and wherever they threaten to attack.${prompt};
How could you use such corrupt means!?${prompt};
Everything I have done has been for the Order of Weatherspoon.${prompt};
The exorcists were at our apex during the Great Expedition. We led the charge, banishing evil and marking success after dizzying success.${prompt};
And today? Today we are only ilms away from being reviled as deadweight relics from an era long past, pretending at witch hunting rather than protecting Adoulin's citizens.${prompt};
I, however, refuse to play the fool. Our existence is predicated on the quelling of the unliving and the banishing of the profane.${prompt};
Would you disagree?${prompt};
Of course not! But what you're doing is blasphemy!${prompt};
You want to prove we have a valued place in present-day Adoulin. That the Order of Weatherspoon is as illustrious as it ever was.${prompt};
But how can you live with yourself--let alone face Vortimere--knowing that you turned your gaze towards the very demons we are sworn to vanquish!?${prompt};
I do not answer to you, Erfimia. Report this to your superiors, should that please you. I am beyond caring.${prompt};
Now that this eye has been blinded, I am no longer of any use.${prompt};
I...${prompt};
Ah. There the lot of you are.${prompt};
Found more, I see.${prompt};
And dullahans, at that. Yorcia Weald has seen many horrors over the centuries, but this...${prompt};
At least no harm befell you.${prompt};
Presumably this was Robertioux's doing?${prompt};
...${prompt};
...Yes. It was.${prompt};
I would have expected no less. I declare this mission a rousing success. Come--we must make our report to the priory.${prompt};
...Of course.${prompt};
${name-player}, my head is spinning...;
Please, keep this between the two of us until I have time to figure out what to do. If this gets out in the wrong way...${prompt};
Take this in thanks for protecting me...and the secret we now share.${prompt};
I knew comin' out this fah would be worth it. Wait'll the coalition-wition gets wahd of this!${prompt};
Those s-s-scoundrels aren't here.${prompt};
No. They're too smart for that. Doubtlessly they have gone slithering into some dank ditch or hollowed-out tree stump.${prompt};
Then we b-b-break up into groups and hunt them down. Araustoix, I bid you go on that way.${prompt};
Understood, Lord Vortimere!${prompt};
Soraa?;
Soraaa!${prompt};
Shhhhhh!${prompt};
Soraa! There you are!${prompt};
Ever the dunce, Nashu. If you keep scrrreeching like that, your compatriots will find us for sure!${prompt};
S-sorry! I trekked out here to warn you that...wait. You already know, don't you?${prompt};
What kind of witches would we be if we couldn't see them coming malms away? If it wasn't for my keen eyes, the three of us would be toast.${prompt};
Just how are we supposed to unseal-weal this thing while we're on the lam?${prompt};
Huh? You're really trying to unleash its power?${prompt};
Who knows what kind of horrible curse this Velkk artifact might contain?${prompt};
Velkk artifactaru?${prompt};
No, no, it's nothing like that. One of our beloved ancestors-wancestors made it.${prompt};
What do you mean, “ancestors”?${prompt};
Magical curios like this don't just appear out of the sky. It's a valued rrrelic from our past.${prompt};
Spiritual incantations, the ebb and flow of magic, aurrras distilled to their very essence...;
Believe me, this much I know.${prompt};
So by what twist of fate did the Velkk get their grubby claws on it?${prompt};
Who knows? When your beloved king forced the Velkk to the westaru all those centuries ago, they probably nabbed this piece of work as they were hightailing it outta there.${prompt};
King? Centuries?${prompt};
Ugh. You exorcistarus are supposed to be students of history, aren't you? What a waste of air.${prompt};
Undo...the seal!${prompt};
But if we go traipsing about the forrrest now, your friends'll be on us like those Velkk on fresh meat.${prompt};
Oho, that gives me an idea! The two of you can go about unfetterrred, hm?${prompt};
What're you playing at?${prompt};
We need water of the purrrest kind to break the seal. I'd like you to scoop some up in our stead.${prompt};
What would we get out of it?${prompt};
We would get out of your hair. The trrreasure would be ours in full, and we would return to the west.${prompt};
An appealing prospect for all parrrties involved.${prompt};
...That makes sense.;
So, what do we do?${prompt};
That's a good little boy. We need you to get to the Pool of Clarity in Yorcia Weald, the Spring of Prrrosperity in Morimar Basalt Fields...${prompt};
...The Lake of Light in Sih Gates, the Sweltering Sprrring in Moh Gates, and the Saliferous Spring in Dho Gates. Once there, you'll need to fill these bags with a couple handfuls of the bounty there.${prompt};
As for us...well, we cerrrtainly can't stay here much longer. Meet up with us near K-7 in Cirdas Caverns.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Once again, we're made to dance like puppets.${prompt};
${name-player}, you take one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and I'll take the other.${prompt};
Let me handle the Pool of Clarity and Spring of Prosperity while you tackle the other three. How's that for a plan?${prompt};
The three loci you need to visit are the Lake of Light in Sih Gates, the Sweltering Spring in Moh Gates, and the Saliferous Spring in Dho Gates.${prompt};
Once there, scoop up some water to help the coven with their plan.${prompt};
Let's meet up in Cirdas Caverns once you're finished!${prompt};
${name-player}, look--the Ahriman!${prompt};
Could this be the same one that cursed Robertioux?${prompt};
Rober...tioux?${prompt};
It...talked!?${prompt};
Robertioux, yesss. A most faithful servant. He crushed my little puppets for me.${prompt};
Ah, but you've come looking specifically for me? Did silly Robertioux let out our little secret?${prompt};
“Secret”?${prompt};
Ah, so the truth has been laid bare. What a pity.${prompt};
So much fun we could have had--funny fun, too!${prompt};
But don't worry. I'm sure we can still play a little game, can't we?${prompt};
Come out, my pretty puppets!${prompt};
An ambush!?;
Erfimia!${prompt};
Leave the undead to us. Get the Ahriman!${prompt};
Now, now, no need to get all worked up. You haven't a snowball's chance in Tartarus of beating me.${prompt};
You think I couldn't have escaped back then? Believe me, it's so much more fun to feign defeat, hehehehe.${prompt};
Begging for my life to give Robertioux the Baleful Eye was my little act. Surprise!${prompt};
An act? What are you on about, monster?${prompt};
Hehehehe! Well, it was fun while it lasted, but it looks like that eye's seen better days.${prompt};
How disappointing. I had such high hopes too. But alas, you've fallen just as flat as the one before you.${prompt};
The one before him?${prompt};
What? You take me for an amateur? Surely you don't think you were the first.${prompt};
He was a good servant too, at least until the townspeople found out. A real killjoy, that one.${prompt};
What? That's not possible!${prompt};
What are you scheming, you fiend?${prompt};
Scheming?${prompt};
What is it with you people? Always seeing the worst in others. Always asking “Why?” or “How could you?”${prompt};
Who cares? I'm killing time. What else is there to do on this plane?${prompt};
Why can't you just take my eye and rebuild your little order?${prompt};
Think of how the order could have flexed its might and banished evil to the nether realm! Think of the role you would have played in it!${prompt};
Blasphemer! Do not involve us in your twisted games!${prompt};
Oooh, this one's got some bark! Pity his bite is that of a newborn babe.${prompt};
Well...<Yawn> I'm bored. Now that you've lost the eye's power, you're useless to me. I'm off to find a more tractable plaything.${prompt};
Wait!${prompt};
I...I had no idea Ahriman were so...talkative.${prompt};
Are they always like that?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Pretty much.;
I don't think so.;
There's something odd about it...${prompt};
I see... There's still so much about the world I don't know.${prompt};
I thought as much! Then what was that?${prompt};
Odd? In what way?${prompt};
<Chuckle> So it has come to this.${prompt};
Robertioux?${prompt};
I thought I had been doing Altana's work...but I was just that thing's toy the whole time.${prompt};
What...what was I doing? Where is the honor in this travesty?${prompt};
Robertioux...${prompt};
I have decided. I will reveal the eye to the order.${prompt};
To the order!?${prompt};
Are...are you sure?${prompt};
My mistakes are mine to bear, and I must see they are never repeated.${prompt};
The high exorcists will soon be holding the conferment ceremony at the Pool of Clarity here in the weald.${prompt};
I can think of no place more appropriate to cast off these shackles of deceit, and would ask you to let me take this first step myself.${prompt};
I understand.${prompt};
The order won't take his offense lightly... I hope he'll be alright.${prompt};
I'd like to be there for him, but we're not allowed anywhere near the ceremony.${prompt};
...Curse it all! I can't let him throw himself on their mercy alone.${prompt};
Come on, ${name-player}. We're going to the Pool of Clarity!${prompt};
Where is Lord Vortimere?${prompt};
Regrettably, he was called back to the priory on pressing business.${prompt};
How unfortunate. I...I had hoped to make confession before the ceremony.${prompt};
I will hear your confession, Brother. What troubles you?${prompt};
...This.${prompt};
Ah, yes. Your cursed eye.${prompt};
You, you know of it!?${prompt};
Yes. One of the Scouts' Coalition's operatives brought this matter to light.${prompt};
He threatened to publish the accusation, so we had to make certain he would never speak again.${prompt};
Wh-what did you do?${prompt};
Was it a sense of guilt that compelled this confession?${prompt};
You have nothing for which to be remorseful, Robertioux, nor are you the first to possess the Baleful Eye.${prompt};
Then you are aware...of everything.${prompt};
Nary a high exorcist passes but two moons without hearing the tale.${prompt};
Does that conclude your confession? Let us proceed now with the ceremony.${prompt};
No...I cannot.${prompt};
What is this? As I said, you need not feel any shame.${prompt};
Or would you prefer to share Pyracmon's fate?${prompt};
Pyracmon?${prompt};
Yes, the exorcist who took up the Baleful Eye before you.${prompt};
The rank of high exorcist did not yet exist in that era.${prompt};
Like the elder cyclops of legend, he was known as “Pyracmon,” a veneration given to him for his dominion over the sole eye.${prompt};
No. That cannot be...${prompt};
The Order of Weatherspoon would never honor such a man, knowing the full extent of his evil.${prompt};
Robertioux, you disappoint me. Do you still believe that we exorcists should all aspire to become immaculate saints and righteous philosophers?${prompt};
Let the lower ranks absolve the public of its sins.${prompt};
Those who would wield true power can ill afford such simpleminded scruples.${prompt};
No matter how long he toils, a man can never realize his true glory censored by plebeian moral proscriptions. You know this to be true.${prompt};
I once thought the same, but...I was wrong.${prompt};
The price we pay for clinging to power is too great.${prompt};
And what price might that be?${prompt};
Friendship.${prompt};
Fff... Wa! Ha! Haaa!${prompt};
Friendship? Friendship!? Are you still captive to such childish delusions?${prompt};
Faith, love, camaraderie...these are merely crutches for the weak.${prompt};
We are not like them, Robertioux. We have no use for such dubious fetters. There is but one thing we seek: power.${prompt};
Can you trust those without power to guard your life?${prompt};
The weak are fated to depend on their betters. They are naught but a burden dragging society down into the gutter with them.${prompt};
I, too, was once such a burden before acquiring the eye...${prompt};
But I was able to press forward, knowing that I had comrades looking after me.${prompt};
I thought that your acquaintance with the Baleful Eye would lead you to understand. How ironic that it was the eye itself which made you blind.${prompt};
What are you--!?;
See that he is properly...initiated.${prompt};
Uwaaaaaaaaagh!${prompt};
Although it pains me to lose such a promising disciple, you have made your choice.${prompt};
If the title of high exorcist disgusts you so, we can find a more fitting name.${prompt};
Yes, of course...“Acmonides”! What say you?${prompt};
Pyracmon's brother from legend! How becoming for one such as you.${prompt};
Well then, Acmonides, you are now free to reveal the truth to Lord Vortimere and to beg the masses for “brotherly forgiveness.”${prompt};
But who will they believe? A pariah, or those on whom they have depended for centuries?${prompt};
Erfimia? What are you doing here?${prompt};
Are you alright? I knew that the punishment for blasphemy would be severe, but--${prompt};
No...they knew all about the eye...<cough>... It is likely the reason they wanted me to join them in the first place. They welcomed me.${prompt};
What? That doesn't... How?${prompt};
Heh... Like me, they were so fervent about vanquishing demonic forces that they swore fealty to the profane.${prompt};
How could...this be?${prompt};
This is not over.${prompt};
I will not stop until the world has seen them for what they are.${prompt};
You're willing to go to war with the order?${prompt};
I must.${prompt};
I see. Well, I had hoped one day to become a great hunter of the undead, but it looks like my true quarry was a bit closer to home.${prompt};
What are you saying?${prompt};
That I'll fight with you. There's no way you can win this one on your own.${prompt};
Erfimia, are you certain?${prompt};
I can't just pretend this never happened. I became an exorcist to root out evil, be it from without...or within.${prompt};
Thank you. I...I am truly in your debt.${prompt};
You there, I hope you will not be offended if I refuse any more of your assistance. It would be wrong of me to involve an outsider any further in the priory's troubles.${prompt};
This is an age-old rot at the very heart of our order. It can only be cured from within.${prompt};
He's right, ${name-player}. The road ahead will be a hard one, but it's better if we face it alone.${prompt};
No, we won't be alone. Exorcist Frondeaubaire might be convinced to join our cause. I'm sure that many in the priory will feel the same way.${prompt};
Here, I want you to have this. After all the trouble I dragged you into, it's the least that I can do. Thank you.${prompt};
To tell you the truth, part of me wishes that I was still in the dark about all this...${prompt};
But it's an exorcist's job to drag the truth into the light, and confront the darkness in all its forms.${prompt};
What kind of exorcists would we be if we gave up now?${prompt};
You're a good person, ${name-player}. Keep on walking that path...and never look back!${prompt};
The sky is so gloomy-woomy here... I wish I were back in Adoulin, with blue skies and sunny summers...${prompt};
You there, ${choice-player-gender}[caballero/caballera]! I've got a little-wittle task for you.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition is in need of a specialist of my stature to collectaru informacion about numbing blossoms, and I'm in a bit of a bind.${prompt};
Many of these impedimentarus grow aqui in Yorcia Weald, and I'm in charge of studying how they grow.${prompt};
Care to gather some soil samples for me?${prompt};
There's a reason I can't go myself, ${choice-player-gender}[hombre/muchacha].${prompt};
I've never been good at reading a map, and if I go so much as half a malm away from a waypointaru I get hopelessly lost. Vale?${prompt};
Simply put, I'll get eaten-weaten alive.${prompt};
So, andale! I'm not getting any younger!${prompt};
You gathered some dirtaru for me? Muy bien!${prompt};
Madre mia--look at all this pollen-wollen!${prompt};
Si, this will make excellentaru research material.${prompt};
You've done a wonderful job, mi ${choice-player-gender}[amigo/amiga]. Here's a presentaru for you.${prompt};
Hey, my favorite colonizador${choice-player-gender}[/a]! I've been waitaruing for you.${prompt};
I investigatarued the earth you brought me, and made a startling discovery. These flores--they don't just paralyze people, but they are partly connected with the pollution-wution in Ulbuka we've all come to hate.${prompt};
La tierra, she grows numbing blossoms because of the poison. Or maybe it's the blossom-wossoms themselves that poison the land. We aren't sure yet.${prompt};
If you have a spare momentaru, collect ${number: 0} of the blossoms for me, por favor.${prompt};
Ay caramba, don't look at me like that. You know how hard it is for me not to get lostaru! So please--do me this deed.${prompt};
Pull up ${number: 0} numbing blossoms and bringy-wing them back to me, comprende?${prompt};
You're back so soon--estupendo! These will make excellentaru specimens.${prompt};
I've been estudiando the bounty you brought me and I've reached a startling-wartling conclusion, ${choice-player-gender}[hijo/hija]. The corruption in the land is deeper than we previously thought.${prompt};
Bendito! The blightaru is such that it feels some terrible demons must buried deep beneath the surface.;
But a scientistaru always goes with evidence, not speculation. More work is needed.${prompt};
You understand what that means, no? Findy-wind me ${number: 0} more numbing blossom${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] and I'll give you another reward.${prompt};
Tear 'em up from the ground and deliver them to me whole, de acuerdo?${prompt};
Numbing blossoms collected: ${number: 0}/${number: 1}.${prompt};
How odd... The soil and plants here don't seem to be suffering from the corruption that the surrounding area does.${prompt};
I wonder if it means that the energies of the ergon locus here have some sort of cleansing effect on the land...${prompt};
There's only one way to find out--take a sample and bring it back to the coalition for analysis.${prompt};
How do you address him?;
${selection-lines};
Midras.;
Junior.${prompt};
Aaah! Don't sneak up on me like that!${prompt};
I thought some strange beast had come to eat me alive!${prompt};
Why do people keep calling me Junior!?${prompt};
I have a name, you know. “Midras!” M-I-D-R-A-S.${prompt};
Oh, but look who it is. ${name-player}, come to bother me again, no doubt.${prompt};
Wait--Amchuchu sent you again, didn't she? I swear, if that woman put half of the energy she spends worrying about me into her work...${prompt};
By Altana, she's like an oppressive mother, doting after me like I'm some six-year-old!${prompt};
Hmph. There are worse things, I suppose.;
If she sent you here, then she must have also mentioned that I'm here to study the ecology of Yorcia Weald.${prompt};
It's really something else. All manner of plant life sprouts up like weeds despite the poison saturating the soil.${prompt};
But here, right where we stand--the land suffers no ill effects at all.${prompt};
If we can figure out why, then we'll be able to create an even more potent fertilizer! That's why I'm out here in the middle of nowhere--to collect samples and return back.${prompt};
So now that you've “confirmed my safety,” scram back to Amchuchu and tell her to stop bothering me.${prompt};
Wait a minute, ${name-player}. There may be something you can do for me.${prompt};
I need someone who can use the waypoints like you to do me a favor.${prompt};
I need you to bring something of mine to a certain acquaintance of mine at the Tenshodo in Jeuno.${prompt};
Ah, but wait--you don't have a free pass to visit people there just because you're from the Middle Lands.${prompt};
In fact, I doubt you could even get inside.${prompt};
Maybe you're of no use to me after all. <Sigh>;
Better get back to it, then. I normally don't say this, but sorry for wasting your time.${prompt};
If you knew someone at the Tenshodo, you might be able to help me...${prompt};
...but you don't, do you? So get back to Adoulin and leave me to my work.${prompt}.;
Well, well, if it isn't ${name-player}.${prompt};
Oh ho? You know someone at the Tenshodo?${prompt};
You've heard of the Tenshodo, right?${prompt};
I need you to bring a little something for me to a guy named Aldo.${prompt};
It's a document containing information about the explosives I used in Cirdas a while back.${prompt};
Help out Midras?;
${selection-lines};
Let's rock.;
Act as cold as a stone.${prompt};
Outstanding! You know, ${name-player}, you're not half bad.${prompt};
I'll be heading back to the Inventors' Coalition as soon as I'm finished here.${prompt};
And of course, I'll tell Amchuchu to be expecting you.${prompt};
Report back to the coalition once you're done.${prompt};
Are you serious? With the waypoints, it's not even that far!${prompt};
You're the only one I can trust with this. Would you please rethink your decision?${prompt};
I've got enough plants for now. Just need to take a couple soil samples...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The leafkin snatched away Midras's samples!;
Hm? ${name-player}? Is that you?${prompt};
Odd. I could have sworn I heard something.${prompt};
...!${prompt};
(Omega, we are waiting for your report.)${prompt};
(This is Omega. I will have something to report to you soon. Within the next few days, at the latest.)${prompt};
(I am in the process of acquiring samples that will shed light on the effects these special energies have on the land.)${prompt};
Wait--my...my samples!${prompt};
Nooooooooo!!!${prompt};
I knew Midras was up to no good.${prompt};
Oh? What's this, then?${prompt};
(Omega, is everything okay?)${prompt};
<Gulp>${prompt};
(Y-yes! Nothing to report here!)${prompt};
(...You are not Omega.)${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The linkpearl shatters into grains of dust.;
Damn it! I shoulda just kept my mouth shut.${prompt};
On the bright side, now I know that Midras has been communicating with someone.${prompt};
There's no time to waste. I must report this to Gratzigg immediately!${prompt};
<Huff> <puff>;
What is this stupid thing!?${prompt};
The way it looks at me with those eyes, choking every fiber of my being...${prompt};
And what is it with those leaves? Just what exactly are they covering?${prompt};
Ugh, just thinking about it gives me goosebumps!${prompt};
Adoulin truly is a terrifying land filled with all manner of nasty monstrosities.${prompt};
My linkpearl and report--where did they go!?${prompt};
This is terrible. I must have left them behind.${prompt};
But what if that...that thing comes back to assault me? No way I'm going back there!${prompt};
I'll have to return there tomorrow. Hopefully it'll be safe then.${prompt};
So I, uh...;
Hey there.${prompt};
(Urk...I don't care how many times I see one of these things. They still creep me out.)${prompt};
I remember the last time I was here. I was too scared to press forward.${prompt};
But this time's different. This time I won't turn away!${prompt};
You've probably got better things to do, but indulge me this once.${prompt};
You see this locket? It was my father's.${prompt};
So you stand there...and I'll place it between us...;
...prepare the powder keg...${prompt};
...and it'll explode ${number: 0} second${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] after I flip the switch. That's your signal.${prompt};
Whoever reaches the locket first is the winner. What say you?${prompt};
If you're worried about the powder keg, don't be. It'll cause a few sparks, and nother more.${prompt};
(Okay, just stay calm...${wait-36: 3};
...here we go!)${prompt};
Ready?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Midras flips a switch to start the keg's countdown.;
Have any thoughts of support?;
${selection-lines};
You can do it!;
Wait, not yet! (Cancels event)${prompt};
Ugh. Look at me--I said I wouldn't turn back this time, but...I guess I'm just not ready.${prompt};
Next time though, Ygnas--will you be ready?${prompt};
Okay--I'm good to go. Let's go over the rules once more.${prompt};
(Damn it! That was a bit of a false start.)${prompt};
(Damn it! I was a bit too slow.)${prompt};
Let's uh... Let's try this again.${prompt};
(Got it!);
Yikes!${prompt};
(That's what I get for focusing too much on the locket. Well, that's Yorcia Weald for you...)${prompt};
(Thank goodness for Ygnas, or else I might have been Hume tartare.)${prompt};
You've bested me. I can admit it.${prompt};
But I can hold my head high, because I didn't back down and accomplished what I came here to do.${prompt};
But one day, I swear--I'll get it back. You'll let me do that much, right?${prompt};
And now I'm absolutely filthy. This is just great.${prompt};
Hang on--I remember what I was trying to study: the cleansing properties of the Ergon Loci.${prompt};
Perhaps...perhaps we can use them to improve the flavor of the Arboretum's vegetables!${prompt};
I gotta go back and share this with Amchuchu.${prompt};
(What an odd helmet.)${prompt};
(It talks! It talks!)${prompt};
(I feel it would behoove us to take possession of such an odd contraption.)${prompt};
Hm? What is...?${prompt};
Ack!${prompt};
I thought the leafkin were creepy, but those things...those things...;
Sometimes I wonder if this continent is too much for me.;
Fremilla would surely be interested in your findings.;
Hmmm...${prompt};
The exorcists usually gather here around this time, and I thought maybe I could see the coven first...but maybe they returned to the west.${prompt};
Nashu...;

A-a talking bat!?${prompt};
What kind of a dullard exorcist-wexorcist has never heard of a familiar before?${prompt};
Looks like...we got him.${prompt};
Wha...a joke!?${prompt};
The look on your face is absolutely prrriceless.${prompt};
Hahaha! I'll admit--you got me good. Just let me...catch my breath...${prompt};
Ah, but hold on. I came to this place to deliver a message.${prompt};
Remember this exquisite piece of jewelry you offered to me? I wanted to offer my thanks.${prompt};
I owe the three of you so much.${prompt};
Nashu, I know not whether it suits your fancy, but it means so much that you've taken such good carrre of it.${prompt};
So if anyone should be thankful, it's--${wait-36: 1};
Look out!;
Gah!;
Eeek!;
Urk...;
...${prompt};
Soraa? Soraa!?${prompt};
Grk grk grk...;
Found you, fleshy one.${prompt};
I not forget how you embarrassed Velkk.${prompt};
Mligni!${prompt};
(Wh-what do I do now? Without the Blackthorn Coven, I've no hope of besting him.)${prompt};
(Think, Nashu. Think!)${prompt};
Grah! What little leafy thing is this!?${prompt};
I no have time for this. Kill them all!${prompt};
I, uh...;
Okay! Let's do it!${prompt};
I'm not gonna back down now!;
I think...I think we...did it...${prompt};
${name-player}, it's you!${prompt};
Mligni came here to seek revenge for his defeat in the caverns.${prompt};
But this little leafkin here, he...she?...came to my aid.${prompt};
But the coven's familiars... I'm afraid they weren't so lucky.${prompt};
Grk grk grk...;
Beat me once, shame on me. Beat me twice...${prompt};
...shame on you!${prompt};
Graaaaaah!${prompt};
H-how can he still be alive!?;
Noooooo!;
Mligni make big, big mistake.${prompt};
You only fodder for Adoulin cannons and been big thorn in hide.${prompt};
Is that...Gramk-Droog!?${prompt};
And the other Velkk--it's a veritable who's who of crocdom!${prompt};
Things have just gone from bad to worse!${prompt};
Hm? Well, well, look who here!${prompt};
Mligni do very well.${prompt};
It now time for Velkk to claim what is ours!${prompt};
I send you to hell that claimed founder king!;
D-defeated!? Our ancestors...not be happy...;
${name-player}, is it...really over?${prompt};
What trickery went down here?${prompt};
Soraa--look over there!${prompt};
Nashu! I'm so glad you're safe!${prompt};
Thank you, Soraa.${prompt};
When you set out to prrrove yourself, there's nothing you can't do. I'm so proud!${prompt};
Pray tell, Nashu, what happened?${prompt};
Well, first Mligni-Vorgut appeared from the shadows to assault us...${prompt};
...then, although we succeeded in pushing him back, he used some form of teleportation magic to take us here...${prompt};
...right into the clutches of Gramk-Droog and his cronies.${prompt};
That explains why you failed to show at the council's dispatch.${prompt};
But I must confess that what was supposed to be a mere training exercise turned into something much more. Your bravery is to be commended.${prompt};
Thank you for your kind words, but I owe my success to ${name-player} and this leafkin here.${prompt};
Well, well, this is a surprrrise!${prompt};
I wonder what your sister-wister would say if she knew you were here.${prompt};
Leafkin have sisters? Well, maybe I shouldn't be so surprised, but--${prompt};
Nashu, don't tell me you stood at his side without noticing that--${prompt};
--Well, it matters little to me, but don't you think that seeing through illusions is part of your trrraining?${prompt};
Illusions? Well, who is this leafkin? Tell me!${prompt};
Nope.${prompt};
Well, Nashu, now that we've met face-to-face, I think it's time for us to deparrrt.${prompt};
And we shall take our leave as well.${prompt};
Nashu, tomorrow we are to make a pilgrimage to one of the exorcists' most holy sites.${prompt};
The journey will be fraught with peril, so I advise that you return home for a day's respite.${prompt};
Understood!${prompt};
Soraa...Zunmimi...Melisandra...and ${name-player}.${prompt};
The next time we meet, I will have claimed the title of High Exorcist and led Adoulin into a new era of prosperity!${prompt};
Nashu, I laud you for your ambition, but some dreams are best left as dreams.${prompt};
Becoming the High Exorcist isn't a goal you just announce to a cadre of outsiders.${prompt};
But your future remains bright as the noon sun, and I know you will serve the city well.${prompt};
Nashu, we'll be waiting for you to succeed.${prompt};
Well, we'll at leastaru be waiting.${prompt};
I won't let you down!${prompt};
Then before we leave, I've got a little something to say.${prompt};
Melisandra! Let him go this instant!${prompt};
But...he's so cute.${prompt};
Sometimes I wonderrr if you're as dense as Nashu.${prompt};
Until next time, “High Exorcist”!${prompt};

Palomel!? Why are you--${prompt};
Urk...I can't--${prompt};
No!${prompt};
I can't...let it end like this...${prompt};
You humans certainly have a penchant for attempting to punch above your weight.${prompt};
You had your chance to bring down the house, and yet you're the ones being brought down...by someone of no material use to you.${prompt};
What trickery...is this? Lola, I...I'm sorry...${prompt};
Bwehehe! All the cards have been played, and our two challengers are a few short of a full deck!${prompt};
How did you enjoy my little game?${prompt};
I expected you to fold earlier, but your tenaciousness is to be lauded.${prompt};
Wh-who are you?${prompt};
Tut-tut. You're the only little group to have gotten this far, but that doesn't mean you won all the answers.${prompt};
Why, I even let you play the lightning round...with real lightning!${prompt};
<Gulp>${prompt};
And all that was just with a little adumbration of mine. And in the end, the house won.${prompt};
What...what are you going to do with us?${prompt};
Your friend there is about to kick the bucket, don't you think?${prompt};
I left my pocketwatch back in the green room, but I'm sure he's only got a few ticks left.${prompt};
Humanity can be so...squishy. One little flick and you go splat.${prompt};
But you've made it past the prologue and got all the way here. Impressive.${prompt};
You know what? I like you. Bwehehe!${prompt};
And because I like you, I'll offer you a deal.${prompt};

Ohoho! Time's up, little lady!${prompt};
Bwehehehe! What a pitiful soul you are, choosing between two bad options so easily!${prompt};
I've got some bad news...I'm going to take both!${prompt};
N-no! You can't possibly mean to...${prompt};
P-please stop! I don't care what happens to me, but don't harm my little girl!${prompt};
Hmmm...perhaps we can reach an accord.${prompt};
If I alter your memory of the whole incident, then you'll never realize what you've lost.${prompt};

Oston! Oston, wake up!${prompt};

Ugh! Let me...down!${prompt};

It's no use, ${name-player}! I can't get out!${prompt};
Wait! We're not here to hurt you!${prompt};
Right, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Hey--! I...;
Ouch!;
Uwaaaaaaaaah!;
I think...I think I sprained my ankle.${prompt};
<Forgive our trepidatiooon, young ones.>${prompt};
<The treees called out to me, saying that his sword was approaching...;
...Ortharsyne.>${prompt};
Her voice, it's...implanting itself in my mind?${prompt};
Then you can hear it too, ${name-player}?${prompt};
This is no ordinary leafkin. Do you think she--${prompt};
<Welcooome, children of Altana. You come to me like petals on the wind.;
I am Rosulatia, and I serve the leafkin as the great motherseed of the World Tree.>${prompt};
The leafkin queen...so the legends were true.${prompt};
<You, young seeedling. In what season did you come to possess his sword, the one he used when he fought by our side in time gone by? What name have they beeestowed upon you?>${prompt};
Y-Your Highness...I am Arciela V. Adoulin, younger sister of the head of the Order of Adoulin.${prompt};
<Then you are the fruuuit of his tree?>${prompt};
Umm...I...${prompt};
I am the direct descendant of the founder king, if that is what you mean.${prompt};
<My apologies, little plumule. It has been so many years that I forget huuumanity does not bud like we do.>${prompt};
<This...descendant. Did you flower from his spore?>${prompt};
<Then the plants wish to iiinquire something of you, descendant--she who follows his path.>${prompt};
<Why do you seek only to harm the foreeests?>${prompt};
<Yggdrasil, the great World Tree, has given her bleeessing to this land. Why must you take it away?>${prompt};
Yggdrasil...${prompt};
${name-player}, have you ever heard of the World Trees?${prompt};
Are you familiar with the World Trees?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
The world has lots of trees...${prompt};
“The Twin World Trees” is a story most every Adoulinian hears when growing up. Queen Rosulatia, do you mean there is one here...in Yorcia?${prompt};
<Two World Trees provide bountyyy and succor to all of Vana'diel...>${prompt};
<One stands proud and majestic far across the seas in the land you call Rhazowa, supporting all the world with her rooots.>${prompt};
To think one really exists...and in Rhazowa, of all places...${prompt};
<The second, booorn from a single branch taken from the first, and transplanted here in Yorcia...>${prompt};
<...by the founder kiiing.>${prompt};
<The secooond World Tree is our mother. We are the seeds and fruits of her love.>${prompt};
<We have inheriteeed a portion of her supernal essence, with which we serve the land.>${prompt};
<Her leaves bestowed upon us grace. Her limbs, courage. Her trunk, resilience. It is through her bark that we have sealed the darknesss that once gripped the land far beneath this surfaceee.>${prompt};
<But the World Tree to the north is no mooore. Her child--our mother--clings to life, but has been stricken with a vile taint for many years.>${prompt};
She's fallen ill?${prompt};
<Not just any illness, dear bud. It is a corruption as black as demons.>${prompt};
<As twilight fades and dusk approaches, our kind, which require resplendent sunliiight and pure water, find ourselves succumbing to the poison within the laaand.>${prompt};
<And as we suffer, so tooo does Mother.>${prompt};
<Yet humanity...you continue to pillage the forest and raaavage her children. And your evils have only worseeened with time.>${prompt};
I...I don't...${prompt};
<So I aaask you, “descendant”--do not harm us any longer. Leave this place, and never set foot upon this soil again.>${prompt};
What now?;
${selection-lines};
Ask about the recent changes.${prompt};
<Seedling...your rooots are not of this land.>${prompt};
<...An adventureeer...from the Middle Lands...>${prompt};
<My wooords alone are but a whisper, yet to appreciate their gravity you need a roar. Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to the only pure spring left deep within this land.>${prompt};
<If, my sprouts, you are the true bearers of Ortharsyne, and within you lies his spiriiit...>${prompt};
<Then Mother may deem you fit to receive saaalvation.>${prompt};
<Be aware, though, that you may suffer nothing but diiisappointment.>${prompt};
<Just as we have suffered at your hands.>${prompt};
<I shall give you a hiiint on where to find this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.>${prompt};
<Our brethreeen who bring life to the land had also inherited a portion of Mother's power.>${prompt};
<That is all the guidance I could proviiide you with. Seek them out.>${prompt};
<If you truly understand the beatiiings of the forest's heart, then you shall have no trouble at all.>${prompt};
Start from where?;
${selection-lines};
The start.;
Square one.${prompt};
${number: 0};
${number: 1};
${number: 2}${prompt};
<So you managed to successfully fiiind ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.>${prompt};
<Children of man, Mother has recooognized you...and so too shall I.>${prompt};
<Place what you have found into the spriiing, and open your hearts and minds.>${prompt};
This strange sensation...impressing itself upon my very thoughts!${prompt};
Can you see it, ${name-player}? Images and energies floating within your mind...?${prompt};
<What you see before you is an imaaage of a land far across the seas...the land you call “Rhazowa.”>${prompt};
<...And what it looked like many, many years aaago.>${prompt};
This...was Rhazowa?${prompt};
<And also what the founder king took with him...a piece of the World Tree.>${prompt};
The twin World Trees...;
Never before have I laid eyes on anything so grand and beautiful.${prompt};
<This sereeenity was not to last. Tragedy soon came to Rhazowa.>${prompt};
The Orcs, they're--they're burning the World Tree!${prompt};
This must be the sordid invasion of the Orcish horde into Rhazowa.${prompt};
<Yes, descendant. On this daaay, the World Tree in Rhazowa was turned into cinders, its grace lost forever.>${prompt};
No...it can't be!${prompt};
<Yet the travesty continuuued. Mother was inexorably intertwined with her twin, and she began to warp and change.>${prompt};
<Unable to maintain the form and shaaape she once had.>${prompt};
This is just too cruel!;
The World Tree...;
The forests...;
All gone...${prompt};
<When the World Tree in Rhazowa was iiincinerated, Mother began to weaken. She took all the energy she had left to protect the land and stored it in her roots, which she seeent out grasping throughout Ulbuka.>${prompt};
<It is as you would eeexpect. Her very roots support the weight of the world.>${prompt};
The roots that dot all of Vana'diel--they belong to her?${prompt};
<When her power had waned to the point of being snuffed out, she used eveeery last ounce inside her to bring budding new life into the land.>${prompt};
<To the nooorthwest of here is a place known as Kamihr. The land became deformed and rose ever higher, and is now covered in snow as bright white as the summeeer sun.>${prompt};
<Mother's suffeeering changed even the weather of Ulbuka itself.>${prompt};
<The scenes that played out in your mind are what happeeened in Rhazowa...and what happened here.>${prompt};
<Aaand now, Mother lies on the brink of death, with only the smallest fraction of energy left.>${prompt};
And what then? What if she were to pass on?${prompt};
<It would spell the eeend of us all.>${prompt};
<The grass, the trees, the birds, the beasts...they would all cease to eeexist.>${prompt};
<For you see, Ulbuka is not a laaand conducive to sustaining life.>${prompt};
<The changes in the foreeest are a manifestation of that phenomenon.>${prompt};
Do you have anything to say?;
${selection-lines};
How can we save the World Tree?${prompt};
<We do nooot know, sapling. Our connection to Mother is starting to splinter.>${prompt};
<The only seedliiing with an answer would be...>${prompt};
<...None other thaaan the king himself.>${prompt};
Your king? But where could we find him?${prompt};
<...>${prompt};
Wh-where are you going? Answer me!${prompt};
<Aaask...the king...>${prompt};

There exists no light without shadow. From shadow I come, and from shadow shall I be reborn!${prompt};
Ha...des, I...!;
Nothing happens.${prompt};
Teleportation protocols active. Proceed?;
${selection-lines};
No.;
Beam me up.${prompt};
So you have deigned to grace me with your presence.;
But...there appears to be nothing out of the ordinary.${prompt};
You undoubtedly have your hands full babysitting Arciela. I will remain here to make sure the area is safe.${prompt};
Oho! ${name-player}!${prompt};
So you have deigned to grace us with your presence.${prompt};
As puzzled as ever, I see.${prompt};
Our “suspicious man who can't possibly be a pioneer”? It is that oldster.${prompt};
Bwahaha! Yer exorcist friend's got quite the tongue!${prompt};
I've got a little story ta tell. It begins not long 'fer ya offed Hades.${prompt};
${choice: 2}[I've got a little story to tell. /]I'd been out tryin' ta investigate all the oddities that had been happenin' of late.${prompt};
And this place right here...well, it sets my senses tingling.${prompt};
It feels so cold...${prompt};
...and merciless!${prompt};
I'm gonna need yer help here, ${name-player}. I've tried apologizing ta her, but she just snorts and turns away.${prompt};
Scars on an old man like me are one thing, but could ya imagine a face as pretty as that with a gushin' axe wound? Hooo, boy.${prompt};
I have half a mind to take the haft of your axe and shove--${prompt};
What do you do?;
${selection-lines};
Take Morimar's side.;
Take Ingrid's side.${prompt};
${name-player}, I've got another axe haft with your name on it.${prompt};
Morimar, at least ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has the common decency not to raise ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] blade without looking.${prompt};
${choice: 2}[Hmph. Let/Now that we have settled that, let] me divest myself of this anger. It is wholly unbecoming.${prompt};
To hear this one tell it, Arciela owes him her very life.${prompt};
And the two of you have some sort of past, so... I have no choice but to accept that he is not quite as suspicious as that pig Gratzigg would claim.${prompt};
I know not by what divine reckoning he still lives, but one thing is clear--Arciela owes him her very life.${prompt};
And this ancient relic, well...he is not quite as suspicious as that pig Gratzigg would claim.${prompt};
...The dull chill of mercilessness descends once more...${prompt};
What of it? The drool on your chin speaks the truth--you have already forgotten that you intended to give me something for the good of the city and our princess.${prompt};
R-right. The mind's always the first ta go...${prompt};
Hearin' the way your ministers and maesters have been treatin' her, I'm inclined ta go give it myself and beat some sense inta them...but I know it'd just have the opposite effect.${prompt};
So I want ya to hand it over in my stead, ta prove ta 'em that the princess is fully in the right.${prompt};
Just 'cause the major threat is gone doesn't mean that Balamor won't pop his head up when we least expect it. I've gotta protect that forest and serve as the city's first line of defense.${prompt};
Maybe ya won't know how ta use it, but I'm sure it'll help the pioneering effort--or at least serve some other purpose.${prompt};
And just what is this?${prompt};
<Gasp>;
Yer one of them ladies who deals with purgations, so I'da thought you'd get it right away.${prompt};
Amazin' how back then one simple piece o' cloth could shake the world.${prompt};
Perhaps it'd help ya get rid of some of the nasties sometimes wanderin' about here. So go back ta the city and show 'em what ya found.${prompt};
There is no more for us to do in these Goddessforsaken woods...for now. Even that snout-faced Gratzigg at the Peacekeepers' Coalition will stop wallowing around in the mud when he sees this.${prompt};
But what could Morimar mean by “nasties sometimes wanderin' about here”...?${prompt};
Mommy...is that really you? But...why? Why now?${prompt};
Ingrid, I have no greater regret than having left you.${prompt};
Despite being afflicted by a terrible curse, I went to purge a dullahan from the weald...and lost half my spirit doing so.${prompt};
I returned to the forest to reclaim what was mine.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But without a whole spirit, I could not fully pass on to the next world.${prompt};
As I slept, I could think of nothing but you...of seeing your face just one more time.${prompt};
When the light that wrapped the land had ceased, I borrowed Faustoise's body, just so I could see you again.${prompt};
Mommy...${prompt};
I can only imagine how you have suffered these long years.${prompt};
I could have borne all the torment and ridicule they hurled were it directed solely at me, but you...you were completely without sin, yet bore the same cross as I.${prompt};
Hildebert...and this Faustoise...they conspired to expel you from the Order of Weatherspoon.${prompt};
Ingrid, you needn't hold it in any longer.${prompt};
Show them. Show them all what you've become.${prompt};
All those who go against you must learn. Your calling is to lead the exorcists and to create a new age all your own.${prompt};
Mommy? What are you talking about?${prompt};
Me? Ingrid, dear, I could ask you the same question.${prompt};
To think one always so high-handed and strong of will would be reduced to stooping to the ground like an old hag. Even your pioneer friend senses something is amiss.${prompt};
Wh-when did you get here!?${prompt};
${name-player}, if you are truly Ingrid's friend...${prompt};
Then you will support her as I cannot. The position of archexorcist should be hers, and hers alone. Tell her.${prompt};
What do you tell Ingrid?;
${selection-lines};
Alucia is right!;
Ingrid? What's your take?${prompt};
I never thought you held me in such high regard. I know I should feel happy, but...${prompt};
Of course, I believe in myself and what I can do, but...${prompt};
My powers cannot and will not be used for furthering my own ambition. They will be used to bring peace to Adoulin.${prompt};
I will not engender conflict in the city I love for my own personal gains.${prompt};
My mother was a kind, gentle woman, who always guided me down the right path.${prompt};
And you--you are not her! Show yourself, vile demon!${prompt};
Gwehehehe!;
Hahahaha!${prompt};
Oh, Ingrid. You are only half right.${prompt};
When Alucia was about to succeed in her purgation, I saw a weak link in her spiritual chain and seized a part of her soul.${prompt};
No! Mother was supposed to have vanquished you!${prompt};
It's true. I wonder what it would taste like to have the souls of both mother and daughter.${prompt};
You dare struggle? Should you best me, it would be killing your mother all over again.${prompt};
And what of Marcellurin? Could you look him in the eye as you lug his mother's battered corpse through the city gates?${prompt};
You moralless coward!${prompt};
The mark!${prompt};
...So that's what he meant!${prompt};
Graaaaaaoooooo!;
Grk...Blaaark...;
What is this...power!?${prompt};
${name-player}! This pains me much less than I thought, but I need your help! Don't worry about Mother...or me. We've got to stop him!${prompt};
Your mother...has succumbed to...the darkness. Hahahaha...!;
Faustoise!;
Faustoise? Faustoise!? What happened out here!?${prompt};
Ingrid!;
The slumber has taken hold of her once more...${prompt};
Hildebert...my love...;
How happy it makes me...to see your face.${prompt};
The slumber has taken hold of her once more...but I know she will recover eventually.${prompt};
We have bested the dullahan who took over her spirit.${prompt};
She will surely awaken once we have rid the land of this terrible curse.${prompt};
Ingrid...words cannot express my gratitude for what you have done for my mother.${prompt};
Ugh. Look at you, gushing like an ergon locus. Would it be too much to ask that you learn to be more stoic like your father?${prompt};
The ordeal has left her exhausted both in body and spirit, but she will be whole before long.${prompt};
Ingrid...words cannot express my gratitude for what you have done for my mother.${prompt};
Ugh. Look at you, gushing like an ergon locus. Would it be too much to ask that you learn to be more stoic like your father?${prompt};
Ingrid, I bid you come see me at the coalition when you have your affairs in order.${prompt};
You must be concerned with what comes next, and you doubtless have much to say to me.${prompt};
C'mon, men. Bring her back to the city.${prompt};
Thank the Goddess...${prompt};
Ingrid, what about your mother? Am I to understand that it was all a ploy by the dullahan?${prompt};
Exactly.;
But we can discuss this further at your father's manse. This place is not safe for you.${prompt};
I owe you as much of a debt as I do Ingrid. Not many would risk their lives for the mother of a stranger.${prompt};
I feel wholly drained. Despite Morimar's mark, undertaking a purgation ritual without due groundwork is a tiring affair.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Will you be fine?;
What about your mother's spirit?${prompt};
Yes. Although I mourn for the loss of my mother.${prompt};
It was dispersed to the winds, just like that dullahan.${prompt};
But there was no other choice--and I know that spirits are never truly destroyed. Given time, it will become part of a new life born into Vana'diel.${prompt};
I can rest easy knowing that I have released her from years of suffering.${prompt};
Her voice echoed in my mind as her spirit waned.${prompt};
She borrowed Faustoise to tell me...to tell me...${prompt};
“I have always been watching over you.”${prompt};
I am who I am today because she has been by my side all these years.${prompt};
Hmph. And there you sit upon your high horse, convinced it was my mercilessness that gave me my oomph.${prompt};
...Hahaha.;
${name-player}...thank you.${prompt};
I can handle the rest from here. Until we meet again.${prompt};
We shall see each other again soon.${prompt};

A...what?;
Father? Mother?;
...What are those?${prompt};
They're...in Adoulin?;
Haha...hahaha.${prompt};
I need...${item-plural: 0[2]}...;

Inquire about anything?;
${selection-lines};
No, thank you.;
Ask about Lorissa.;
Ask about ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Exchange ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Have ${item-plural: 0[2]} returned.${prompt};
Me?;
...I'm Lorissa.${prompt};
You...knew that already?${prompt};

Why?${prompt};
...${prompt};
I...don't know.${prompt};

${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...?${prompt};

I have...${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. How...how many do you want?${prompt};
I don't want to...but here.${prompt};
Oh...then I can keep them?${prompt};
I...don't have that many. Only ${number: 1}.${prompt};
Hahaha...I have so many! I can't hold any...more.${prompt};
