(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
${prompt};

TEST-No.${number: 1}${prompt};
I found ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};

Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...${prompt};
We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...${prompt};

What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;

Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};

Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;

Nothing.;
Conquests.;
Conquest results.;

Conquest points.;
The effects of controlling regions.;
Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};

Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt};

Well, far be it from me to chastise someone on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] first day. Still, as a citizen of San d'Oria, you--${prompt};
Ah, Avandale! What are you doing there?${prompt};
Prince Trion, I was explaining to this recruit here about what it means to be a proud citizen of San d'Oria!${prompt};
A new recruit? Strengthen your sword arm and your stature as a knight. Thus will you best serve the glory of our great kingdom.${prompt};
San d'Oria has more than enough soldiers already, brother. Speaking of which, should you not be training them, instead of bothering new recruits with talk of war?${prompt};
You are too bold!${prompt};
Really, Pieuje! Is that any way to speak to your brother?${prompt};
I've said the truth, nothing more. The ranks of our armies could swell to bursting, and victory would still be far.${prompt};
It is your head that is swollen, brother. With enough numbers, we could crush the beastmen! And without having to resort to your misguided tactics!${prompt};
My tactics, misguided? Oh, that is rich! Tell me of the tactics that lost an entire company in Batallia Downs the other day?${prompt};
It's good you're so fond of talking, as I've never seen you wield a sword! Better to shout orders from the rear than reveal your ineptitude in actual combat!${prompt};
Stop your quarreling, both of you!${prompt};
A divided leadership only creates unrest among the people, soldier and civilian alike. Surely you are both aware of this?${prompt};
Oh, I suppose. I warn you, Pieuje, talk to me that way again and I won't be so forgiving.${prompt};
Good old Trion. Threats of violence are his only recourse when a conversation does not go his way. Like a child, he is!${prompt};
They are both like children, quick to insult and quicker to take offense! Really...${prompt};
I must apologize for that. But ours is truly a great kingdom, and I expect you to further her glory.${prompt};
Those two are a handful, but they truly are the closest of brothers.${prompt};
Perhaps I could be of service. Is there anything in particular you'd like to know?${prompt};
Something you'd like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing, actually.;
I'd like to get out of the city.;
I'd like to do some shopping.;
Tell me more about adventuring.${prompt};
Just got here and you're aching to leave, eh? Listen, the lands are wild beyond our gates, filled with fiends and their ilk.${prompt};
But if you must go, take those stairs, head for Northern San d'Oria, then go out Ranperre Gate. You'll need to go down Laborman's Way, then take a right to get to the gate.${prompt};
If you need any help with directions, ask those around you. Our citizens are friendly, for the most part.${prompt};
Wait, wait! One more thing. If someone aids you, be sure to show them your gratitude. That is all.${prompt};
If you want to buy weapons or other supplies, just ask one of the merchants in town.${prompt};
Ahh, recruits... Don't know which way to hold a sword and you think you're ready for adventures. Well, what would you like to know?${prompt};
You need to go to the Novice's Hall. You'll find it in Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Hunting monsters.;
Making easy money.;
Working for my country.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Come to think of it, there was a lady in front of a house on Pikeman's Way. She may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Hmm, yes... Come to think of it, there was a lady just down those stairs. She may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Ahh, recruits... Don't know your own limits until a fiend beats it into your head for you. Very well. How about gathering some hides?${prompt};
From Northern San d'Oria, pass through Victory Arch to enter Southern San d'Oria. There you'll find the Tanners' Guild. They need hides every now and then.${prompt};
If you have trouble finding the Tanners' Guild, just ask around.${prompt};
Easy money, eh? Typical of a new recruit. I cannot promise ease, but try the lumberyard in Northern San d'Oria. Should be enough work for you there.${prompt};
Go up those stairs there to get to Northern San d'Oria. You'll find the lumberyard near the top.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice. Head to any city gate and inquire at the gatehouse. They'll give you work befitting your rank.${prompt};
Here, take this. It's ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Give it to Teilsa at the bottom of the staircast in Northern San d'Oria. She'll help you out.${prompt};
To give items to others, select “Trade” from the main menu. Don't you forget it!${prompt};
What? A pickpocket? Well, I did see a strange woman run to Northern San d'Oria. But I didn't see her steal anything.${prompt};
All right, then! I am ready to eat!${prompt};
Welcome. What'll it be?${prompt};
I clearly heard that the knights were planning a strike on those Ghelsba Orcs. Whatever came of that?${prompt};
Well, how could the two princes possibly organize a raid? They can't even agree on the color of the sky!${prompt};
Then, is it true that the first prince to quell the Orcs of Ghelsba will inherit the Kingdom?${prompt};
Bah. Simply taking Ghelsba won't make anybody king.${prompt};
Aye, but he'd be a step closer to the throne! Still, it must be in their blood to quarrel.${prompt};
It's been twenty years since the Great War, and the king is old. His little princes have grown into men, now...${prompt};
Yet I hear they bicker over which will be king. A sadder fate has never befell a kingdom, if it's true.${prompt};
Who knows? And they were such good brothers in their youth.${prompt};
Aye, 'tis true that San d'Oria joined Windurst, Bastok, and Jeuno in war twenty years ago. We slew the Shadow Lord, and drove back his hordes!${prompt};
I say “we,” but what did the absent-minded Windurstians and granite-licking Bastokers do? Nothing! And don't get me started on those upstart fishermen from Jeuno!${prompt};
Our knights triumphed against darkness that day. San d'Oria saved this world from the clutches of the Shadow Lord!${prompt};
Soon, our great kingdom will bring peace to this land! Fight with me, my brothers, until that glorious day has come!${prompt};
Egads, I'm hungry! I feel faint...${prompt};
Bring meat! Any meat, I say! I'm just back from a long march, and I hunger!${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, sir. We've run out of meat, you see--${prompt};
Out of meat! Well I...I guess there's no helping that now, is there? What else have you got?${prompt};
We...have the usual. I'll bring it right out.${prompt};
By Altana! Not beans again...${prompt};
I'm afraid so...${prompt};
Please! I've had naught but beans for weeks!${prompt};
And a belly full of beans doesn't satisfy.${prompt};
Hmm... If only I had five ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I could make something for him.${prompt};
By the Goddess, not beans again. Oh, anything...anything but beans.${prompt};
What? I didn't ask for this.${prompt};
Why, these are fine ${item-plural: 0[2]}! Hand them to the chef, friend, right away!${prompt};
What's this? I don't need this!${prompt};
Altana bless you! I can finally make my customers some ${item-plural: 0[2]}! Give me that meat, then, and I'll make sure you're paid.${prompt};
You receive a payment of 30 gil.${prompt};
Adventurer! You brought the meat, eh? I thank you from the bottom of my stomach!${prompt};
Let me share a tidbit of knowledge with you. It might come in handy.${prompt};
You know what they say about a good meal? Well, it's true that food can give you a real boost. Try a few dishes till you find what works for you.${prompt};
Tell you what, I'll give you a bit of this here. No, no, it's on me, really. I'd be eating beans if it weren't for you!${prompt};
Ah, but it seems you're carrying too much already. You come back when you've lightened your load.${prompt};
Go on, take it.${prompt};
What? Something wrong with my food?${prompt};
Welcome travelers! Come on in! Try the best beans in town!${prompt};
Try our famous bean cuisine, satisfaction guaranteed!${prompt};
You know... Our beans really need some ${item-plural: 0[2]}. It's the secret to our bean stew.${prompt};
Thing is, we're running short, and once we're out we'd lose our customers! You think you could bring ${number: 1} chunks?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not today.${prompt};
Thank you! You can find ${item-plural: 0[2]} from river crabs. But watch out for the pincers.${prompt};
Well that's too bad. If you find any, though, you know where to bring them!${prompt};
Remember, you can get ${item-plural: 0[2]} from river crabs!${prompt};
Yes! This should give our beans a bang! Here, this is for you.${prompt};
If you happen to find more, bring them by. I'll buy them off you in bunches of ${number: 1}.${prompt};
My! A real adventurer, here, talking to me!${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you not? Tell me, what's your mission rank?${prompt};
Well? Hmm... Even the longest journey begins with a single step, they say!${prompt};
Hey! Out of my way!${prompt};
Stop, thief!${prompt};
Uh-oh!${prompt};
I've been had! Stop that thief!${prompt};
Nobody can catch Esca the Swift! Haha!${prompt};
Confound it! She's getting away, but I can't abandon this post!${prompt};
Say, that man needs help! Why don't you help him? You are an adventurer, right?${prompt};
Hello there, I am Altiret. I'm here to catch things on the airship hulls: fiends, and worse.${prompt};
That's why they need port guards like me. Day and night we stand here. But hardship is naught to an Elvaan knight!${prompt};
You...saw her didn't you? The pickpocket?${prompt};
She copped my gold-rimmed glasses! They belonged to my wife. Please get them back!${prompt};
I cannot leave my post. Ach, what am I to do?${prompt};
Say, is this yours? It looks like a button... Maybe it fell off when that lady ran into you.${prompt};
It's not yours, huh? How odd... I'm sure it wasn't here a moment ago!${prompt};
Well, I'll give it to you anyway. Perhaps it will be of some use.${prompt};
Say, what's this doing here? Isn't this the button I gave you? You must have dropped it, silly!${prompt};
You're working hard, right? I think adventurers should battle in the field, not boast in the tavern!${prompt};
Say, did you drop something just now?${prompt};
It looks like a button... Whose could it be?${prompt};
Here, why don't you take it.${prompt};
I hope you can find whoever owns that button. It's awful pretty and all.${prompt};
Oh, you can't carry it? It's just a button! Why don't you get rid of some of those other things you're carrying first.${prompt};
What do you want? I'm busy, so make it quick.${prompt};
Me? A pickpocket!? Outrageous!${prompt};
Is this the way of adventurers today--to run up and accuse innocent ladies of foul crimes? With no proof at all, I might add!${prompt};
Who do you think you are, anyway?${prompt};
Look, I'll forget your little gaffe this once... No, on second thought, I'll forget ever having met you. Good day.${prompt};
What!? If you insist on playing the sheriff, I suggest you bring evidence!${prompt};
What's that? Say, that ${item-singular: 0[2]}, that's mine! I must have dropped it when I ran into you at the dock...${prompt};
Whoops, I've gone and said it now.${prompt};
Fine. Here's those stupid ${item-singular: 0[2]} back. Satisfied? Good. Now leave!${prompt};
Oooh! You've found them! My wife's ${item-singular: 0[2]}! Thank you, kind adventurer!${prompt};
Please accept this. Go ahead, it's yours.${prompt};
This isn't mine! I thank you, but you'd better keep it.${prompt};
What was stolen is now returned, and I didn't have to leave my post! Thanks again.${prompt};
Greetings, traveler!;
(Shop Menu)${prompt};
Ahhh, now I've gone and done it!${prompt};
Come, now! Why don't you just tell me what happened?${prompt};
I received a bond from a customer, a very important customer, mind you. And now I've lost it!${prompt};
I walked about so much yesterday, I could have dropped it anywhere.${prompt};
Well, go on! We can't help you unless you say where you went!${prompt};
Yesterday morning, I was at the South Auction House, then I went to the outpost in West Ronfaure. I met a trader there.${prompt};
I took him all the way to the La Theine Plateau. On the way back through West Ronfaure, I passed Knightwell. Then I came back to the city through the Westgate.${prompt};
Say, you don't think you could find that document for me, could you? I'd reward you, of course. What say you?${prompt};
There's a shortage of good adventurers, these days. I'll ask someone else, then.${prompt};
You'll go find it for me? That's a relief. You have my thanks, adventurer.${prompt};
Where could I have dropped it? Was it the South Auction House, or the outpost in West Ronfaure where I met the trader?${prompt};
Or maybe I dropped it when I escorted him to the La Theine Plateau... Or when I passed by Knightwell in West Ronfaure, or even near the Westgate!${prompt};
What? You've found it! The missing bond! My reputation is saved!${prompt};
Here, it is not much, but please accept this as my thanks. You have well earned it today!${prompt};
Thank you for finding that missing bond. Who knows what I would have done without it!${prompt};
Ah, what have we here, a new recruit? I am Fontoumant. Nothing comes in or out the Consortium's warehouses without me knowing about it.${prompt};
We get shipments from every land here. I can never hire enough workers to handle the load.${prompt};
Youngsters these days, they lack fortitude! They show up for work once or twice and they disappear. Like seabirds before a gale, they are. Leaving me holding the feathers!${prompt};
Ah, which reminds me. You wouldn't be needing work, would you? My gil is good, and there's much to be done.${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
I'll work.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
Ach, just like the yearlings I get everyday, you are. Not a strong back in the lot of you!${prompt};
Is there no one left that will do an honest day's work? It's piling up, you know.${prompt};
That's the spirit! There may be some hope for your generation, yet. Here, your first parcel!${prompt};
Mind you, if you lose it, I'll expect payment for the lost goods. That's my only rule.${prompt};
Hmm...seems you've a fondness for hauling things already! Clear out your inventory before you take on mine.${prompt};
I expect you to deliver a parcel before taking another. Everything in the proper order, please.${prompt};
Wait, you haven't lost the extremely important parcel I entrusted you with, have you?${prompt};
If you've lost it, you'll have to pay for the loss. Give me 100 gil then and we'll be even.${prompt};
Fine. Very well, I'll have to go apologize to Regine over at the Magicmart in person. Take more care, next time.${prompt};
Fine. Very well, I'll have to go apologize to Apstaule over at the auction house in person. Take more care, next time.${prompt};
Fine. Very well, I'll have to go apologize to Thierride over at the tavern in person. Take more care, next time.${prompt};
Your first parcel is for Regine's Magicmart.${prompt};
You'll find it at the end of a passage branching off from the east tunnel.${prompt};
Give the parcel to the shop owner, Miss Regine, if you would.${prompt};
Good day! I am Regine. How might I help you?${prompt};
（ショップ準備中）${prompt};
How may I help you?;
${selection-lines};
I forgot why I'm here.;
I want to buy magic.;
I'm looking for work.;
I'm out of flyers.${prompt};
There are two kinds of magic in the world: white that heals wounds, and black that makes them. Which do you choose?${prompt};
Which do you choose?;
${selection-lines};
White magic.;
Black magic.${prompt};
Now, that won't do. Come back when you remember what brought you here.${prompt};
You...${prompt};
...are a bit...${prompt};
...slow, aren't you?${prompt};
Well, I didn't take you for a courier! You look more like an adventurer, you know.${prompt};
It's hard to keep up with fashion these days. Let's have the parcel, then.${prompt};
Thank you for that. Drop in and do some shopping next time. Oh, and please give my regards to your manager.${prompt};
My, my, my! What's this? I'm flattered, but this is a business, you know.${prompt};
This should be easy. Your next parcel is for the auction house.${prompt};
Walk out that door over there, and it will be right in front of your nose. You can't miss it.${prompt};
Give the parcel to Apstaule, understood?${prompt};
Eh? A parcel? What's an adventurer like you doing deliveries for?${prompt};
I mean, anybody could do what you're doing. How come an adventurer... Ah, never mind. Give my regards to the chief!${prompt};
Huh? I didn't order this! Here, take it back.${prompt};
This is the auction house. Put your things up for sale here to get the best price.${prompt};
Finally! Your third parcel's for the pub.${prompt};
Go out the door below, turn left, and walk along the waterfront. You'll find the Rusty Anchor there.${prompt};
Deliver the parcel to a Mr. Thierride. And remember, you're on business!${prompt};
What's this? A parcel, for me?${prompt};
But you're an adventurer, are you not?${prompt};
There's got to be plenty of work for your type! Don't waste your time hauling parcels to and fro.${prompt};
This kingdom honors those who carry swords, not parcels, in case you hadn't noticed.${prompt};
Leave the package delivery to those with nothing better to do!${prompt};
You did well, ${name-player}. That should do it for now.${prompt};
You've done well. Here, take this.${prompt};
You cannot carry any more gil.${prompt};
Oh, Regine? Isn't there anything for me to do? We've only had one or two people in here all day...${prompt};
Patience, my good sister, patience. Some big spender is likely to come walking in that door any moment now... I hope.${prompt};
Every time I think we've got a real customer, all they want are ${item-plural: 0[2]}. I warned you against opening a magic shop in San d'Oria!${prompt};
But you're the one who said, “I don't want to move that far!” when I suggested we go to Windurst!${prompt};
Wait-- Did you hear that?${prompt};
M-maybe it's a customer! At last!${prompt};
Another pauper, surely.${prompt};
Mind your manners, Rugiette! A customer is a customer, don't forget! And straighten up, please!!${prompt};
Okay, okay! I'm standing, now, I'm standing.${prompt};
Ahem! Greetings, fair customer! H-how might we be of service today? Looking for something to buy, perhaps?${prompt};
（なに言ってんだか、もう……）${prompt};
ねぇ、アンタって冒険者なのよね？;
そこを見込んで、頼みがあるんだけどさ。;
よかったら、話だけでも聞いてくんないかな？${prompt};
話を聞く？;
${selection-lines};
聞いてみる;
やめておく${prompt};
For two years we have run this shop, but alas! Hardly a customer in all this time!${prompt};
We finally decided that perhaps our store is not in a good location.${prompt};
Were I a customer, I would never turn from the corridor up above, and come all the way down this dreary stairwell!${prompt};
Really! Hold your tongue when I speak with a customer, my dear, dear sister!${prompt};
As a matter of fact, I've a request for you.${prompt};
I need help passing out flyers for our Magicmart to people in town. I will pay you! Please, will you help?${prompt};
Pass out flyers?;
${selection-lines};
I'd love to.;
Not now, sorry.${prompt};
Here are the flyers, then. Please hand them to people on the streets of San d'Oria. Pass them all out, if you can!${prompt};
"Give them only to city folk; adventurers seem to find our place without help, and I wouldn't want to waste flyers.${prompt}";
Thank you! Come back when you've passed out all fifteen flyers. I'll pay you then!${prompt};
As you wish. But come back if you have a change of heart.${prompt};
Oh dear, you seem to be carrying too much all ready. Come back when you've lightened your load.${prompt};
You've lost the flyers? Paper and ink are not free, you know. I'll give you one flyer for ${number: 7} gil. Just “Trade” the money to me.${prompt};
This person isn't interested.${prompt};
This person already has a flyer.${prompt};
Your flyer is accepted!${prompt};
You've handed out ${number: 0} flyer(s).${prompt};
You've handed out all the flyers? Simply amazing! Here's your money, then, as promised!${prompt};
I do hope everyone reads those flyers...${prompt};
Our business is much improved, thank to you! You will always be welcome here in Regine's Magicmart!${prompt};
Hmm... You don't look like the riffraff we get around here. No wet-behind-the-ears recruit, are you?${prompt};
I be Vounebariont, brewer of potions and medicines.${prompt};
I've been waiting here a good long time now for a shipment, ingredients for me potions, you see. But it's not arrived!${prompt};
I don't suppose you could be persuaded to fetch five beetle shells from Jugner Forest, now, could you?${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, some call 'em “coleoptera shells.” They're a rare but vital ingredient in potions.${prompt};
If you'd be so kind as to bring me five of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}, I'd pay you handsomely, or my name's not Vounebariont!${prompt};
You're back, and with the shells as requested! Here's your payment then, like I promised you.${prompt};
Should the mood strike you, I'm willing to buy more ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Bring five, and we'll do business.${prompt};
What's this, eh? I don't recall ever asking for this! Take it away.${prompt};
How fare you? You get five ${item-plural: 0[2]} yet? When you do, bring 'em by and we'll talk.${prompt};
"Hello there, again. Say, bring me five more of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}; I always need more for me potions.${prompt}";
I dare say that our two princes bicker over which is to inherit the throne.${prompt};
The elder's a warrior, the younger a thinker, and neither bows to the other. The two knightly orders' loyalties are split between them...${prompt};
With such intrigue inside our walls, beastmen roam the countryside. And there's precious little we can do about it!${prompt};
A pickpocket, eh? Well, I can see a lot from up here, but the only shady character I've noticed is that bloke by the cargo room, there.${prompt};
Pay ${number: 0} gil and leave San d'Oria?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Ticket, please.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} is required to go beyond this door.${prompt};
I'm terribly sorry, but you don't have enough money. You will need ${number: 0} gil. Please come again.${prompt};
That's ${number: 0} gil. Please go ahead.${prompt};
This is San d'Oria Customs. We must check the belongings of all who enter our kingdom. Thank you.${prompt};
Carriers of restricted items must sell them at the stall over there, or dispose of them before exiting. Thank you.${prompt};
Please beware that smuggling contraband into San d'Oria is a serious offense. Thank you.${prompt};
All passengers, please present your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} at the door.${prompt};
This is the exit. Please find the entrance to the air travel agency to your left.${prompt};
Welcome to the Kingdom of San d'Oria. Before entering the city, please see the customs officer at the counter.${prompt};
If you would rather board the airship, please return to the docks and await the next flight.${prompt};
Welcome to the Kingdom of San d'Oria. The door ahead will take you into the city.${prompt};
Please be advised that if you wish to board an airship after exiting, you will have to pay your fare again.${prompt};
Enter the city?;
${selection-lines};
Right away.;
Not now.${prompt};
Welcome to the air travel agency. Passengers wishing to embark may purchase tickets here.${prompt};
こちらは飛空旅行社入口です。;
チケットのお求めには、飛空艇パスが必要と;
なります。${prompt};
This is the auction house.${prompt};
A pickpocket? No one like that around here.${prompt};
Welcome to the auction house. If you've something to auction, see one of the service windows on either side.${prompt};
This is the auction house. Sellers set a minimum price for their goods, and buyers make bids on the items they want.${prompt};
If the buyer's bid is above the seller's asking price, the deal goes through!${prompt};
Have I seen anyone suspicious? No, not around here. Sorry!${prompt};
The Shadow Lord turned the beastmen into fierce opponents in the Great War twenty years ago.${prompt};
Alas, what a terrible sight they were! I still shiver just thinking of them!${prompt};
If heroes hadn't come forth to stop the Shadow Lord...who knows what would have become of this world!${prompt};
Beyond lies the residential area.${prompt};
The airship docks are down this corridor. Not that they'd let a two-gil guard and a starry-eyed adventurer on one of those airships, eh?${prompt};
But they cannot hold us back! Work hard, and our day will come. We shall ride that airship together!${prompt};
A pickpocket? No, not round here.${prompt};
This corridor leads to an auction house. Prince Pieuje ordered their construction. But if you ask me, such places do not become our grand city.${prompt};
A proud Elvaan would not peddle wares like some Hume merchant... How times have changed!${prompt};
But if you must go, the far corridor there leads to the residential area. After all, even knights must rest!${prompt};
Hmm? Someone suspicious? Now that you mention it, I did see a woman dart up the western stair, that way.${prompt};
Below these stairs lies the auction house. Some may grumble about proud San d'Orians reduced to squabbling merchants, but I care not.${prompt};
In fact, I agree with Prince Pieuje. The Kingdom must welcome change, before the rest of the world passes her by.${prompt};
A pickpocket? Now there's a scoundrel unworthy of San d'Oria! It wasn't an Elvaan, was it?${prompt};
This passage leads to the airship docks. There's a magic shop if you take the corridor on the right there.${prompt};
Magic is the specialty of the Federation of Windurst, of course. We have some, but for true sorcery you have to search there.${prompt};
Aye, pickpockets will get you if you don't watch yourself.${prompt};
Ahead lies the port, where airships are laden with goods for Jeuno. You'll find an auction house and the residential area, too.${prompt};
The Brugaire Consortium owns the cargo rooms there. They're on good terms with Monarlais Halver and the papsque, I hear.${prompt};
A pickpocket? Things sure have gotten rough around here. You watch yourself.${prompt};
Take this corridor if you're heading to Northern San d'Oria or Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
She went down this corridor! Get that rapscallion, quick!${prompt};
"Take a left to find the magic shop. Keep going straight for the residential area. Oh, and take care not to upset Regine; she's scary when she's mad!${prompt}";
Hey, that pickpocket just ran that way! Get after her, quick!${prompt};
Up ahead are the airship docks. The Grand Duchy of Jeuno runs all the airships, you know.${prompt};
Only those of good standing, or deep pockets, are allowed onboard. I can't see why you'd want to go there.${prompt};
The residential area is up these stairs. If you ask me, San d'Orians must cast aside the trappings of wealth.${prompt};
It's not knightly to sit on cushioned couches in gilt halls! No, we should sleep with the grass as our pillow, the dew our morning gown.${prompt};
Yet our kingdom supplies those fool Mog Houses for all! Moogles, or whatever they call those demons, have no place in a proper San d'Orian home. ${prompt};
I'd like to just to take a moogle and-- Ah, pardon me, I was lost in thought. No, I haven't seen anyone suspicious.${prompt};
The auction house is down this corridor.${prompt};
The airport docks are at the end of this corridor.${prompt};
この先は北サンドリアの工業地帯だ。${prompt};
あやしい者？　ここは通行量が多いから;
誰かあやしい者、と言われても……　うーむ。${prompt};
ああ、困ったわ！;
どうしましょう……。${prompt};
ああ、困ったわ！　どうしましょう。;
うちの主人はロンフォールの森の警備を;
しているのですが、今日はいつも持って出る;
塗り薬を忘れて、出かけてしまったのです。${prompt};
危険な仕事なので、いつ薬が必要に;
なるかわかりません。;
お願いです。もしよろしければ、この薬を主人に;
届けてもらえませんでしょうか？${prompt};
自分ですぐにも持っていってあげたい;
ところですが、私にも城内での務めがあるため;
外へ出られないのです。${prompt};
Do you accept?;
${selection-lines};
I suppose.;
No, I must refuse.${prompt};
ありがとうございます！！;
主人の名はアーベリオン(Aaveleon)と言います。${prompt};
街の外を巡回していると思いますので;
どうかよろしくお願いします。${prompt};
『手作りの軟膏』を渡された。${prompt};
そうですか……。${prompt};
これは、いただくわけにいきません。;
お返ししておきますね。${prompt};
あら、持ち物が;
いっぱいだったのですね？　無理を言って;
ごめんなさい。${prompt};
物が持てるようになったら;
またここに来て下さいね。${prompt};
うちの主人は;
見当たりませんでしたか？${prompt};
名前は、;
アーベリオン(Aaveleon)です。どうか軟膏を;
届けてやって下さい。${prompt};
本当にありがとうございました。;
魔物が増えたせいで、主人の傷も絶えません。;
まったく住みにくくなったものです。${prompt};
これは、ほんのお礼です。;
遠慮しないで、持っていってください。${prompt};
50ギルを手に入れた。${prompt};
『ムカデの黒焼き』をもらった。${prompt};
先程はありがとうございました。${prompt};
I am Hanaa Punaa, an apprrrentice at the Tanners' Guild.${prompt};
I drrream of becoming a full-fledged tanner, but it's not easy finding suitable tasks.${prompt};
Greetings!;
How may I help you today?${prompt};
Oh, it's you again!${prompt};
Something you need?;
${selection-lines};
Do you have any work for me?;
No, nothing.${prompt};
If you'd like to do some shopping, see the clerk inside the store.${prompt};
Work? Ah, perrrfect! I've just run out of skins, perrrhaps you could collect some for me?${prompt};
If you could collect three sheepskins from the sheep in the West Ronfaure woods, I'll make a garment for you.${prompt};
Well? Will you collect the skins?${prompt};
Oh, I see. Well, if you change your mind, come any time.${prompt};
Perrrfect! I'll be waiting for those three sheepskins, then. I can start as soon as you bring them!${prompt};
What about the sheepskins? I'll need three of them before I can make anything for you, sorry...${prompt};
なかなか新鮮な皮を持ってきたわね。;
おいしそうなニオイ……じゃなくて、;
これなら、いい装備品ができるわよ。${prompt};
ちょっと待ってて。;
お礼に装備品を1つ作ってあげるから。${prompt};
お待たせ。;
なかなかいいのができたわよ。遠慮せずに;
持って帰ってね。${prompt};
これさえ着けてれば、;
偉そうな門番にも文句は言われないわよ。;
堂々とお城に行ってらっしゃい。${prompt};
いらっしゃい。冒険者の人かね。;
何かうまいものでも食べてくかい？${prompt};
あんたに頼みがあるんだ。;
聞いての通り、最近はやたら魔物が多くてね、;
おいそれと外には出られなくなっちまった。${prompt};
あんた、冒険者かね？${prompt};
わしは、北サンドリアで宿屋を営む;
アボールという者だ。${prompt};
実は、夕食の材料にする野菜を;
切らしてしまい、困っとるのだよ。${prompt};
ロンフォールの森、南端の塔に行けば;
仲買人から野菜を分けてもらえるのだが……。;
どうだ、あんた、ひとつ頼まれてくれんかな。${prompt};
もちろん、タダでとは言わん。;
礼ははずむから、塔へ行って「バタリア菜」を;
仕入れてきてもらえんか？${prompt};
Do you accept?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not right now.${prompt};
そうか……、そいつは残念だ。${prompt};
おお、引き受けてくれるか？;
では、この注文書を、森の南側の塔にいる;
仲買人のフェレ(Phairet)に渡してくれ。${prompt};
支払いは後でまとめてするから、;
あんたは荷を受け取ってきさえすればいい。${prompt};
仲買人の居場所は、;
ロンフォールの森、南端の塔だ。バタリア菜の;
仕入れ、よろしく頼んだぞ。${prompt};
……と思ったが、;
持ち物がいっぱいのようだな。要らないものを;
処分してから、また来てくれ。${prompt};
おお、いいバタリア菜を持ってきたな。;
助かった、これで客に出すスープが作れるぞ。${prompt};
これは、ほんのお礼だ。;
遠慮なく受け取ってくれ。${prompt};
100ギル　を受け取った。${prompt};
やあ、あんたかい。;
こないだは助かったよ、ありがとう。${prompt};
何だ、こりゃ？;
急にこんなものを持ってこられても困る。;
わしには、必要ないな。${prompt};
やあ、いらっしゃい。${prompt};
おじさん、こんにちは！${prompt};
おお、カタリーナちゃんか。;
毎度どうも。酒場の方の景気はどうだい？${prompt};
今日は天気がいいせいか、;
アクアムスルムがたくさん売れちゃって。;
大急ぎで1樽、持ってきて欲しいんだけど。${prompt};
アクアムスルムを1樽だな？;
ちょっと待っててくれよ。${prompt};
こりゃ参ったな……;
昨日おたくに持って行ったのが、最後だった;
みたいだな。${prompt};
わかったわ、おじさん。;
それじゃ私は一旦お店に戻るから、大急ぎで;
追加オーダー、お願いね！${prompt};
アクアムスルムを1樽か……。;
ちょうど蜂蜜、切らしちまってるんだよな。;
手伝いのヤツは、先週ゲルスバでケガして;
しばらくは休むっていうし……${prompt};
よし、誰かウデの立つ者にでも、;
蜂蜜狩りを頼むことにするか。${prompt};
あんた、冒険者だろ？;
もし良かったら『蜂蜜』を5個ばかり;
取ってきてくれないか？　礼は、はずむぞ。${prompt};
そうか、仕方ないな……。;
じゃあ、誰か他の者でも探すとするか。${prompt};
アクアムスルムを1樽か……。;
ちょうど蜂蜜、切らしちまってるんだよな。;
手伝いのヤツは、先週ゲルスバでケガして;
しばらくは休むっていうし……${prompt};
と……、うん？　あんた、冒険者かい？;
ちょうどいいや、よかったら蜂蜜を集めて;
きてくれないかな？　人手不足でさ、頼むよ。${prompt};
ありがたい、引き受けてくれるか！;
それじゃあ、蜂蜜、5つばかり集めてきて;
くれ。頼んだよ！${prompt};
やあ、取ってきてくれたか！;
ありがとう、助かったよ。さあ、こいつは;
約束の礼だ。取っといてくれ。${prompt};
うーん、まだ足りないかな……。;
なあ、あんた、すまないが、もうちょっと集めて;
きてくれないかな？${prompt};
やあ、蜂蜜狩りに行ってくれるのか？${prompt};
こりゃありがたい。;
ラテーヌ高原に、いいハチが沢山いるんだよ。${prompt};
そうそう、蜂蜜は身体にいいからな。;
ちょっと元気が無い時なんかに飲めば、たちまち;
元気も出てくるってもんさ。${prompt};
だがハチの奴らは、毒を持っているし;
集団で襲ってくる可能性もあるから、充分に;
注意して、行ってきてくれよな。${prompt};
へへ、いいこと教えてやろうかー。;
ラテーヌ高原にいるハチのミツは、;
サイコーなんだよ！${prompt};
サンドリアのハチミツ博士と言われる;
ボクが言うんだから、まあ、まちがいないね。;
ひとなめで、もうメロメロ、キュ～さ！${prompt};
でも、ハチのヤツら、毒もってるし、;
群れでおそってくることもあるから、じゅーぶん;
気をつけたほうがいいよ。${prompt};
おお、いい蜂蜜が取れたようだな。;
これだけあれば、アクアムスルムを1樽は;
作れるな。ありがとうよ。${prompt};
取ってきてくれたお礼に;
アクアムスルムを1瓶やろう。${prompt};
あれ、まだ蜂蜜は取れないのかい？;
今日中に5個集まれば、何とかなりそうなんだが;
なぁ……${prompt};
なんだ？;
こんなものを頼んだ覚えはないな。さっさと;
持って帰ってくれ。${prompt};
こないだはありがとうな。${prompt};
仕事かぁ……。;
じゃあ、また、皮集めにでも行ってきて;
もらおうかなぁ。${prompt};
キーナス海岸にいる、;
海リザードの皮を3枚持ってきてくれたら、;
革のヨロイを1着、作ってあげてもいいわよ。${prompt};
あら、残念ね。;
海リザードの皮で作ったヨロイは、希少価値が;
高いってこと、知ってる？${prompt};
じゃ、頼んだわね。;
海リザードの皮を3枚持って来たら、;
革のヨロイを作ってあげるから頑張ってね。${prompt};
あら、海リザードの皮は？;
3枚集まらないと、革のヨロイは作ってあげない;
から、そのつもりでね。${prompt};
持ってきたわね？;
あなた、いつもいい皮を持ってくるわね。;
うちの専属ハンターになってもらおうかな？${prompt};
ウフフ……冗談よ。;
きっと、他にやることが沢山あるんでしょ？;
じゃ、ヨロイを作るからちょっと待ってて。${prompt};
お待たせ！;
うーん、やっぱりいい皮を使うと、ヨロイの;
出来映えが違うわね。${prompt};
海リザードの皮で作ったヨロイは;
水属性の攻撃に対する耐性が強いから、水際の;
敵に対しては有利に働くわよ。${prompt};
また、気が向いたら来るといいわ。${prompt};

Your business?;
${selection-lines};
A mission, please.;
Nothing, sorry.${prompt};
Hmm...not much work for one as wet behind the ears as you, but...${prompt};
How about Orc patrol? Only the yellowest of yearlings would run from that, and we've no work for cowards here.${prompt};
If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.;
Well then?${prompt};
Ask for details?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Here's your mission, then.;
You're to fight Orcs in the areas around here, and bring me one of their axes as proof.${prompt};
If you bring me an Orcish Axe without incident, you'll receive a reward as dictated by the laws of the Kingdom of San d'Oria.${prompt};
That is all.;
You'll take the mission then?${prompt};
Accept mission？;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
Could you explain again?;
No thank you, sir.${prompt};
Bring me one of those axes, and I'll consider the mission a success.;
"No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}";
Made it back in one piece? Good.;
A soldier who can't beat an Orc or two is no soldier of San d'Oria!${prompt};
Let's see that axe, then. I can't consider the mission complete without proof.${prompt};
Mission complete.;
Not bad, for a new recruit.;
Here's your reward, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
What's this? I don't recall asking you for one of these!;
Take it back.${prompt};
Where are we getting these new recruits!?${prompt};
Listen, before you bring me an item, you must first accept a mission!;
These are our country's rules, and I'll see you mind them.${prompt};
Persistent, aren't you?;
Mind you that one Orc under the belt does not a hero make!;
Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt};
Bat patrol! How about it?;
Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself!${prompt};
Here's your mission, then.;
You're to rid King Ranperre's Tomb of the bats that lurk there and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt};
If you bring me a Bat Fang without incident, you'll receive a reward as dictated by the laws of the Kingdom of San d'Oria.${prompt};
Once you get a Bat Fang, bring it back to me and I'll consider the mission a success.;
Oh, and watch out for those skeletons!${prompt};
Ah, you've returned!;
I feared those skeletons had gotten a hold of you, I did.${prompt};
So, you've brought me something back from the bats? I'll need that as proof.${prompt};
Mission complete.;
Not bad, for a new recruit.、;
Here's your reward, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, the new recruit's back again?;
I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt};
Still here? Well, perhaps you can be of some help.;
There's been a plague of kidnappings of late, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt};
Normally, the Royal Knights of San d'Oria would be on the job already,;
but the two princes that give the orders are at odds.${prompt};
Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt};
While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt};
They've been arguing this back and forth for days.;
The Knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt};
If you really want to make a name for yourself as an adventurer, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt};
What think you? Will you go?${prompt};
Here's your mission, then.;
You are to rescue the two children that have been kidnapped bye the Orcs of the;
Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt};
The Ghelsba Outpost is to the northwest of West Ronfaure.;
Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the outpost entrance up in the hills.${prompt};
Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check the huts first.${prompt};
Ah, you've returned!;
You were gone so long, I feared you'd been had for dinner!${prompt};
You may be of truer mettle than I thought.;
Mission complete!${prompt};
Here's your reward, ${item-singular: 2[2]}.;
And to further recognize your accomplishment...${prompt};
I hereby acknowledge you, ${name-player}, as a true Adventurer of San d'Oria!;
You're now mission rank 2, as well.${prompt};
But don't get too excited.;
Your title only holds clout here in the Kingdom of San d'Oria, understand?${prompt};
In order to become a true Adventurer and bear the Adventurer's Badge, you must be acknowledged as such by the countries of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt};
'Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law.;
I know it's a pain, but those are the rules.${prompt};
For now, I'd recommend you cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt};
Client sent server a bad value!${prompt};
ここは飛空艇発着場。;
もっとも、次の飛空艇がいつ到着するかは、;
誰にもわからないがな。${prompt};
Airships fly between our kingdom and the Grand Duchy of Jeuno to the east. I'll never forget the first day I saw one of those ships fly...${prompt};
Jeuno's history is short, but quickly did that village of Hume fishermen grow into what it is today.${prompt};
When their archduke came to power, he excavated the ruins nearby. The knowledge they found there made them as mighty as San d'Oria, by any reckoning.${prompt};
But once a fisherman, always a fisherman, I say. 'Tis the Elvaan of San d'Oria that will rule Vana'diel, mark my words!${prompt};

${selection-lines};
知っている;
知らない${prompt};
そうか。;
知っているのなら、特に話すことはない。${prompt};
では、教えてやろう。;
今から20年前、以前から対立していた、;
人間と獣人たちとの間に戦いが勃発した。${prompt};
その戦いは、;
クリスタル大戦と呼ばれ、その後、ながく続く;
ことになる。${prompt};
闇の王率いる、獣人たちの;
強大な力に対抗するため、ジュノが調停役となり;
3国は連合軍を結成して挑んだのだ。${prompt};
開戦から2年後、;
人類連合軍は辛くも勝利をおさめたのだ。${prompt};
獣人たちを率いていた;
闇の王は滅び、その居城と共に封印された……、;
という話だ。${prompt};
I've been hearing troubling things, lately. The beastmen are rising again, they say.${prompt};
It's not true, is it? I couldn't bear another war like twenty years ago. Those were dark times for all of Vana'diel.${prompt};
I'm scared... I'm very scared. My husband, my children, my friends...all the people I've come to know these twenty years. I will not lose them to another war!${prompt};
Heard the whispers, have you? The beastmen have a new leader. War is preparing!${prompt};
Ah, but any horde of beastmen will break upon these walls like water. Long live King Destin!${prompt};
Long live King Destin! Huh? Pickpockets? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here?${prompt};
Orcs have been harassing us ever since they took West Ronfaure. Confound those beastmen!${prompt};
But where are the knights? They should have stomped their camps flat months ago, just like in the Great War.${prompt};
Confound them! Give me a sword and... Eh? A pickpocket? Do I look like I hang out with that sort?${prompt};
ここは立入禁止だ。;
わかったら、さっさと向こうへ行け。${prompt};
Well, well... A new recruit! I was once an adventurer myself. Mind you, that was a long time ago...${prompt};
Aye, there hasn't been a war since the beastmen rose twenty years ago. I tried to settle down, and sold off my armor for some city clothes.${prompt};
But this son of adventurers couldn't give up his heritage for steady work. Not for lack of trying, mind you!${prompt};
Always got into fights with superiors, or quit at the first hint of boredom. Come to think of it, I've gotten nowhere, have I?${prompt};
I won't complain, but San d'Oria's days of glory are gone forever.${prompt};
Our days of glory are gone forever.${prompt};
A Tenshodo member, are you? Say, if you're interested, I've got something that needs doing. Might be worth a listen, at least.${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
Hear what he has to say.;
Not now.${prompt};
I see, I see. Well, to each ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own. You come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
That's the spirit! Now to business. I've got something I want you to take to the Tenshodo in Jeuno. ${prompt};
There's a bit of a story behind this one... But nothing that need concern you! You just take it to the Tenshodo for me.${prompt};
I'd bring it by foot, if I wasn't so sure it'd get broken. Airship's the way to go... But then there's customs to deal with.${prompt};
You'll get it through, won't you? If they catch you, they'll only confiscate the goods and keep you from flying for a while. No worries! I'll pay good, I will.${prompt};
All you have to do is deliver some goods by airship to the Tenshodo in Jeuno.${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
Let's do it.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
That's what I like to hear! Just hop on the airship to Jeuno, and make sure this gets to Yin Pocanakhu at the Tenshodo there.${prompt};
And it might be best to wait until nightfall.${prompt};
You're doing yourself a disservice, not taking this job, you know. Come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
Just make the delivery to Yin Pocanakhu at the Tenshodo in Jeuno. Don't worry! If you're caught, they'll just suspend your Jeuno flight privileges a short while.${prompt};
But if you're still a touch worried, you might consider waiting until nightfall.${prompt};
"You made it! You're a lucky one, then; they always seem to catch me. Oh, and your money, as promised!${prompt}";
Eh, they caught you? Ah, just a stripe of bad luck, that's all. This business is like rolling dice.${prompt};
Sorry to put you in a fix, eh? But don't let it get you down! There's always next time!${prompt};
What? Damaged it, did you? Pay attention when I talk to you! Take it on the airship next time!${prompt};
I'll ask you again once you get your flight privileges back in Jeuno. Best lay low for now.${prompt};
What's this? A magic shop? Hmm...I could use a new line of work, and magic just might be the ticket!${prompt};
I heard that the Brugaire Consortium that runs these warehouses is looking for workers.${prompt};
They're one of San d'Oria's biggest trading companies...but I hear they're a little rough with their staff.${prompt};
And people say they smuggl--ahem! Wouldn't want a prospective employer to hear me saying that, now would I!${prompt};
What? A pickpocket? Hey! I may be a loafer, but I'm no thief!${prompt};
Are you confident in your faith? Somewhere out there lies the gate to eternal paradise.${prompt};
We are children of the Goddess of the Dawn. She is the mother of all living things, and Vana'diel is her cradle.${prompt};
I am Teilsa, one of the faithful. Ever do I seek the way to Paradise.${prompt};
If you lose your way, choose “Map” from your main menu. Here, let me give you this in exchange for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Blessed are the believers. Always are we bathed in the light of the Goddess, and soothing is the sound of her song.${prompt};
Blessed are the believers, for spared are we her pain and sorrow. Her cold blade will never touch us.${prompt};
Soon you will see. Shadows of chaos will fall upon Vana'diel, and herald the coming of Crystal Warriors.${prompt};
The Goddess of the Dawn spoke: “He who fails to question his faith is blind. A believer without doubt will turn gold to lead.”${prompt};
"“I can only light thy candle; thou must carry thy own.”${prompt}";
“I cannot lead thee, for thy path is thine alone. Let the light of thy candle guide thee.”${prompt};
“He who finds me at the journey's end...” That is all. No one knows what follows.${prompt};
But the day will come when all is revealed.${prompt};
Behold San d'Oria, city of legends! I've always wanted to come here and join a proud order of knights.${prompt};
They don't let raw recruits into the chateau, but no matter! I'll complete so many missions they'll make me a certified adventurer in no time!${prompt};
But first, I'll warm up on a few of those worms outside the city gates! You have to walk before you can fly, my friend.${prompt};
A magic shop? Oh, it's right near here. I'll go check it out sometime.${prompt};
A pickpocket!? Whew, my wallet's safe. It takes money to be an adventurer!${prompt};
I've told Fontoumant, so all you have to do is deliver the goods to Avandale as...${prompt};
Hey! There're some things best left unheard, stranger. I trust you'll be leaving... Now!${prompt};
Come on, man, I think we're a little over our heads here! Someone big over in Jeuno gave that to commemorate...${prompt};
H-hey! Who are you? I don't know what you heard, but this is Brugaire Consortium business! Top secret. Get lost.${prompt};
Hey! I may be a child, but I am the captain of the Royal Knights Youth Division!${prompt};
My troops...well, it's just me and my brother, but Orcs shiver at our name! It's true!${prompt};
Hey! Salute when you speak to me! I am second captain of the Royal Knights Youth Division! Don't make me use my nirvana slash on you!${prompt};
Maybe we could use you. You'd be just a private...but there is plenty of opportunity for advancement.${prompt};
My grandpa always said that only a thief would take other people's things! If I find that pickpocket... Wham! Wham!${prompt};
My grandpa always said that the only stuff thieves take are other people's things! If I find that pickpocket, he's chocobo-feed!${prompt};
Hmph. A new recruit, are you? Let me give you some advice. There's Orcs outside our walls, more now than ever.${prompt};
Best not to face them before you're ready. They're known to attack without warning... Nasty things!${prompt};
Heh. Fighting is good, but discretion is the better part of valor! Run back to the gates if you need to.${prompt};
That's called a strategic retreat, that is!${prompt};
Yeah, a tradegic stretreat!${prompt};
I'll never forget the Great War of twenty years ago. The kindred of the Shadow Lord... So many lives lost... My sons... Oh, my sons!${prompt};
I'll not let it happen again! Not while blood still flows through my veins!${prompt};
Every morning I pray to Altana. Please, I say, please let these days of peace go on, till that day when we can all laugh and say, “Life is grand...life is beautiful!”${prompt};
It seems everyone is worried about the Orcs these days. Something's going on, that's for certain!${prompt};
It's about time we marched on their camps, I say. We've put up with those Orcs long enough! We Elvaan must put them back in their place.${prompt};
I heard the Orcish camp in West Ronfaure is called Ghelsba. There are so many of them these days!${prompt};
And I've heard they kidnap people! It's horrible, just horrible.${prompt};
This is the first I've heard of a magic shop here in San d'Oria. Such arts have never been popular in the Kingdom.${prompt};
I am Maunadolace of the Temple Knights, on orders from the prince to watch the auction house. I would love to chat, but I'm on duty.${prompt};
A fine chocobo, is she not? My tried and true companion, mine since she was but a chick.${prompt};
Admittedly, I'd rather be out in the field, doing battle with fiends, not standing here monitoring...commerce.${prompt};
A pickpocket? I would have detained anyone suspicious coming this way.${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh... Don't tell anyone, but I found me a wallet! I'm lucky, I tell you, real lucky!${prompt};
Finders keepers, finders keepers. Wonder what's inside! Nah, I'll look later.${prompt};
What have I got here? Look, I can't read, but I takes what I gets, and you ain't getting it back!${prompt};
Sorry, but we're currently unable to issue World Passes.${prompt};
Here we issue World Passes, with which you can invite others to play in the same world as you.${prompt};
Your World Pass is ${entity: 0}. Be sure to tell your friends!${prompt};
Take care, now. You can only invite a limited number of people with your World Pass.${prompt};
It's locked.${prompt};

Me name's Gallijaux, and I'd take fishing over food and drink any day. This here's my little brother, Joulet. He's a bit of an angler, too.${prompt};
Truth be told, that's a matter of great contention between us. We've competed to see who's the better fisherman before, but could never agree on the results, you see.${prompt};
So we got to thinking that we should instead ask others to fish for us, and see who finds the better fisherman! How about it? Will you help?${prompt};
Help Gallijaux?;
${selection-lines};
Help out.;
Refuse.${prompt};
I knew you were the type! That's great. Now, I want you to bring me either ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]}. Simple, eh?${prompt};
I won't ask how you get them, just bring them to me--the more the merrier, eh? And don't you worry, I always put me gil where me mouth is.${prompt};
Ah, now that's a shame. Should you change your mind, you know where to find me. Just don't let me catch you helping out me brother, now!${prompt};
How's it going with you? I've got ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[carp/carps] now--don't let me down!${prompt};
Ah, look at what you've brought me. This'll do fine, it will. Bring more!${prompt};
Hey, hey...;
I appreciate your generosity, but I certainly didn't ask for nothing like this!${prompt};
What's this? You're helping me brother, are you? Be gone with you, then! Out of my sight!${prompt};
Well now, it seems that you've brought me more than 10,000 carps! That's worth a reward to certify your accomplishment, methinks! You keep up the good work.${prompt};
Good day. I am Joulet, and Gallijaux is my elder brother. Our mother likes to say we were born with fishing rods in our hands.${prompt};
We've always wondered who was the better angler...but never could agree on the results of our contests, no matter how many times we tried.${prompt};
So we had the idea to make some friends, and invite them to fish, too, then compare who found the better fisherman. Might you be willing to help me out?${prompt};
Help Joulet?;
${selection-lines};
Help out.;
Refuse.${prompt};
Indeed? Splendid! Then listen--the two kinds of fish I want you to bring me are ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}. That shouldn't be too hard, should it?${prompt};
You can get the fish however you like, just bring them to me when you do. And the more you can bring, the better! I'll reimburse you, of course.${prompt};
That's a shame. Do come back if you should change your mind. Just...don't help my brother, please.${prompt};
How goes it? I've got a hold of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[carp/carps] now. Keep bringing them--I wouldn't want to lose to my brother!${prompt};
This is a fine haul you've brought! I thank you!${prompt};
Eh...what's this? I'm afraid I can't accept this. It's not what I asked you for, is it?${prompt};
Ah, so you've been helping my brother, have you!?;
Traitor! Turncoat! Be gone with you!${prompt};
You'll be ecstatic to know that you've brought me more than 10,000 carps! I'd like to give you these tokens of my tremendous appreciation. Keep up the good work!${prompt};
You've collected ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[carp/carps] for ${choice: 0}[Gallijaux/Joulet] so far.${prompt};
Those two--so feverish are they in their devotion to the art of fishing that they lose count of their haul of fish and have to start over from the beginning.${prompt};
Those two... I do wish they wouldn't carp so about who can catch more fish than whom. And why should I care either way?${prompt};
Welcome to the auction house.;
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};
What do you want to know?;
${selection-lines};
What is the auction house?;
How are auctions run?;
Are there any fees?;
Are there any limits?;
How do you check up on merchandise?;
How do you remove an item?;
My “Sales Status” list is full!;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};
To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt};
Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt};
At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt};
Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt};
Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt};
In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt};
I wonder who that beautiful young lass is waiting for every day and every night down by the docks...${prompt};
I dare you to go down there and ask her name. You think you could handle that?${prompt};
You've got to be joking! We're still on duty! Though I do get off in three hours...${prompt};
A fine tune it is. Never heard it before, but it somehow sounds familiar...${prompt};
I never thought I'd live to hear that melody again. Brings back memories, it does...${prompt};
You still haven't found the girl you're looking for?${prompt};
No, I have not...${prompt};
Don't worry. She'll turn up, I guarantee it. You'd have to be crazy not to be drawn by the sweet melody of Ulmia's harp.${prompt};
Hey, music-lady, you wouldn't happen to be looking for somebody, would you?${prompt};
Ah...y-yes I am!${prompt};
I am searching for a young girl. Her hair is light blue, and she is dressed in the theologian gowns of the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Blue hairrr... Theologian gowns...${prompt};
Sounds a lot like the girl that the guys up in Jeuno are looking for.${prompt};
!;
Um...${prompt};
Kind traveler, do you know anything of the girl that the Duchy seeks?${prompt};
Yeah, well, it just happens to be that I'm looking for the same girl.${prompt};
Now whether that girl is the same girl you'rrre looking for...I don't know.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I do not mean to pry, but has Jeuno hired you to find the girl they are searching for?${prompt};
Does it look like I work for the Duchy? If that's what you want to believe, go rrright ahead. You Elvaan are all the same--only seeing what you want to see.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hey, did you know that along with the girl's, there's another warrant out for the capture of some strrrange boy?${prompt};
How much do you want to bet that those two are togetherrr?${prompt};
I do not know...;
But if the girl you and I are searching for is the same person, I can tell you this: she is not one to run.${prompt};
Huh...;
Catching mice is what we Mithra live for, but it's turning out to look like this job is going to be a little differrrent.${prompt};
Oh well, I don't have time to play two games of cat and mouse, so I guess I'll just concentrrrate on the boy.${prompt};
Wait!;
What... What do you know of the boy?${prompt};
Hah hah...;
Music-lady, you should be careful about what you ask. The answerrr might just bite you back.${prompt};
...${prompt};
If the girl you are looking for is the same one I'm seeking, then we'll meet again.${prompt};
If you still want to know the answerrr to your question, then I guess it wouldn't hurt to tell you. Until next time...${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
What do you wish to ask?;
${selection-lines};
Are you all right?;
Who was that?${prompt};
I-I'm fine...;
I do not know who that Mithra was, but I have a feeling she is searching for Prishe.${prompt};

Prishe is...;
${selection-lines};

Oh, thank you, ${name-player}.;
It comforts me to hear you say that.${prompt};
So you feel the same as I, ${name-player}...;
However...${prompt};
As long as you are here by my side, I believe that everything will be fine...${prompt};
I...;
Oh, I am sorry. I did not mean...${prompt};
Lady Hinaree has introduced me to many people she believed may know something of Prishe, but I have uncovered nothing...${prompt};
I am so worried... If anything were to happen to her...${prompt};
What?;
You have a message from Lady Hinaree?${prompt};
I am to meet with High Priest Chasalvige in the cathedral?${prompt};
Thank you very much, ${name-player}!${prompt};

You hear more and more talk of the Dragon King Ranperre these days. They say that his top vassal was a dragoon. I wonder what ever happened to all the dragoons...${prompt};
I heard that to become a dragoon, you had to make a pact with a living wyvern. However, thanks to the dragonslayers, there aren't that many dragons left.${prompt};
The dragonslayers keep down the number of deadly dragons, but the number of dragoons can never go up. It's a sad, sad cycle.${prompt};
They say that King Ranperre's top vassal, the “Last of the Dragoons,” collapsed after a battle with a dragonslayer.${prompt};
I even heard a rumor that a new dragoon appeared in San d'Oria, but no one has ever seen him. Some even say that it is that Cyranuce, locked up in the dungeons.${prompt};

How goes it? Making mountains of gil, you two? You know I've got no use for those who don't bring in the cash.${prompt};
Sure, Boss.;
Here, this week's profits.${prompt};
You're cutting it pretty close, there.;
Well, at least you're consistent. Keep it rolling in.${prompt};
And what about you? Meeting your quota, I trust?${prompt};
Uh, actually, Boss, I...${prompt};
Hm? Are you trying to tell me you haven't met your quota?;
You just had a baby, though, didn't you? Probably costs a fortune keeping the little one fed.${prompt};
Y-yes, Boss.${prompt};
You know what you need to do, right?${prompt};
Meet my quota, Boss!${prompt};
Got it in one.;
I'll give you a little more time this week. But if this happens again, you and your kid'll be out on the street!${prompt};
Good Goddess...${prompt};
What're you gonna do? Have you got anyone you can go to?${prompt};
No, no one I can think of.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} are not that easy to get ahold of. My family's gonna be begging in the alley at this rate.${prompt};
Do you think that you could find me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? I can't pay you anything, and I know it's a lot to ask...${prompt};
Help him out?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, why not.;
I only work for cold, hard gil.${prompt};
Really?;
Well, I won't hold my breath. There aren't too many adventurers who work for nothing these days.${prompt};
Can't say I'm surprised.;
Haven't met many adventurers who work for free.${prompt};
Well, I'm not gonna hold my breath waiting for that ${item-singular: 7[2]}. There aren't too many adventurers who work for nothing these days.${prompt};
Meeting your quota is an iron rule of the Brugaire Consortium. I've seen more than a few prospective merchants shown the door after failing to observe it. The business world is an unforgiving place.${prompt};
You're gonna let me have this? I didn't think adventurers like you still existed. The boss would do well to take a lesson in compassion from you...${prompt};
What do I need to be learning a lesson in?${prompt};
Ah, Boss!;
I, uh, I was just talking about changing my baby's diapers, and thought that you might need to learn someday, in case you were thinking of having children...${prompt};
...I think I'll pass on that.;
Diapers aside, have you met your quota yet?${prompt};
H-here you go, Boss.${prompt};
Hmm, this'll do, I suppose.;
Keep to your deadline next time.${prompt};
Yes, sir!${prompt};
Boss!${prompt};
What is it? Did you get caught smuggling again?${prompt};
I came to inform you that your father has just passed away. Funeral arrangements need to be made...${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Boss, I'm sorry for your loss...${prompt};
Loss? Who's lost anything?;
My father was just a foolish old man. I wanted to do anything but follow in his footsteps.${prompt};
He would be at work from sunrise to sunset, so I never had what you could call a “conversation” with him. And despite the hours he spent at his trade, we never had any money. I was always out making deliveries for pocket change.${prompt};
I haven't seen the old man for years now, but I suppose I must give him a funeral for decency's sake.${prompt};
The boss has never talked about his family before... It's kinda surprising that he even has a father in the first place.${prompt};
I hope my child will be sad when I leave this world... Dammit, I'm starting to tear up. Gotta get back to work.${prompt};
I'm glad the boss hasn't been hit too hard by the loss of his father, but you know...${prompt};
He has my sympathies.${prompt};
Ouch, that still stings...${prompt};
Boss, what happened to you?${prompt};
After the funeral, I left with my father's inheritance, and then some scoundrel clouted me from behind. When I woke up, a young lady was binding my wound, and my inheritance was gone.${prompt};
Are you sure you're all right?;
And your inheritance, what of that...${prompt};
It was just some old armor that wasn't of any real value to me.${prompt};
But there was this rich merchant who was interested in buying it for a high price. I hate to see a source of revenue get away from me like that.${prompt};
This kind of criminal is more than the merchants can deal with. We need an adventurer who's no stranger to battle. Your reward will be twenty percent of the selling price of the armor. Come back here when you have it.${prompt};
The boss doesn't take no for an answer. Actually, he usually doesn't give you a chance to answer...;
But for this job, you can't help but take his side in the matter.${prompt};
The cad that mugged our boss must have been following him the whole time. There must be someone who saw what happened.${prompt};
The girl who tended to the boss after his attack picked up that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}? Hmm, I guess it could have belonged to his attacker...${prompt};
That kind of jewelry isn't worth much without the matching earring. It looks to be of reasonably high quality, and would bring in a nice profit if you could get the Goldsmith's Guild to recreate its partner.${prompt};
The person who attacked our boss must have lost their desire to live. As soon as you find out who it is, the boss is gonna beat them to a pulp! ${prompt};
You got it back?;
Good work! Let's go tell the boss.${prompt};
This is it. You have my thanks, adventurer.${prompt};
My father was hired to repair this armor, but the customer never showed to collect it after it was fixed. Not knowing what else to do, he just decided to hold on to it.${prompt};
Apparently there were quite a few potential buyers, but my father made excuses not to part with it.${prompt};
Well, if someone wants to buy this armor, then that's fine by me. Get it off my hands and fill my pockets at the same time!${prompt};
Brugaire, the weapons you delivered to the knights contained many blades of poor quality. Surely you inspected your goods before sending them off?${prompt};
What? Yeah, of course I did.;
If you have a problem with the quality, we can always take them back. I don't think you'll find another distributor who deals in that kind of quantity, though.${prompt};
...You would take advantage of us? Have you no pride in your work...?;
You are nothing like your father was.${prompt};
You knew my father?${prompt};
I cannot count the number of knights who owe their lives to the sturdy armor crafted by that man. We have lost a truly talented and valued individual. You have my deepest sympathies.${prompt};
...I never knew about that.${prompt};
In honor of your father, I will let this matter of shoddy weapons pass.;
However, I should tell you I have heard rumors that the Tenshodo are considering expanding their business into San d'Oria.;
...I bid you good day, Brugaire.${prompt};
That haughty sonofa...;
He sounds just like my father.${prompt};
...Hmph. Pride, huh.${prompt};
Ah, Felippe will be here soon.${prompt};
Brugaire, you have the item we discussed?${prompt};
Yeah, I got it...${prompt};
Well then, let us be down to business.;
This piece will be the pride of my collection.${prompt};
What's the matter? Having troubles with the authorities again?;
Fear not! I can help clear up any “misunderstandings.”${prompt};
...Felippe, I hate to do this to you, but can we just forget about this whole deal?${prompt};
...?;
If my offer is too low, I'm open to negotiation.${prompt};
No, it's not that.;
It's a problem of conscience.;
I'll pay you a fee for breaking our deal, so just let it go, okay?${prompt};
It's a bit late for that!;
I've already bragged to all my friends about my new acquisition. You'll make me a laughingstock!${prompt};
I realize this goes against all our rules, but I'm not gonna back down on this. Please understand, Felippe.${prompt};
Hmph! You were the one who brought this deal to me in the first place. I don't appreciate being toyed with, Brugaire...;
Don't come crying to me when you can't find another buyer!${prompt};
Boss, are you all right?${prompt};
I... This has nothing to do with what that walking tin can said about my father.;
Just holding on to this thing reminds me of my old man and the things he used to lecture me about... It makes my teeth grind.${prompt};
Here, you can have this.;
You're the one who brought it back here, after all.${prompt};
Your father's inheritance...;
Boss, are you sure?${prompt};
If I say I'm sure, then I'm sure, all right!;
It seems I've gotten something more valuable in its place...${prompt};
My father used to say to me, “The pride that a craftsman takes in his work is reflected in the quality of his wares.”${prompt};
I've never really thought about what that meant before...${prompt};
Boss, where are you going?${prompt};
I'm just gonna go pay my respects to my father.;
Tell him that maybe his way of living wasn't so bad after all...${prompt};
Our boss is really a nice guy, but he's just a little awkward in expressing himself. It's that quality that makes me wanna keep working for him.${prompt};
I might send my mother something nice for the holidays. We've all but disowned each other, so it makes it difficult for me to just drop in.${prompt};
The boss has a question for you. Wait here a moment.${prompt};
There's something I forgot to ask.;
Who the hell was the rogue that stole my father's inheritance?${prompt};
What, you can't tell me the name?;
And there's someone who's pulling this thief's strings?;
Hmmm...things just got interesting. I'd really like to catch whoever it is and break a few of their teeth.${prompt};
This guy must be after the relics of the last dragoon...;
If we can find the armor before him, maybe we can use it to lure him out into the open.${prompt};
If you say you can't tell me the name of the thief, I'm sure you got your reasons. I'm not interested in sparring with a small fry, in any case. Instead, there's something I want you to procure for me.${prompt};
I want you to find the helm of the last dragoon, hidden somewhere within the Kuftal Tunnel. I've wanted to get my hands on it for some time now, and an adventurer like yourself is perfect for the job.;
Well, don't just stand there!${prompt};
You've got nerve, keeping secrets from the boss... I think you'd be better off finding that treasure chest in the Kuftal Tunnel and getting back here as soon as possible!${prompt};
Huh, the chest was empty!?;
All you found was some letter of defiance...?;
When the boss finds out, he's gonna hit the roof! He hates to be made a fool of...${prompt};
I went down to the jail to beat the hell out of that Ancolain for making a fool out of me, but started to feel kinda ridiculous.;
...He's suffering plenty already.${prompt};
I heard it all from Rahal.;
He told me things got pretty tense out there.;
But it's those kinds of situations that make life interesting, don't you think?${prompt};
I've been thinking about what my work means to me, and truth to tell, I couldn't really say. What I can say, though, is that this business gives me some exciting times.${prompt};
And isn't that enough?;
I might find out what it all means someday, and then again, I might not. But I never got into this business to soul-search, anyway.${prompt};
Enough of that kinda talk.;
You boys better be on target for your quotas for next week!;
Be seeing you soon.${prompt};
All this “last dragoon” business has tired me out, but at least it's never dull around here! Keeps me motivated, even if meeting my quota can be stressful sometimes.${prompt};
Urgh... I think I'm gonna struggle to get clear this week.;
But you'll be there to bail me out, right!?${prompt};
Wh-when will the airship from Tavnazia arrive!?${prompt};
I am sorry, but we have no records for the type of airship you described.${prompt};
Vessels not registered with the air travel agency are considered illegal, and are only permitted to dock here in emergency situations.${prompt};
Did you truly see an airship like that?;
Are you sure it wasn't a dream or hallucination?${prompt};
Are you still going on about that imaginary airship?;
I assure you, every single vessel is strictly monitored by the air travel agency.${prompt};
Even under the orders of the cathedral, no airship can be freely commandeered to fly off to any old place in Vana'diel--especially not the Tavnazian Marquisate!${prompt};
If you don't believe me, try asking at any of the other agencies.;
That is, if you don't mind having people doubt your sanity...${prompt};
Beans, beans, and more beans.;
If the world were not in this sorry state, my connections with the count would have me seated at a banquet table.${prompt};
Will not Uncle Louverance restore the Knights Mistalle to our former glory in the foreseeable future?;
An age has passed since he left on his journey to the north...${prompt};
What's this?;
You wish to hear more of my uncle?;
You have strange interests for an adventurer, friend.${prompt};
If you wish to learn more about my uncle, why not meet with him in person?;
He can be found somewhere beyond the Uleguerand Range, north of Xarcabard.${prompt};
The Orcish forces passed over the Uleguerand Range to stage their invasion into Quon.;
Several hundred years ago, during their efforts to halt the Orcs' advance through the mountains, the Royal Knights drew a map of the area.${prompt};
Access to this map is strictly controlled, and it cannot be freely borrowed.${prompt};
The cartography was based on intelligence gathered in the conflict with the Orcish Empire...${prompt};
...and perusal of the map will reveal the Royal Knights' battle tactics.${prompt};
Due to the return of Lord Excenmille--and his report that the Orcish Empire's strength far exceeds our estimates--the map has been placed under even tighter security.${prompt};
In the case of my uncle, his problem was solved by the appearance of a man who offered to guide him across the mountains.${prompt};
According to that guide, the northern side of the Uleguerand Range can be reached through the tunnels that wind beneath Thousandfall Ridge.${prompt};
If you truly intend to meet with my uncle, tell him his nephew, Antreneau, worries for him and wishes for his swift return.${prompt};
If you wish to meet with my uncle, you must cross the Uleguerand Range.${prompt};
I am not permitted to give you a map of the area, however I will tell you the directions the guide gave my uncle.${prompt};
According to the guide, a cave found on the slopes of Thousandfall Ridge leads to the other side of the Uleguerand Range.${prompt};
You actually managed to find my uncle!?${prompt};
So, he is well?;
He travels a hard path, if what you say is true.;
I feel ashamed to be complaining of nothing more than a steady diet of beans.${prompt};
But I cannot quell this desire for meat!;
Bring me meat! Any dish with meat in it will do!${prompt};

It can be fun to dine in fine company, but there are times when you simply want to eat alone.${prompt};

You have a friend along, but my guess is that you'd prefer to eat by yourself.${prompt};
Hmmm.;
Eating alone is actually rather dull.;
Why don't you share this with your partner?;
I seem to have lost my appetite.${prompt};

<Match ${number: 0}>;
Entry period begins: ${earthtime: 1};
Briefing begins: ${earthtime: 2}${prompt};
I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.${prompt};
Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times:;
Match 1: ${earthtime: 0};
Match 2: ${earthtime: 1};
Match 3: ${earthtime: 2}${prompt};
Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of ${number: 0} gil is required before each match.${prompt};
Travel to the Isle?;

Yes.;

Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
Hey!;
You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right?;

Wow! Another present!;
Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?${prompt};

Hey, do you know who made those festive trees that decorate the Kingdom?;
Well, you're looking at him. That's right!;
Did you come for my autograph?${prompt};
Ever since the ornaments went up, I've been swamped with orders for new ones. I can't blame them, though. I mean, once you've seen the best, how can you put up with anything less? Am I right?${prompt};
However, with all this work, I've hardly had any time to live the celebrity lifestyle. To tell you the truth, I barely have the time to fetch my new shipments of supplies!;
Hey, you look like you've got some spare time on your hands. What do you say? Help out a rising superstar on his path to glory?${prompt};
Lend a hand?;
${selection-lines};
Okay!;
Maybe not today.${prompt};
Hmph... And I was even thinking of giving you my autograph in return...${prompt};
That's the spirit! Now, let's see...;
I need you to rush down to the residential area and pick up an order of materials from the local ${color: 5}market moogle${color: 1}.${prompt};
Pick up the order of supplies from the moogle in front of the residential area. C'mon, I don't have all day! I've got people to see, places to go, things to do!${prompt};
Excellent!;
With these supplies, I'll be able to finish my orders in time to have a drink with that tall Elvaan that came by this morning...${prompt};
Yeah, it's hard being a master craftsman and an international heartthrob, but hey, what are you going to do?${prompt};
...And why are you still here?;
Oh, yeah. That's right. My autograph.;
I don't seem to have a pen on me, so you'll have to settle with this mini holiday tree.${prompt};
Oh, it's you. I couldn't wait any longer for you to bring back those supplies, so I used something else in their place.;
Now, the next shipment I need you to bring me is from the moogle in front of the Northern San d'Oria residential area. What, you didn't think you were done, did you?${prompt};
I need the goods in less than ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours], now. Chop chop!${prompt};
The moogle with my supplies is in front of the Northern San d'Oria residential area.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
I know they say that in life you should stop and smell the roses, but none of those guys had orders to fill!;
Now, I'm going to give you one more chance. Hurry down to the Southern San d'Oria residential area and pick up my materials from the market moogle.${prompt};
The moogle with my supplies is in front of the Southern San d'Oria residential area.${prompt};
Just couldn't get enough of yours truly, huh?;
Well, because I love my fans, I'll let you help me out again...but just this once!${prompt};
Run over to the Northern San d'Oria residential area and pick up my supplies from the market moogle. You've got ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours].${prompt};
Okay, why don't you zip on down to the Southern San d'Oria residential area and pick up my materials from the market moogle. I'll give you...${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours] to get back.${prompt};
Here's your reward.;
Sorry I couldn't give you my autograph. I still can't seem to find my pen...${prompt};
Sorry, but I couldn't wait any longer. I found a bigger fan to help me out.${prompt};
Phew... Finally some time to rest. Now where did I put that Elvaan's linkshell number...?${prompt};
The goods I deal in are too sensitive for just any adventurer to handle. These materials are exclusively for use by a proven craftsman, kupo!${prompt};
The goods I deal in are too sensiti--;
Hm? You're here to pick up the craftsman's supplies? Well, why didn't you say so?${prompt};
What? Are you still here?;
I though I told that craftsman “no refunds,” kupo!${prompt};

"We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called ""Azimuth Circle""!${prompt}";
Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!;
First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt};
After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt};
However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt};
At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt};
Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo!;
To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo!;
Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.;
If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!${prompt};
Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?${prompt};
Play the game?;
${selection-lines};
Ready to go!;
I'll pass.${prompt};
When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt};
If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt};
Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt};
Well, kupo?;
You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt};
Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, freedom!;
I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt};
Your game has been cancelled.;
If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!${prompt};
You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!;
Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt};
We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo～!${prompt};
The direction of your partner's checkpoint is ${choice: 0}[east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!${prompt};
There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing ${choice: 0}[east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].${prompt};
You see something lying on the ground!${prompt};
You cannot check any more checkpoints.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
I must say, things are rather lively in town today.;
Do you not agree, Regine?${prompt};
With all the people coming in and out, I find myself hoping some rich red mage without a spell to her name might wander in and purchase our entire stock...${prompt};
Just when you think a customer has finally appeared, they flash that silly badge and begin prattling about the “Empire of Aht Urhgan.” As if we would know anything about such an exotic country.${prompt};
Who would dream that either of us had even traveled beyond the borders of San d'Oria?;
Do they believe we are like the Tavnazians of old and maintain trading partners in the Near East?${prompt};
I hear the town of Al Zahbi, a strategic location in the west of Aht Urhgan, often finds itself surrounded by invading beastman forces...;
What feeble defenses they must have in the Near East.${prompt};
This is what comes of a nation that does not embrace the path of chivalry.;
Our heroic knights would make short work of any beastman horde, no matter their number!;
Long live King Destin!${prompt};
Hmph, thinking of becoming a mercenary, are you?;
Let me give you some advice: The beastmen of the Near East are far more savage than the fiends of Ronfaure.${prompt};
I would avoid those lands until I was sure of my strength. They care not who they kill--in that respect, they are much like the Orcs.${prompt};
In war, survival is key.;
Picking your battles is also a valid strategy.${prompt};
That's called “Knowing your enemy,” that is!${prompt};
Yeah!;
“Knowing your anemone!”${prompt};
I hear frightful tales from the Near East. They say that the beastmen are leading armies into the lands of people.${prompt};
That badge...;
It is as if the terrible events of twenty years past have returned to haunt us...${prompt};
Yes, the nation they speak of lies far away, yet I feel the seed of fear blossom in my heart.;
War is like a raging fire that leaps from country to country, consuming all in its path...${prompt};
I wonder what culinary delights grace the tables of the Near East.${prompt};
The rice dish “pilaf” is rumored to be delicious.;
All those exotic spices...${prompt};
<Rumble...>;
Oh! It seems I have awoken the beast of my appetite with all these gastronomic musings!${prompt};
Hm...${prompt};
I do not remember ever seeing you before. What do you need of me?${prompt};
Show him Leleroon's letter?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not now.${prompt};
Well now, what have we here? I have not seen Leleroon in a long time. I wonder how the little Qiqirn is doing...${prompt};
You are a member of the Seagull Phratrie, correct? Sorry for my curt words earlier.${prompt};
I was a member of the Black Cradle's crew until that giant hole was blown into its hull... Then I ventured here to San d'Oria.${prompt};
As the oldest member, all the battles were starting to take their toll on me. So when the ship sank, I took the opportunity to retire.${prompt};
You came here in order to get some quality corsair armor, did you?${prompt};
Well then, you have come to the right place. I can make ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for you.${prompt};
However, first I must test your skill as a corsair and determine that you are up to my standard. Until now, I have created equipment for Qultada only.${prompt};
You have met Qultada, have you not?${prompt};
When I decided to abandon life at sea, the fool tried desperately to stop me.${prompt};
Anyway, that is all in the past.${prompt};
Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt};
I cannot do anything until you bring me the materials first.${prompt};
Come back after you manage to find them.${prompt};
Ah, I see you've managed to find all the materials. Good work.${prompt};
All you have to do now is pay the costs of production.${prompt};
That will be ${number: 5} ${item-given-plurality: 5[2], 4[2]}...${prompt};
I am not going anywhere. Just bring the materials whenever you want.${prompt};
Well, this is an unexpected development...${prompt};
I guess I will have to actually make your equipment, then! Please wait a while until I can finish.${prompt};
Patience, now, patience. Hasty work makes sloppy work.${prompt};
The way of the corsair means being able to show the world an easygoing smile in the most anxious of times.${prompt};
So relax and wait just a bit longer.${prompt};
Here you go... A genuine ${item-singular: 6[2]}, all for you.${prompt};
Ah, the corsairs... Those were the days...${prompt};
Qultada and I had many a disagreement on that ship. I used to have more of a temper.${prompt};
I thought we should stop hounding the Empire.${prompt};
I often disagreed with his methods, and eventually left the Phratrie because of it.${prompt};
Now that I am here on land, though, I am starting to understand his ideas, too. I have had a lot to think about...${prompt};
It seems to me that a captain is a lot like the sea breeze...${prompt};
Leading a storm of a crew... Pressing ever forward over the seas...${prompt};
You know Qultada, so you must know what I mean.${prompt};
That man can be like a hurricane...${prompt};
When you came to visit me the other day, I felt the same qualities in you.${prompt};
Such memories make me long to return to life on the endless waves...${prompt};
Please give everyone my blessings.${prompt};
I can no longer sail, but I have no doubt that you and your companions will shape a new path for the corsairs.${prompt};
Are you properly caring for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Whenever you have the time, please tell me how things are going on the Aradjiah continent.${prompt};
I have been long separated from Aradjiah, but the smell of the sea is the same across Urhguum.${prompt};
Whenever I close my eyes, my homeland spreads out before me as vividly as ever.${prompt};
Hello! When it comes to celebrating and festivities, I'm your moogle, kupo!;

You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...${prompt};
If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.${prompt};
When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!${prompt};

The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.${prompt};
They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.${prompt};
Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt};
They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt};
The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt};
But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!${prompt};

“Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt};
You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt};
“Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt};
You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt};
If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt};
“Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt};
However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt};

A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt};
How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt};
You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt};
When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt};
With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt};
The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt};
You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt};
The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt};
However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt};
We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt};
Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt};
Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt};
However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt};
But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt};
The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt};
You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};

A general explanation.;
Watching over your chocobo.;

Scolding.;
Competing.;
Taking a walk.;
Nothing.${prompt};
In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt};
On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt};
However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt};
You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt};
You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt};
I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt};
Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt};
This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt};
Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt};
I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt};
Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Why feeding is important.;
Vegetables.;
Wildgrasses.;
Carrots.;
Worms.;
Medicines.;
Pastes.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt};
However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt};
The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt};
At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt};
Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt};
There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt};
Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt};
This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt};
Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt};
Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt};
In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt};
Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt};
Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt};
For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt};
But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt};
The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt};
Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt};
A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt};
Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt};
You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt};
Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt};
Which would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Abilities.;
Temperament.;
Weather preferences.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt};
For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt};
Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt};
But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt};
The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt};
Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt};
Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt};
Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt};
You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt};
After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt};
When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt};
You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt};
The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt};
You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt};
When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};
Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.${prompt};
If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Chococards.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}.;
Nothing.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.${prompt};
With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.${prompt};
If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt};
You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt};
The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt};
Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt};
Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt};
If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt};
Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt};
If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};

${name-player}, could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping soundly at night.${prompt};
I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.${prompt};
I will dispose of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!${prompt};
As you say, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...${prompt};
I gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was but a chick.${prompt};
I am afraid ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust me more than you...${prompt};
You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.${prompt};
I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
You would like to tend to this egg?${prompt};
We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It will not be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} no longer seems lonely.${prompt};
...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?${prompt};
I am not sure what to say to that!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been behaving quite spoiled as of late. You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wanted attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I am sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love, but it is feeling better now and its appetite has returned. Everything should be all right.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! I wonder what kind of name you will choose...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it awakens.${prompt};
Your chocobo should grow accustomed to its name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We have been taking good care of your egg. I cannot wait to see how the chick will look.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It appeared to be having pleasant dreams...${prompt};
I took the chocobo on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} exercised with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${wait-35: 8}${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a child...${prompt};
...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}? Oh...oh yes! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. It enjoyed playing to the crowds...${prompt};
However, it got a bit too carried away, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for San d'Oria.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, San d'Oria was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, San d'Oria awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You would not believe what it has found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but turned up with very few items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};

Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding your egg.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is all for now. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let us analyze your egg's current condition...${prompt};
Let us analyze ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s current condition...${prompt};
I cannot tell yet whether the chocobo will be male or female.${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo is...a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Discernment: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg does not seem to be in the best condition at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can provide it with proper care.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because West Ronfaure is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt}${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The La Theine Plateau is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should not grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Jugner Forest. Being together such a long time should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for San d'Oria, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What is this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?${prompt};
You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I can't do it anymore.;
No, I want to continue.${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?${prompt};
Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?${prompt};
If you decide to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Give up raising your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No!${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
What would you like to say?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...${prompt};
Is that so? That is a proper attitude...${prompt};
...;
I am disappointed in you.${prompt};
You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.${prompt};
I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
Are you sure you want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?${prompt};
Really retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, really!;
No, I've changed my mind!${prompt};
Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.${prompt};
Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, is it not? But have no fear...you can see it again. Keep your chin up.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I shall prepare ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
The preparations will cost ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
I have your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You may take it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I can give you a new one, but it will cost you ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And do not worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I have been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}...;
What is this all about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...${prompt};
The owner's name begins with the letter ${choice: 0}[C/L/V].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[a town information guide/a watchman/someone who delivers parcels/a merchant].${prompt};
I will do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I have gathered new information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up a moment ago. I am glad that we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions.;
Might I trouble you to choose another combination?${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.${prompt};
Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...${prompt};
I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
I think that should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby.${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is becoming one fine bird, if you ask me!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. You can get one at the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're already raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
So you'd like to tend to this egg, eh?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... Let's make a fine chocobo out of this one.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Isn't it cute? You can name it later.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a hassle when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!${prompt};
You've done a great job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air. You're a natural at this!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal!${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
"But don't worry; this won't be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. You should probably feed it better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you, eh?${prompt};
...I've got no comment on that.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm really sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I'm happy to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know it had you worried sick, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must've missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I'm sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love. Everything should be all right now... Its appetite has returned and it appears to be feeling better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! Have any great ideas?${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up.${prompt};
I am sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how the chick looks.${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It's been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much, it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been out playing with the children of Bastok. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Eh?;
Oh yeah, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it.${prompt};
We put your chocobo on exhibition. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really played to the crowds...${prompt};
But it was a little too aggressive, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Bastok.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Bastok was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, Bastok awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};

In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};

The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I still can't tell whether the chocobo will be male or female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. Your chocobo is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue. You should not disturb it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes, too.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love with another chocobo.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};

Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because North Gustaberg is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Konschtat Highlands are not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Pashhow Marshlands. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Bastok, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's that? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any longer?${prompt};
Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}...;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};
I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt};
I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt};
I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt};
So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then! From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Come on, cheer up! This won't be your last meeting!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?${prompt};
Hey, don't look at me for an answer... I don't speak Chocobo, you know!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately! It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
Wow...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems really bored! You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems happier lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm so sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away! Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and it seems okay!${prompt};
I know you were just beside yourself with worry, but you should welcome your chocobo with open arms. It must've missed you a lot!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting weird lately. Its head is in the clouds and will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. That should cheer it up!${prompt};
It seems your chocobo was in love! Now it seems cheerful again and is eating like there's no tomorrow, so I guess things are back to normal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! What'll it be?${prompt};
Oh! Your chocobo likes its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time!${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how cute the chick will be!${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo has been passing its time here in the stables without a concern in the world!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made it a bit more patient!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of Windurst. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Oh...oh! Yes, of course, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} enjoyed it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it!${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. Your chocobo really played to the crowds!${prompt};
But it was a little too much sometimes, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Windurst.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Windurst was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
But it got lost sooo many times!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
Windurst compensates you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it!${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} dug for hours, but it hardly found anything!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};

There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}! I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}! What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I can't tell yet whether your chocobo will be a male or a female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};

Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days/ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};

Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care!${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it!${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you should discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love!${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing!${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all... I guess it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because East Sarutabaruta is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Tahrongi Canyon is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Meriphataud Mountains. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with some gil as thanks for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Windurst, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's this? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any more?${prompt};
What? You want to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you'll never ever see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again! You really don't mind?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Do you have anything you have to say for yourself?${prompt};
I guess if that's what you really want... Custody of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for it?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? This must be hard on you too, huh? Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? Then don't forget it!${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you stick with it through to the end!${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should stick with it to the end!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse!${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Well, all right... Then ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Here, let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I'll be needing from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}!;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hi, ${name-player}!;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / / /G/ /K/P].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].${prompt};
I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!${prompt};
That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Oh dear...;
You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions.;
You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.${prompt};
First, we must test the level of trust between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.${prompt};
I'm sure even ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hides things while you are not around...${prompt};
Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.${prompt};
If you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is completely absorbed in its current activities.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Search for the chocobo's item.;
Watch over the chocobo.${prompt};
You find something in the ground.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} appears to be very happy.${prompt};
Kweh!!!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} noticed what you were doing...${prompt};
You gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, didn't you?${prompt};
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.${prompt};
I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.${prompt};
One of the workers at our stable gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, right?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...${prompt};
At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.${prompt};
Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to want out...${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks happy to see you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't look very happy...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is in high spirits.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks irritated.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping peacefully.${prompt};
You feel a faint warmth in the room left behind by ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Now feeding the chocobo...${prompt};
${number: 1}: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo its food.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} gobbles up the ${item-singular: 3[2]} in a single gulp!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} munches contentedly on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} eats the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} quietly eats the food.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} munches discontentedly on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} munches discontentedly on the food.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} munches weakly on the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} gulps down the ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} happily takes the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is forcing itself to take the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} discontentendly swallows the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} weakly swallows the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has found something!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems interested in your story.${prompt};
Which would you like to talk about?;
${selection-lines};
Random chitchat.;
An impatient chocobo.;
A curious chocobo.;
A worrisome chocobo.;
A youthful chocobo.;
A happy chocobo.;
A diligent chocobo.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Gallop”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Canter”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Burrow”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Bore”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Auto-Regen”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Treasure Finder”!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem to understand your story...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is inspired by your story.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hangs its head in shame.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} awakens from its sleep.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is still fast asleep...${prompt};
Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!${prompt};
W-wow... You're pretty fast!${prompt};
Th-this is absurd...${prompt};
You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!${prompt};
This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...${prompt};
That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!${prompt};
Now have you learned never to underestimate ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}?${prompt};
This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!${prompt};
It's a tie!${prompt};
Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...${prompt};
Hmph. If ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!${prompt};
Luck was simply not with us today...${prompt};
Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?${prompt};
Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} just fine!${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};
Keh!${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} becomes friends with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} here...${prompt};
You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with ${entity: 1}...${prompt};
Good day to you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.${prompt};
I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?${prompt};
Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?${prompt};
What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!${prompt};
We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!${prompt};
Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.${prompt};
Foudeel is working on its intelligence.${prompt};
And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!${prompt};
Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?${prompt};
Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.${prompt};
Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?${prompt};
But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.${prompt};
Hey, I remember you!${prompt};
I'm glad you're taking the time to take ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!${prompt};
Oh, there you are!${prompt};
Glad to see you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out on walks! Keep it up!${prompt};
Well, what a coincidence.${prompt};
I'm glad to see that you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
Well, well!;
Fine meeting you here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I am pleased to see that you are taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!${prompt};
Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!${prompt};
Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo...${prompt};
Don't forget just how important regular communication with your chocobo is.${prompt};

Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}. Keep up the good work, ya hear?${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}. Keep it up.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}. Keep it up.${prompt};
Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?${prompt};
Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.${prompt};
Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.${prompt};
But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!${prompt};
It looked like he wanted me to take him out...${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};
Kwee!${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
Cheep.${prompt};
The chocobo appears to be lost...${prompt};
The chocobo chick appears to be lost...${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Bring it home.;
Leave it.${prompt};
Cheep...${prompt};
The chocobo chick follows ${name-player}...${prompt};
You look like you have something you want to ask. What do you want?${prompt};
The owner of a lost chick? Hm... This is just a hunch, but...${prompt};
Not long ago, I saw someone walking a chick.${prompt};
The owner's name began with the letter ${choice: 0}[C/L/V/ /G/ /K/P]. If I remember anything else, I'll let you know.${prompt};
The owner was ${choice: 0}[an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman/ / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra]. If I remember anything else, I'll let you know.${prompt};
The owner was ${choice: 0}[someone giving directions/a watchman/in the delivery service/a merchant/ /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer]. If I remember anything else, I'll let you know.${prompt};
Did you find the lost chick's owner yet?${prompt};
I thought about it a while, and remembered something else...${prompt};
It's been on my mind, but I haven't been able to remember anything else yet.${prompt};
You look like you have something you would like to ask. Is there something wrong?${prompt};
I see...;
So, you are searching for the owner of a lost chick? This is simply conjecture, but...${prompt};
I saw somebody walking a chick not too long ago.${prompt};
The owner's name started with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A/K/P], if I remember right. If I recall anything else, I'll let you know.${prompt};
The owner was ${choice: 0}[/ / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman/a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra]. If I recall anything else, I will let you know.${prompt};
The owner was ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer]. If I recall anything else, I will let you know.${prompt};
Have you found the lost chick's owner yet?${prompt};
I remembered something else...${prompt};
I have not been able to remember anything else yet. My apologies.${prompt};
You look like you've got a burning question on your mind. What's wrong?${prompt};
You're looking for the owner of a lost chick, huh? This is just a hunch, but...${prompt};

Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch.;
This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.${prompt};
I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.${prompt};
Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.${prompt};
How about you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]?${prompt};
If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in ${choice: 0}[Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Sign me up!;
Not today.${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}!;
You are now an official member of the CRA's ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
I see.;
Please come back if you ever change your mind!${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Why race chocobos, anyway?;
How do I register for a race?;
How do I prepare for a race?;
What are ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}?;
What kind of races are there?;
What are “racing teams”?;
Quit.;
Return.${prompt};
Why not!?;
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};
You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt};
Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt};
Join this team?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!${prompt};
Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.${prompt};
Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.${prompt};
What do we have here...${prompt};

----------------------------------------;
★Free Run★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: None${prompt};
While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.${prompt};
Here is the information on the next race:${prompt};
★Novice Race I★;

Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.${prompt};
★Novice Race III★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you.;

Portals.;
Guides.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.${prompt};
It can be found just south of here.${prompt};
The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt};
Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt};
There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt};
All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt};
The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt};
To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt};
The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} will be provided anytime you purchase ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or sign up for a race.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.${prompt};
This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt};
As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt};
For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished.;
Your cooperation is appreciated.${prompt};
Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.${prompt};
They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.${prompt};
This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Racing teams.;
Race rules.;
Race types.;
Victory points.;
Race Progression.;
That's about it.${prompt};
A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt};
Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt};
In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt};
For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt};
The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt};
What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt};
Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt};
The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt};
The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt};
The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt};
In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt};
Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt};
Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt};
For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt};
We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt};
No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt};
Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt};
As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt};
Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt};
Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt};
The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt};
As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt};
Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt};
Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt};
Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt};
Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt};

Signing up for another race.;
I'm fine, thanks.${prompt};
There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt};
First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt};
Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt};
Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt};
All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt};
A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt};
Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt};
There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt};
There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt};
Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt};
In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt};
The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt};
You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt};
To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt};
The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt};
You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt};
After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt};
This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt};
We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt};
What would you like to ask?;
${selection-lines};
What is chocobetting?;
How do I bet?;
What are odds?;
When do I bet?;
How do I collect winnings?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt};
To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt};
Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};
And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt};
Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};
The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt};
To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt};
For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt};
We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt};
Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt};
Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt};
It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt};
What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt};
Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt};
The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt};
Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt};
Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt};
Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt};
Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt};
Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt};
Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt};

With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt};
As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt};
“The Monster Races”!${prompt};
Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt};
Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.;
What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};
The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.;
It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt};
Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.;
If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;
Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.;
Thank you for your understanding.${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt};
We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.;
The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt};
Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.;
And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt};
As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.;
It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.;
Consider yourself warned.${prompt};
In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.;
Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.;
It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt};
Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.;
These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt};

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.${prompt};
Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...${prompt};
...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt};
Good day, fol--${prompt};
ピヨ！${prompt};
Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt};
Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt};
First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt};
ピヨピヨ！${prompt};
She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt};
She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt};
She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt};
She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt};
She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt};
She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt};
She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt};
She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt};
Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt};
Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt};
Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt};
Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt};
ピヨ～♪${prompt};
Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt};
The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt};
She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt};
She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt};
She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt};
And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt};
And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt};
The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt};
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.;
And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...;
...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!;
Good day, fol--;
ピヨ！;
Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.;
And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!;
#${number: 4}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]};
#${number: 5}: ${chocobo-name: 1[2]};
#${number: 6}: ${chocobo-name: 2[2]};
#${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]};
And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!;
Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!;
I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt};
Yeah...;
Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt};
And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt};
Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt};
They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt};
Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt};
As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt};
${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt};
Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt};
Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt};
And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt};
ピヨッ！${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt};
a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt};
This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt};
Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt};
We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt};
Well, there you have it.${prompt};
Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen!;
President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt};
...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt};
Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt};
Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt};
Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt};
The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt};
Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt};
So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt};
Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt};
Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt};
My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt};
We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt};
Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt};
Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt};
What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt};
Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt};
Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt};
Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt};
Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt};
Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt};
And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt};
Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt};
Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt};
Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt};
The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt};
When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt};
When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Markovich, what did you think of the start?;
Well, I fel--;
ピヨピヨッ！;
Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.;
Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
And as they pass the halfway mark...;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!;
${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!;
While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!;
Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!;
And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!;
ピヨピヨ！;
Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed is approaching dangerous limits!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed has begun to drop off!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!;
The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!;
The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!;
The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!;
And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
And now they're approaching the final corner!;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!;
The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!;
What's this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
And it's ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!;
Let's take a look at the results...${prompt};
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt};
There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt};
Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt};
Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt};
Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt};
What an amazing race!;
The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt};
What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt};
The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt};
Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt};
Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt};
Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt};
The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt};
And there you have it.;
This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt};
And now, let's see the results from the last race.;
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1});
And that's all she wrote, folks!;
The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!;
Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?;
She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!;
She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.;
Until next time, race fans...;
Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt};
Taking the crown for today's race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
To the winning steed's owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt};
And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt};
Excellent race, ${name-player}!;
You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt};
Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt};
Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt};
But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt};

With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};
Oh...?;
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};
Is that so...?;
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};
But that's not where it ends!;
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;
But...${prompt};
But...?${prompt};
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};
I see...;
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};
But enough talking, I say.;
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};
Oh, yes, right...;
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};
Whoopee!;
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};
Erm...yes...;
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};
My, oh my...!;
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};
A-ahem!;
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;
<Sniffle>${prompt};
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Hrmmm...;
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};
And won't you look at the lineup!;
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};
Huh?;
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};
<Gulp>;
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};
Um...Professor Shantotto...;
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};
Ohohohohoho!;
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};
H-hey!;
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};
And you, Goccilo!;
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;
Until next time...!${prompt};
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};
What's with the baffled expression?;
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
But something seems to be different...;
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};
And that completes the lineup, folks.;
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};
But no more...;
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};
Well I'll be...;
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;
Congratulations!${prompt};
Great race, ${name-player}.;
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};
Princess...;
Princess Sakura!${prompt};
Princess...?;
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};
Searching for...me?${prompt};
Yes, Your Highness.;
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};
Are you serious!?;
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};
That is correct.;
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};
...!;
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};
Wh...what happened?${prompt};
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};
So that's what happened...${prompt};
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};
Your Highness!;
But...why!?${prompt};
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};
What's more...${prompt};
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};
What...?${prompt};
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;
I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt};
I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt};
Heehee!;
Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt};
${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!;
Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt};
You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt};
What?;
How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt};
Hohoho...;
It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt};
I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt};
Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?;
No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt};
Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt};
<Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.;
But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt};
You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.;
To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt};
And you, our new Chocochampion!;
Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt};
Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.;
These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Hrmmm!;
${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!;
Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?;
All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.;
But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.;
Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!;
And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!;
The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
What's this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt};
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!;
Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!;
And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!;
I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step.;
And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!;
And here's some unexpected drama, folks!;
The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?;
Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!;
Uh-oh, what's going on here!?;
The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!;
Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!;
What's this!?;
All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!;
Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!;
That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!;
Never in all my days, race fans!;
In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!;
How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?;
In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!;
Shantotto starts casting Tornado!;
The speed of the chocobos has dropped!;
The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!;
The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!;
Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?;
What in the world do you think you're doing!?;
Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.;
This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.;
What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?;
I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.;
This could get heavy, folks!;
All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.;
Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?;
It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!;
There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!;
More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!;
And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!;
The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.;
This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!;
This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.;
Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!;
And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!;
Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!;
And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!;
But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?;
I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!;
Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?;
It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!;
The time for a final spurt is now or never!;
And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?;

The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt};
It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.;
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.;
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;
Let's see here...${prompt};
Congratulations! Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can indeed hold ${choice: 1}[an/another] evolith aperture.;

That is all.;
Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt};
...Alas.;
It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt};
Hmm, what's this?;
It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt};
Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!?;

Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!;
What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt};
Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!;
Ain't synergy grand?${prompt};
Wait! No, don't tell me.;
You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt};
Learn about synergy?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
Teach me!;
Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.;
Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt};
I thought you'd never ask!;
Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt};
Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt};
What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha?;
Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!${prompt};

Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.${prompt};

${number: 1}<${number: 2}${prompt};
Welcome. What'll it be?${prompt};
What's that? You wish to know if a red-haired girl has been here of late?;
Apologies, but I cannot assist you at present. The kitchen demands my undivided attention.${prompt};
Wait a moment...;
You're an adventurer, are you not?${prompt};
Truly!? The Goddess be praised!;
I have urgent need of your assistance. Hear me out, I beg you.${prompt};
I've invented a new bean dish, you see, and require that a sample of it be delivered to Amaura, an elderly resident of Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
She has been my nose and mouth ever since I swapped my fishing rod for a skillet. It's become a custom between us that I have her ply her senses on new cuisine I create.${prompt};
Would that I could make the delivery myself while it's still fresh and piping hot, but my customers have voracious appetites and must needs be fed.${prompt};
Should you do me this one favor, you may consider my aid at your disposal.${prompt};
Please see the dish delivered to Amaura before it cools.${prompt};
Ah, you're back. I trust you had no difficulty making the delivery in good speed.;
And now, for good or ill, the moment of truth is come. What words did Amaura have for me?${prompt};
Truly? Naught is more heartening than a vote of confidence from her.;
I can now add the dish to my establishment's menu without reserve.${prompt};
Now then, I believe you had a request for me.;
By way of thanks, I shall do all in my power to assist you.${prompt};
You were searching for a friend, I believe.;
Describe her to me, and we shall see whether she has indeed been here.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
A girl born of Hume and Elvaan parents, with hair kissed by fire...${prompt};
Hrrrmmm...;
You've done me a great kindness, but I fear I may not be of much help in your quest.${prompt};
I could've sworn seeing who you describe...yet I can say neither when nor where that was.${prompt};
Mister Thierride!${prompt};
Why, if it isn't dear little Lilisette, come to pay visit.;
Have you been keeping well, lass?${prompt};
But of course! Have you ever known me to keep unwell?${prompt};
Hahahaha! It pleases me to hear that.;
It would please me even more, however, if you would be the first to taste my new bean dish.${prompt};
Truly!? I've been outside all day, and am hungry enough to eat a chocobo!${prompt};
Ahahaha! As milady commands, repast shall be served this instant!${prompt};
Voila! I give you my latest culinary invention!;
It's fresh off the cookfire, though, so do take care not to scald yourself.${prompt};
Wow! It looks sooo good!;
Over the lips and past the gums, look out tummy here it comes!♪${prompt};
Bon appétit! I eagerly await your impression!${prompt};
...?${prompt};
Phew...;
Thanks for the meal, Mister Thierride!${prompt};
...Hm? Wh-what is it?${prompt};
It wasn't very good this time, though.${prompt};
Wh-what did you say!?${prompt};
You used a different salt, right? It's got too much edge, and isn't so flattering on the beans...${prompt};
Wh-who do you presume to be, to find fault with my cuisine!? I feed you from my own hearth, yet you have the gall to repay me with mockery!?;
Away with you! Begone from my sight!${prompt};
Waaah! I'm...I'm sorry, Mister Thierride! <Sob>...;
Ah! It's coming back to me now!${prompt};
It feels like a lifetime ago when that little red-haired girl criticized my cooking...${prompt};
She tore my fragile pride to shreds with her innocent words. In a fit of anger, I took leave of myself and chased the poor lass away.${prompt};
After she had fled, however, I mulled over her comments...and found naught but truth in them.;
It was exactly as she had said regarding the seasoning.${prompt};
In retrospect, many and more of my success stories--my better-loved dishes--owe their existence to her.${prompt};
She was undeserving of my anger. It shames me still to think of my unseemly behavior that day.${prompt};
Hrmmm... Come to think of it, there was another little girl even before then, one equally given to speaking her mind with regards to my cuisine.${prompt};
But age has taken its toll, I fear, and my memory is reluctant to divulge anything in full nowadays.${prompt};
I'm sorry I couldn't be of greater help in your quest.;
But I promise you, when next I invent a new dish, you shall be the first to sample its savory delights.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
However, it is far too small to house an adequate amount of energy. Alone, it serves no purpose.${prompt};
The tiny fragments of Lilisette's memory meld together to form ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Ah, you must be the one they call ${name-player}.;
It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance.${prompt};
My compatriot Joachim has told me much of your exploits.;
It'd be my pleasure to assist you any way I can.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}. Is there something you need?${prompt};
What would like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
I want ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Learn about ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.;
Current ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} stock.;
Cavernous maw locations.;
Teleporting to a cavernous maw.;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
All set for now, are we? I'll be right here if ever you have need of me.${prompt};
Interested in the cavernous maws, are we?${prompt};
La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...${prompt};
Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...${prompt};
Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...${prompt};
In these ${choice: 1}[zero/three/six/nine] areas gateway maws have manifested.${prompt};
Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather?;
You'd be wise to make a habit of taking stock of your ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} prior to departure.${prompt};
The function of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is twofold.${prompt};
First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.${prompt};
Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.${prompt};
A single stone is good for a ${number: 1}-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to ${number: 2} can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.${prompt};
One thing to remember is that a good twenty hours (Earth time) are required to fully charge one stone. As such, I might not always have one on hand. I must beg your patience in that case.${prompt};
Here for your ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}?;
Let me see what I have for you...${prompt};
Hm? Why, it appears you already have ${number: 2} stones.;
I'm sorry, ${name-player}, but it'd be irresponsible of me to furnish you with any more. Heavens forbid I have a hand in stranding you in a foreign world.${prompt};
Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have any fully charged stones for you right now.;
Could you check back again in a while?${prompt};
Here you are, ${name-player}. That should suffice for the time being.${prompt};
With the power of cruor, it's possible to teleport to any cavernous maw serving as a gateway to Abyssea. You only need to have visited that maw once before.${prompt};
If you wish to go somewhere, a quick word with my assistant beside me here and you'll be off to your destination in the blinking of an eye.${prompt};
It'll take me ${number: 4} more ${choice-plurality: 4}[minute/minutes] (Earth time) to fully charge another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You wish to know how many ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} I have for you?;
Why, that'd be ${number: 1} of them.${prompt};
Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Obtained key item: ${number: 1} ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I don't believe we're acquainted. Please leave me be.${prompt};
<Sigh>... To see such vistas of peace and prosperity restored to my homeland once more...${prompt};
Greetings, friend of Abyssea. ${choice: 0}[/Ivan/Ernst/Kierron/Cyril/Willis/Vincent] is my name.;
My superior officer ${choice: 0}[/Gilburt/Erich/Jerrett/Adrian/Fabricius/Fabien] and I have been dispatched here to provide logistical support to allies of our cause.${prompt};
As you endeavor to restore light to our ravaged world, so too will we endeavor to aid you in every possible way.${prompt};
How might I assist you this day?${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
My current cruor balance.;
Resistance outpost status.;
Teleporting to a cavernous maw.;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
The figures in my logbook tell me you have ${number: 0} cruor to your name.${prompt};
Ask about which area?;
${selection-lines};
Abyssea - Vunkerl.;
Abyssea - Misareaux.;
Abyssea - Attohwa.;
Never mind.${prompt};
According to the latest intelligence reports...${prompt};
This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at ${number: 0}%.;
The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is ${number: 1}%.${prompt};
You wish to teleport to a cavernous maw?;
In that case, please tell me your precise destination.${prompt};
Go to which area's gateway?;
${selection-lines};
Abyssea - La Theine.;
Abyssea - Konschtat.;
Abyssea - Tahrongi.;
Abyssea - Vunkerl.;
Abyssea - Misareaux.;
Abyssea - Attohwa.;
Abyssea - Altepa.;
Abyssea - Uleguerand.;
Abyssea - Grauberg.;
I've changed my mind.${prompt};
${number: 1} cruor is required for transport to the gateway to Abyssea - ${choice: 0}[La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].${prompt};
Ah, it seems you have insufficient cruor to make that journey.${prompt};
Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: ${number: 2});
${selection-lines};
Make it so.;
Make it no.${prompt};
These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes.;
Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos.;
Would you be needing something of me?${prompt};
Need something?;
${selection-lines};
Assist with replenishment.;
Assist with upgrades.;
Martellos? Come again?;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort.;
To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} into the structure.${prompt};
Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Take along the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations.;
Best of luck in your efforts!${prompt};
Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?;
You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt};
I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?${prompt};
You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in its stead!${prompt};
Your support is most heartening in these dark times.;
Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.;
You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.;
Be careful out there!${prompt};
Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?;
You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt};
Is that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} I see?;
Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt};
Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.;
How did you fare in your efforts?${prompt};
I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?;
It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt};
The resistance greatly values your contributions.;
Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt};
I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.;
Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt};
Ask something?;
${selection-lines};
So, what's a martello?;
Martello replenishment.;
Martello upgrades.;
Cautionary notes.;
Not now.${prompt};
The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.;
Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt};
You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt};
In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.;
Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt};
That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt};
I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.;
Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.;
Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?;
Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt};
An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.;
Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt};
Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.;
As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.;
Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt};
'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Warning:;
Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.;
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.;
The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.;
Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} breaks!;
Table: ${number: 0};
Very well, friend.;
Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};
Buy something? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).;

Sorry, but our stocks of such sundries are so scarce we can't sell them.${prompt};
Mog Gardens are lovely locales that lie latent in the west, on the Adoulin Islands. They're true treasure troves of taintless resources, frothing with fish, bursting with birds, and filled with forests, kupo!${prompt};
Think of it as your Mog House away from home! Just like that fantastic facility, there's a wealth of wonders just waiting to well up for your disposal.${prompt};
Spread your wings as wide as you wish without worrying about the consequences, kupo. The Green Thumb Moogle will handle the husbandry of this homestead while you're out hacking at hordes of hellions and cavorting across continents.${prompt};
If you're shivering to shove off, then shuffle aboard the Mog Dinghy over there! It may seem small and slightly slipshod, but the mysterious moogle magic we manifest upon it is magnificent enough to move you malms and malms in mere minutes.${prompt};
Once you adjust to your Adoulinian asylum, I'll even proffer printed publications that will make your Mog Garden more majestic. Grab your gil and get ready, kupo!${prompt};
While it'd be wickedly wonderful to whisk away everyone to Mog Gardens, only “Certified Adventurers” and “pioneers” are allowed entry to these excellent expanses of escape, kupo.${prompt};
“Certified Adventurers” are those who have applied themselves assiduously, attaining the third mission rank in any nation.${prompt};
It doesn't have to be here as long as you were once appropriately accredited in times antecedent.${prompt};
If Adoulin's body politic has properly permitted you to perform pioneering duties, however, your so-called “rank” can be lower than a leech's legs and you'll still be let in, kupo.${prompt};
Pleased to meet you, new recruit.;
Is there anything about which you wish to inquire?${prompt};
Inquire about what?;
${selection-lines};
I want to find some quests!;
I want to try the tutorial event!;
Teach me about Records of Eminence!;
Teach me about the Trust initiative!;
I want a map of the area I'm in!;
I want maps of the whole city!;
How do I give items to people?;
How do I fight outside town?;
What are quests and missions?;
Tell me more about Southern San d'Oria!;
I have other questions.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
I can mark the locations of important people on your map of the San d'Oria area, should you require it.${prompt};
You can find a map peddler taking refuge in the shade of a tree to the southwest, near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
There is an elderly woman near the fountain due south of here who will be more than happy to sell you maps.${prompt};
There are people willing to sell you maps in both Northern and Southern San d'Oria, but the vendor in Northern San d'Oria is closer...if you are in a hurry.${prompt};
Our kingdom has prepared a special tour of duty for newly enlisted troops such as you. Hopefully you make the best of it.${prompt};
To begin the journey, simply talk to Alaune in Southern San d'Oria. She resides near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, head directly south and pass through the gate leading to Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, ascend the stairs that lead southwest, which should take you to Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
Once there, proceed southward until you reach Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
I shall mark her position upon your map so you may locate her more easily once you are in that vicinity.${prompt};
It is possible to check who has been marked on your map by opening the “Map” menu, selecting the “Markers” option, and then scrolling to the right.${prompt};
Performing a “Wide Scan” from the “Map” menu also allows you to locate people in your vicinity, should that method prove more convenient.${prompt};
Whether decorated in battle or recently enlisted, all can benefit from trying their hand at Records of Eminence. It is a simple method for participating in Vana'diel's many adventures, and bestows rewards all its own.${prompt};
Open the main menu, go right to get to the next screen, and select “Objective List” under the “Quests” submenu.${prompt};
Select “Tutorial,” head to “Basics,” and accept the objective “First Step Forward” to get started down this magnificent road.${prompt};
Permit me to provide you with a hint for completing “First Step Forward.”${prompt};
Find the person designated by the objective in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark their location on your map.${prompt};
Records of Eminence contains a plethora of objectives, many of which will surely fit your play style. It would behoove you to take advantage of this opportunity.${prompt};
The Trust initiative is a special magic regimen developed by one of the world's finest academies of magic.${prompt};
Those who successfully undergo training will be bestowed with the ability to call forth powerful allies into battle.${prompt};
Only adventurers who have proven their worth by achieving level five are eligible to participate. I will provide you with further information when you reach that landmark.${prompt};
Gondebaud is their representative, and he is stationed in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark his location on your map should you desire to make further inquiries.${prompt};
If you harbor doubts about something I have not yet touched upon, first open the main menu. From there, scroll right to the second page and select the “Help Desk” option.${prompt};
Once you have done that, select “Help Desk” again from the list of categories that appears in the new window. Finally, enter the section entitled “I need help with the game controls.”${prompt};
The answer to your question likely lies there.${prompt};
Though I wish the situation were less dire, there exist many who require your aid.;

“Home points” will probably turn out to be among your best companions. Make sure to examine one if you find it, so you can warp between them and cover large distances fast.${prompt};
You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called “home points” for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.${prompt};
There's some special crystal nodes known as “home points” that'll undoubtedly serve you well. Don't forget to interact with all that you find, as they can help you get to far away places.${prompt};

Rumoie in Southern San d'Oria also fancies herself something of a cartographer. You can always go to her if you want your map marked.${prompt};
The action of handing over objects to others is termed “trading” here. To trade items to people, open the main menu--which will appear on the right-hand side of your screen--and select “Trade.”${prompt};
In the event you have neglected to target your interlocutor, please do so after selecting the “Trade” option. Afterwards, choose the item or items you wish to bequeath in the window that appears and hit “OK.”${prompt};
This process will be an integral part of the quests and missions you shall undertake in the future, so I entreat you to commit it to memory.${prompt};
Should you be in possession of ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, please trade it to me. In return, I shall bestow some monetary remunerations upon you, care of the monarchy.${prompt};
It would behoove you to remember the following points when engaging in combat outside the city gates. One: outfit yourself with weapons and armor. Two: magic spells are learned from scrolls.${prompt};
Thirdly--and of the utmost import--is that you “check” your adversaries before challenging them. It would not do for you to go charging into battle against an enemy who thoroughly outclasses you.${prompt};
Finally, never forget to check your spoils of war.${prompt};
Tasks issued by residents of the city for you to complete are called “quests.” Simply fulfill the requirements, such as procuring the desired item, to receive a reward.${prompt};
On the other hand, orders handed down directly from those involved with the nation's administration are called “missions.” Converse with the guard by the gate for a more detailed explanation.${prompt};
Open the “Map” option from the main menu, select “Markers,” and then scroll to the right. That will tell you where you need to go.${prompt};
Selecting “Map” from the main menu opens the map of the area in which you currently reside. Select “Markers” and press the right arrow key to see all the markers placed on your map.${prompt};

Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt};
Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt};
“Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt};
Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt};
Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt};
Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt};
You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt};
Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt};
The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt};
Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt};
Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt};
“Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt};
These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt};
Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt};
Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt};
A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt};
Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt};
Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt};
When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt};
Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt};
No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt};
You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt};
An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt};
One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt};
A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt};
You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt};
Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt};
Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt};
Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt};
The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt};
It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt};
The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt};
Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt};
These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt};
Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt};
Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt};
You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt};
This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt};
This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt};
However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt};
Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt};
Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt};
Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt};
On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt};
Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt};
Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt};
Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt};
Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt};
A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt};
Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt};
A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt};

I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...${prompt};
Master, look at the orb.${prompt};
You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.${prompt};
This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.${prompt};
Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.${prompt};
Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.${prompt};
In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt};
Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.${prompt};
Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.${prompt};
I've set up shop at this site in search of souls to sell sundries to, kupo! Come back later for some glorious goodies!${prompt};
Come hither, able adventurer! From precipitously perilous peaks to completely creepy caves, I've gathered glorious goodies to sell to one such as yourself!${prompt};
Y-you don't seriously suspect I stole this sumptuous stash through some surreptitious scheme!? I assure you I acquired them on the up-and-up!${prompt};
You won't find frivolous frauds here, only absolutely authentic articles, kupo!${prompt};

No, thank you.${prompt};
Always a pleasure!${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.${prompt};
But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...${prompt};
And I am unable to remain here in 884.${prompt};
My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.${prompt};
Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt};
But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.${prompt};
May your steps remain swift and true.${prompt};
Head for...the palace...${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.${prompt};
But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.${prompt};
I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.${prompt};
If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!${prompt};
Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!${prompt};
Master...forgive me.${prompt};
Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.${prompt};
I'm so hungry...${prompt};
Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?${prompt};
I'm here...${choice: 1}[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...${prompt};
Luzaf...I wish you were here...${prompt};
Please...help me...${prompt};
Razfahd must be stopped...${prompt};
Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...${prompt};
I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.${prompt};
I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.${prompt};
Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.${prompt};
The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt};
Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt};
Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt};
Old gods? New?${prompt};
No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt};
We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.${prompt};
And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.${prompt};
There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.${prompt};
Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt};
And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt};
Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt};
But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt};
For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt};
Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt};
Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt};
It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt};
I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt};
All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt};
An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt};
I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt};
Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt};
I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt};
When I fell before you...${prompt};
...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt};
I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt};
And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt};
This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt};
Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt};
Open your eyes and witness the truth!${prompt};
Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?${prompt};
Is this a dream?;
${selection-lines};
What else could it be?;
No. It's something more...${prompt};
Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt};
A keen eye, as always.${prompt};
The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt};
As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt};
I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt};
And those...${prompt};
...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt};
I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt};
Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt};
And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt};
You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt};
At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt};
Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt};
So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt};
One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt};
Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt};
False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...;
The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt};
Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt};
Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt};
Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”;
Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt};
No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt};
...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt};
You must not. You cannot.${prompt};
Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt};
Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt};
There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt};
You are the culmination of all your experiences.;
Even those who are gone still depend on you.;
${name-player}, this rhapsody is yours to sing.${wait-animation: 3};

Master--the orb.${prompt};
You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.${prompt};
Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.${prompt};
He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt};
I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?${prompt};
What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt};
We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.${prompt};
Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.${prompt};
And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...${prompt};
The future should have changed...${prompt};
...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.${prompt};
Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.${prompt};
And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.${prompt};
