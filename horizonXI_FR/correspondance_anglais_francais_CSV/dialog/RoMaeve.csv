You want to make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.${prompt};
Such a container can be synthesized if you have two ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
And if my memory serves me true, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} serves as the bonding agentaru.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, I hear, can be had within the Maze of Shakhrami. Not lying scattered about the floors, obviously.;
One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.${prompt};
Oh, did I mention ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
Naturally, to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you'll be needing one of those, too.${prompt};
You wish to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe!;
Its creation requires a few ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
In turn, making ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} requires ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Toss ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.${prompt};
I fear we haven't ${item-plural: 0[2]} here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.${prompt};
What brings you here? Well, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, of all things...;
You couldn't hope to make one without some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.${prompt};
But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way.;
Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some ${item-plural: 0[2]}. That's the main ingredient required to make ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
All that remains, then, is to bind it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} using ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Good luck!${prompt};
You... Yes, the description fits.;
I daresay, you're the one “she” sent, yes?${prompt};
Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?${prompt};
At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.${prompt};
Do as he says?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.;
Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.${prompt};
You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will turn ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.${prompt};
I'm currently investigating the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Hm? It appears you are overburdened.;
Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.${prompt};
That is most disappointing...;
“She” would not be pleased to hear of this.${prompt};
Ah, yes...${prompt};
A truly menacing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one each of the ${entity: 1} and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Do you require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}?;
I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Buy for 800 gil? (You have ${number: 3});
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee.;
I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.${prompt};
It appears you haven't enough gil.${prompt};
Ah, a positively imposing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one of the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
I've eagerly awaited your return.;
With this image of the ${entity: 0}, I hold your task fulfilled.${prompt};
As promised, I relinquish this to you.;
Should another be required, you shall find me here.${prompt};
I need images of the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me images of the ${entity: 0} and the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me an image of the ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.${prompt};
I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.${prompt};
Is there something else you wish of me?;
You already have what you came for, no?${prompt};
We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.${prompt};
Putting up a fight, eh?;

“Elite training” is a section of the Field Manual which caters to dauntless adventurers who wish to engage in a more grueling test of their mettle.${prompt};
To participate in elite training regimes, you must acquire chapter transcripts, for which tabs are required.${prompt};
Trading ${item-plural: 35[2]}, gil, or a piece of equipment at designated locations (while in possession of a chapter transcript) will trigger the commencement of your training.${prompt};
Traded items will not be returned to you. You will, however, be furnished with rewards of correlating value upon the successful completion of each elite training regime.${prompt};
Even within elite training, there are regimes of varying difficulty. The trade limit for each succeeding chapter will be greater than the last, and the training objective more challenging.;
For safety reasons, all participants are recommended to be well prepared.${prompt};
Lastly, we at the A.M.A.N. recognize the importance of rest and recuperation as part of a healthy adventuring lifestyle. Therefore, a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all adventurers following the completion of an elite training regime. Until this time has elapsed, you will be unable to undertake further training, even if a chapter transcript is in your possession.${prompt};

Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm!;

What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!?;
Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!${prompt};
There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt};
What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo!;
Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt};
We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.;
But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!${prompt};
There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.;
Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt};
Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo.;
Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.;
It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt};
The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt};
In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.;
Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt};
Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt};
King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.;
How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt};
In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt};
“Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt};
Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.;
A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt};
We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.;
We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt};
Let's see...;
It appears that ${number: 0} moogle ${choice-plurality: 0}[tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.${prompt};

It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, glorious day!;
All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!${prompt};
Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air?;
You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...${prompt};
“Thrifty Transit”!;
A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer!;
For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!${prompt};
“Martial Master”!;
As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!${prompt};
“Blood of the Vampyr”!;
Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!${prompt};
“Treasure Hound”!;
With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!${prompt};
“Artisan's Advantage”!;
Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!${prompt};
“Myriad Mystery Boxes”!;
What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm!;
What genius could have devised such commendable creations?${prompt};
“Dilatory Digestion”!;
Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo!;
Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.${prompt};
“Boundary Buster”!;
Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo!;
It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!${prompt};
“Bountiful Bazaar”!;
Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!${prompt};
“Swift Shoes”!;
This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!${prompt};
“Crystal Caboodle”!;
Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!${prompt};
${prompt};
Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar.;
If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...${prompt};
What? What about the past, you say?;
Of course the magic won't travel through time.;
What a strange question, kupo...${prompt};
But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.${prompt};
The whole system is filled with mysteries.${prompt};
Oh, it's you! It's really you!;
The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!${prompt};
It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo!;
We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts.;
If you'll just sign right here...${prompt};
Sign for the moogle?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
Oh, thank you, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss]...${name-player}!;
A truly heroic name, kupo!${prompt};
As a reward for your efforts, please have this!;
Many thanks, and ${choice: 0}[safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!${prompt};
What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo.;
I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...${prompt};
If you change your mind, come back quickly.;
The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...${prompt};

Bless you twice over, noble heroes, for freeing me from my imprisonment.${prompt};
I'm obliged to inform you, however, that I am not of original temperament.${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
D-Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt};
Th-this courteous display of humility-ethy from the doctor bespeaks foul play!${prompt};
She must have had her personality tampered with...or else been fed rancid rations in captivity-ethy!${prompt};
No, wait, I've had a thought...;
Could it be that Domina Shantotto is not a clone in the strict sense of the word, but, rather, a vessel for all of the doctor's heinous urges?${prompt};
So by that logic, the Shantotto who stands before us, emptied of all wickedness, is the very embodiment of goodness.;
If that's the case, I personally wouldn't mind if things were left as they are.${prompt};
Good sirs, if you wish not for a fate most foul to devour the land,;
that evil, maniacal woman must be stopped, we have to make a stand.;
Evil...? Maniacal...?${prompt};
I daresay-ethy, it rings very strangely in the ears to hear you speak-ethy so of yourself, Doctor.${prompt};
My alter ego lurks the depths of the Toraimarai Canal, at the sacred Full Moon Fountain.${prompt};
'Tis there the seeds of her plan for world domination are sown, of this I am certain.${prompt};
Now with me, friends, we strike for fate.;
Do try to keep up--we mustn't be late!${prompt};
D-Doctor Shantotto! W-wait...ethy!;

Periapt.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};
