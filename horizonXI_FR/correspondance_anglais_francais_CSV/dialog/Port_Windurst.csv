You want to make ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.${prompt};
Such a container can be synthesized if you have two ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;
And if my memory serves me true, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} serves as the bonding agentaru.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, I hear, can be had within the Maze of Shakhrami. Not lying scattered about the floors, obviously.;
One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.${prompt};
Oh, did I mention ${item-plural: 1[2]}?;
Naturally, to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you'll be needing one of those, too.${prompt};
You wish to synthesize ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe!;
Its creation requires a few ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
In turn, making ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} requires ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Toss ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.${prompt};
I fear we haven't ${item-plural: 0[2]} here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.${prompt};
What brings you here? Well, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, of all things...;
You couldn't hope to make one without some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.${prompt};
But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way.;
Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some ${item-plural: 0[2]}. That's the main ingredient required to make ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
All that remains, then, is to bind it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} using ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Good luck!${prompt};
You... Yes, the description fits.;
I daresay, you're the one “she” sent, yes?${prompt};
Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?${prompt};
At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.${prompt};
Do as he says?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.;
Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.${prompt};
You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Using the ${item-singular: 0[2]} will turn ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.${prompt};
I'm currently investigating the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Hm? It appears you are overburdened.;
Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.${prompt};
That is most disappointing...;
“She” would not be pleased to hear of this.${prompt};
Ah, yes...${prompt};
A truly menacing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one each of the ${entity: 1} and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
Do you require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}?;
I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.${prompt};
Buy for 800 gil? (You have ${number: 3});
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Should you not possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee.;
I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.${prompt};
It appears you haven't enough gil.${prompt};
Ah, a positively imposing image of the ${entity: 0}!;
All that remains, then, is one of the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
I've eagerly awaited your return.;
With this image of the ${entity: 0}, I hold your task fulfilled.${prompt};
As promised, I relinquish this to you.;
Should another be required, you shall find me here.${prompt};
I need images of the ${entity: 0}, the ${entity: 1}, and the ${entity: 2}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me images of the ${entity: 0} and the ${entity: 1}.${prompt};
You've yet to bring me an image of the ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.${prompt};
I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.${prompt};
Is there something else you wish of me?;
You already have what you came for, no?${prompt};
We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.${prompt};
Putting up a fight, eh?;
Gorattz! Bompupu! Show ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] what the Tenshodo thinks of meddlesome adventurers!${prompt};
D-damn... I'm in way over my head...${prompt};
Ugh... ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s tougher than ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks...${prompt};
Waaah! I didn't signy-wign up for this...${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Renfred/Gorattz/Bompupu]'s shadow image disappears...${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Skeleton Scuffler/Blest Bones/Holey Horror/Steely Weapon/Lode Golem/Fired Urn] fades away into nothingness...${prompt};
The power of the Great Star Tree has been released!${prompt};
We warmly welcome you to the place of your unmaking.${prompt};
From your ground bones, a loaf of bread we shall be baking.${prompt};
We shall curse you unto death!;
Prepare to breathe your final breath!${prompt};
We will make you beg to die!;
Six fulms under you will lie!${prompt};
Naughty children shall receive no quarter!;
Curl up and die, this is your empress's order!${prompt};
You've long overstayed your welcome!;
The punishment will be brutal and gruesome!${prompt};
Which way do you like it--slow or fast?;
Should you lose a limb, be not aghast!${prompt};
You'll wish you were never born!;
From your torso limbs will be torn!${prompt};
Steel yourself for a wicked fright!${prompt};
We shall set your pants alight!${prompt};
The world shall bow before our might!${prompt};
H-how could this be?;
This outcome, we did not foresee...${prompt};
Be this a dream? Or is it real?;
This ending falls sorely short of ideal...${prompt};
'Twas high time you were made to know;
that your abilities are purely for show.;
O～hohohohoho!${prompt};
A fitting end for a talentless crew;
that tried to bite off more than it could chew.;
O～hohohohoho!${prompt};
Your body absorbs the power held within the ancient runes!${prompt};
You cannot enter this battlefield with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in your possession.${prompt};
It appears you must wait longer to commence the battle.${prompt};
You are not in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Unable to enter the battlefield for “${choice: 1}${choice: 1}[Sugar-coated Directive/Battaru Royale/Project: Shantottofication].”${prompt};
You cannot enter the battlefield for “${choice: 1}${choice: 1}[Sugar-coated Directive/Battaru Royale/Project: Shantottofication]” with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in your possession.${prompt};

It appears you should come back later.${prompt};
You are not in possession of a sap crystal.;

You are not in possession of a Tablet of Hexes.;

The Tablet of Hexes has no effect.;
More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for “Project: Shantottofication.”${prompt};
The door is sealed.${prompt};
Your opponents deem you too weak to be worthwhile, disappearing whence they came.${prompt};
You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...${prompt};
The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!${prompt};
You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!${prompt};
You're done fighting trees, kupo?${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
Hey, you!;
I'll have you know that only the rightful leader of the Star Onion Brigade can sit there! Get down right now before I charge you with trees-on and disturbing the peas!${prompt};
I don't know how you got inside, but that area is off limits. Vacate the premises immediately!${prompt};
He...he...here's your delivery...<wheeze>...!${prompt};
Thanks once again.;
Light on your feet today, I see!${prompt};
Walking trees!? How positively...peculiar.;
Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?${prompt};
I am Melek, the consul of Bastok.${prompt};
Do you know of the Republic of Bastok?;
It is a land far across the seas to the west of Windurst, with a rich mining town as its capital.${prompt};
Windurst, Bastok and San d'Oria fought together in the Great War of twenty years ago and formed a friendly alliance with Jeuno at its head.${prompt};
That is why each country has consulates set up in each other's capitals.${prompt};
......;
What is it you want?${prompt};
Sorry, but I'm not much of a talker. If you have no business with me, then don't speak to me.${prompt};
Bastok is surrounded by a mountain range and has many Galka living in it, so it seems to have the image of an untamed land.${prompt};
But there are romantic spots, such as the view of the drawbridge at sunset. If you are out to make sweet memories in Bastok, you can't go wrong in that area.${prompt};
Hiya! This is the Consulate of Bastok. It's a little piece of Bastok that's like an oasis in the midst of Windurst.${prompt};
Oh, it's not that I dislike Windurst. The beauty of this place is superb, with not a speck of dirt in sight.${prompt};
I guess that's because the Tarutaru line of vision is so close to the ground, that they don't let a single thing that's been dropped slip by them.${prompt};
Befaw the Great War, there weren't nawn of these here consulawtes. So whens yaw went to a fawreign country, yaw felt awl alone.${prompt};
I'm rooly jealous of travelers tawday. If anything happens to them, theys can just go to the nearest consulawte faw help.${prompt};
Oh, you have some business with Consul Melek? Then please head into her office through that door there.${prompt};
I am Melek, the consul of Bastok. I trust you had a safe sail here?${prompt};
So, you are ${name-player}...the one who accepted the cooperative mission to Windurst, I see?${prompt};
Well then, Gold Skull, why don't you start by informing our fair citizen here about what the mission involves?${prompt};
Allow me to explain...${prompt};
The mission from our comrades in Windurst entails the oblation of magic weapons to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};
One of the magic weapons to be dedicated to Giddeus will be handed to you at Heavens Tower, here in Windurst.${prompt};
Your orders are to help carry those magical weapons to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep beneath Giddeus.${prompt};
You look perplexed.;
Yes, well, I guess if you put it frankly, you are carrying a tribute to a pack of beastmen.${prompt};
You see...in order to maintain the peace of their country, the Windurstians have formed amicable relations with the Yagudo.${prompt};
But, as you've probably realized, it's hard to call their relationship amicable when you witness the outrageous behavior of the Yagudo.${prompt};
So we have to try to curtail the beastmen's military potential without losing the trust of Windurst.${prompt};
That's where your real purpose comes in. Gold Skull, please explain the rest of the mission...${prompt};
After receiving the magical weapons from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district, you are to return here to the Consulate of Bastok and present the weapons to us.${prompt};
We will exchange these with a different weapon, which you will take to Giddeus as an offering instead.${prompt};
Do you understand your orders?;
Of course, the fact that we are switching weapons is to remain top secret.${prompt};
We are forbidden from meddling in the internal affairs of another country. However, we wish to save Windurst from its dangerous predicament.${prompt};
Well, you had better get going. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt};
Ask Gold Skull for further explanation if you need clarification. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt};
You are to proceed to Heavens Tower and obtain a shipment of magical weapons. Then you are to return back here to the Consulate of Bastok at once.${prompt};
Once we have switched the weapons, you are to head to Giddeus and offer them to the Yagudo.;
Dismissed!${prompt};
You're wondering what you should do if the Yagudo realize you switched weapons on them, aren't you?${prompt};
Well, that's where your abilities as an adventurer come into play. You should be able to think of something, shouldn't you?${prompt};
The real magical weapons will be shipped back to Bastok, where our soldiers will make far better use of them than the Yagudo ever would.${prompt};
Wait.${prompt};
Take this sword to Giddeus instead.;
Good luck.${prompt};
Take that sword to Giddeus.;
Good luck.${prompt};
Welcome back.;
Your mission went without incident, I trust?${prompt};
We've sent the real magic weapons like the one you brought us, back to our homeland. They'll come in useful for expelling the Quadav from around Bastok.${prompt};
Well, I presume you have to proceed to the Consulate of Bastok in San d'Oria next.${prompt};
It is another long journey to reach San d'Oria. You have to travel from Mhaura to Selbina by boat first, then follow the land route north for quite a way.${prompt};
Don't overdo yourself. Rest up a little before you head to your destination, San d'Oria.${prompt};
I hope to see you safe and well again someday. Take care, ${name-player}.${prompt};
To overdo yourself is to work beyond your natural abilities.${prompt};
Carrying on in such a way will not enable you to give good results. Sometimes you simply need to be kind to yourself.${prompt};
I constantly pray.;
I pray for the future of Bastok.${prompt};
Today I'll also be praying for you to have a safe journey.${prompt};
Those Yagudo didn't take the weapons shipment without giving you trouble, did they?${prompt};
But you were quick-witted and skilled enough to overcome it. That's the way of the true Bastoker.${prompt};
I wonder how long our countries will keep cheating on each other?${prompt};
This whole Yagudo thing got messy because the Windurstians tried to play nice with them...${prompt};
Both our country and Jeuno should tell them straight that this isn't going to get them anywhere.${prompt};
The Windurstians are just being used by the Yagudo.${prompt};
I am Melek, the consul of Bastok.;
I trust you had a safe sail here?${prompt};
So, you are ${name-player}...?;
I heard about your activities in San d'Oria and am expecting great things from you here too.${prompt};
Well then, we should get straight to the matter at hand. Gold Skull, why don't you start by informing our fair citizen here about what the mission involves?${prompt};
Allow me to explain...${prompt};
The mission from our comrades in Windurst entails the extermination of a giant monster that appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};
You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district, and head to the innermost part of Giddeus.${prompt};
Your orders are to then defeat the heinous beast that lurks there.${prompt};
You look perplexed.;
Yes, well, I guess if you put it frankly, you are protecting a pack of Yagudo beastmen from a ferocious monster.${prompt};
You see...in order to maintain the peace of their country, the Windurstians have formed amicable relations with the Yagudo.${prompt};
But, as you've probably realized, it's hard to call their relationship amicable when you witness the outrageous behavior of the Yagudo.${prompt};
But, in order to maintain the trust of Windurst, we have to participate in this preposterousness.${prompt};
Well, good luck with your mission. I look forward to hearing of your success.${prompt};
You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower, here in Windurst, and to defeat the great monster that has appeared in the depths of Giddeus. That's all your country requires from you.${prompt};
Just because the Windurstians are trying to be friends with the Yagudo doesn't mean we should hold back from continuing our fight with the beastmen.${prompt};
Go ahead and savage the brutes, I say! If Windurst puts forward an official complaint, I'll handle it for you.${prompt};
Ask Gold Skull for further explanation if you need clarification. I pray that your mission is a success.${prompt};
You wonder whether something can be done about the amicable relationships between Windurst and the Yagudo? I think it's a hopeless cause, personally.${prompt};
The Tarutaru are like puppets having their strings pulled in the name of “peace.” But then again, it is nice to have peace, even if it is only skin-deep.${prompt};
...!;
The Shadow Lord...!?${prompt};
Wait a moment...;
I'll need you to rush back to the homeland.${prompt};
Here... You understand what you must do? Take this report to the President's Office in Bastok.${prompt};
On your way.;
Please hurry to Bastok!${prompt};
Deliver that report to the President's Office in Bastok.${prompt};
Be on your way then...;

Oh, so you're a foreigner, huh? This is Windurst's Port District.${prompt};

Oh, then this is terrible-werrible.;
Her-hrmm... Allow me to explain...that is, if none of you have any complaints...${prompt};
Gatehouses are meeting and resting points for guards like us who serve and protect Windurst.${prompt};

You underrrstand your instrrructions, don't you? Firrrst you've got to go to the Orrrastery. Don't go to the magic towerrrs of Horutoto Ruins firrrst by mistake.${prompt};Malheureusement, il le pense vraiment...
The Orastery is the ministrrry which rrruns a Mage Academy in the big building by the harborrr. You can see their memberrrs casting magic spell after magic spell towarrrds the sea there.${prompt};Alors fais attention !${prompt}
If you go meet with the Orastery's minister, he will explain the details of the mission to you.${prompt};Que fais-tu à traîner ici sans raison ? C'est une salle d'entraînement pour les sorts magiques. Si tu n'es pas prudent, tu risques de te faire griller... ou pire !${prompt}
He says a lot of nasty stuff...;Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça... ? Oh, maintenant je comprends...
Unfortunately, he means it...;Tu as volontairement accepté de nous aider avec l'expérience magique dans les Ruines de Horutoto, n'est-ce pas ? C'est vrai. Nous avons demandé de l'aide au poste de garde des goons platoon.${prompt}
So watch out!${prompt};Hé, Kuroido-Moido ! C'était l'expérience de pell-mell du ministre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
What are you doing loitering around here all willy-nilly? This is a training room for magic spells. If you're not careful, you'll get fried to a crisp...or worse!${prompt};Oui, le ministre est parti il y a des heures. Il a dit qu'il avait des préparatifs à faire, ou quelque chose comme ça...${prompt}
What's that...? Oh, now I see...;Tsk... <Soupir>
You've volunteered to help us with the magic experiment in the Horutoto Ruins, have you? That's right. We did ask the goon platoon gatehouse for assistance.${prompt};Typique du ministre de demander de l'aide et de partir avant que l'aide n'arrive. Ça a mis cet aventurier pauvre hoddy-doddy dans une situation délicate...${prompt}
Hey, Kuroido-Moido! That was the minister's pell-mell experiment, wasn't it?${prompt};Je sais, je sais...
Yeah, the minister headed off hours ago. Said he had some preparations to do, or something like that...${prompt};Notre ministre est tellement égocentrique. Il ne pense qu'à lui-même...${prompt}
Tsk... <Sigh>;Quoi qu'il en soit, il serait probablement préférable pour toi de te rendre aux tours magiques dans l'Est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
Typical of the minister to ask for assistance and leave before the help comes. That's gone and put this poor hoddy-doddy adventurer out...${prompt};Vraiment ?
I know, I know...;Je ne pense pas que ça importe si ta première impression avec ce vieux prétentieux soit bonne ou non. De toute façon, cela ne te fera pas rentrer dans ses bonnes grâces, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Our minister is so self-centarued. He thinks of nothing but himself...${prompt};De toute façon, dirige-toi vers la tour magique orientale des Ruines de Horutoto. C'est assez loin et un peu dangereux, donc tu voudrais peut-être prendre quelques amis avec toi.${prompt}
Well anyway, it'd probably look better for you to head on over to the magic towers in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Bonne chance !
Really?;(Tu en auras besoin...)${prompt}
I don't think it matters if your first impression with hoity-toity old him is good or not. Either way, it won't get you into his good books, will it?${prompt};Rendez-vous à la tour de magie est des Ruines de Horutoto. C'est assez loin et un tout petit peu dangereux, alors vous voudrez peut-être emmener des amis avec vous.${prompt}
Anyway, head out to the eastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins. It's a fair way, and an itsy-bitsy bit dangerous, so you might want to take some friends with you.${prompt};Le Ministre de l'Orastère ne croit en personne d'autre que lui-même.${prompt}
Good luck!;Il prétend que la philosophie de l'Orastère est que « les forts ne doivent pas compter sur les autres ». Notre ministre n'a aucun scrupule.${prompt}
(You'll need it...)${prompt};Alors, vous avez pu rencontrer notre ministre gaffeur, hein ? Le ministre est revenu il y a un tout petit moment, mais il est reparti tout de suite...${prompt}
Head out to the eastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins. It's a fair way, and an itsy-bitsy bit dangerous, so you might want to take some friends with you.${prompt};Oh, c'est l'Orbe de Mana défectueux...!${prompt}
The Minister of the Orastery believes in nobody but himself.${prompt};Ah, alors c’est vous dont le ministre marmonnait en entrant et sortant d’ici à bout de souffle. Il nous a dit de vous prendre ce vieux ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
He claims the philosophy of the Orastery is that “the strong shouldn't rely on others.” Our minister has no scruples.${prompt};Merci pour votre aide monotone aujourd'hui. Nous attendons avec impatience que vous nous aidiez à nouveau lors de notre prochaine urgence...${prompt}
So you were able to meet our flub-the-dub minister, huh? The minister came back an itty-bitty ago, but was straight out the door again...${prompt};Le ministre fait de son mieux pour réactiver les gadgets farfelus dans les Ruines de Horutoto.

Oh, that's the no-go Mana Orb...!${prompt};Le ministre fait de son mieux pour réactiver les gadgets farfelus dans les Ruines de Horutoto. Tout le monde lui dit que c'est impossible, mais le connaissant, il prouvera probablement que les sceptiques ont tort.${prompt}
Ah, so you were the one the minister was mumbling about when he huff-and-puffingly ran in and out of here. He told us to take the hunk-of-junk ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} off of you.${prompt};Le ministre est très occupé, il est donc impossible de le trouver. L'Académie des Mages est totalement habituée à son absence... en fait, parfois, nous préférons ça ainsi.${prompt}
Thanks for your humdrum help today. We look forward to having you help us again during our next mayday...${prompt};Au fait, avez-vous pu récupérer l'Orbe de Mana fissuré ?${prompt}
The minister is trying his best to reactivate the mumbo-jumbo gizmos in the Horutoto Ruins. Everyone tells him it's impossible, but knowing him, he'll probably prove the naysayers wrong.${prompt};Si c'est le cas, dites-le à mon ami, Hakkuru-Rinkuru, là-bas...${prompt}

The minister is a busy boy, so it's impossible to get a hold of him. The Mage Academy has become totarully used to not having him around...in fact, sometimes we prefer it this way.${prompt};Eh bien, tant mieux pour vous !
By the way, were you able to retrieve the cracked Mana Orb?${prompt};Votre avenir s'annonce prometteur, mon enfant. Une fois que vous aurez réussi avec l'Orastère, vous serez bien parti pour une carrière réussie.${prompt}
If so, then tell it to my buddy, Hakkuru-Rinkuru, there...${prompt};Pourquoi ça, vous demandez ?
Don't tell me this was your first mission?${prompt};Eh bien, disons simplement que nous regardons objectivement vers l'avenir ici à l'Orastère...${prompt}
Well, good for you!;Les forts doivent continuer à regarder vers l'avant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Your future looks bright, kid. Once you've made it with the Orastery, you're well on your way to a successful career.${prompt};Avez-vous apprécié votre mission ? Se porter volontaire pour aider son pays est une cause importante, mais vous ne devez pas oublier de profiter du service que vous rendez.${prompt}
Why's thataru, you ask?;Nous, les Mithra, vivons selon cette politique. C'est pourquoi notre fourrure est toujours si lustrée.${prompt}

Did you know that the formerrr--now deceased--ministerrr of the Manustery invented Cardians to fight in warrr? The currrrent minister is his son.${prompt};Il s'agit d'un voyage à Giddeus. C'est là que vivent les Yagudo, du côté éloigné de Sarutabaruta Ouest.${prompt}
But it seems some of the original Cardians went out of control... I hope the current Minister doesn't repeat his father's mistakes!${prompt};Bien sûr, vous connaissez les Yagudo, n'est-ce pas ? Ils étaient les ennemis contre lesquels Windurst a combattu pendant la Grande Guerre, il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
You should be used to doing missions by now, right?${prompt};Grâce aux efforts de la Sibylle des Étoiles, Windurst entretient actuellement des relations amicales avec eux.${prompt}
Today, I'm thinking of asking you to do a very important mission. Do you think you're up to it?${prompt};Mais cela signifie que nous devons régulièrement leur offrir des cadeaux de nourriture et d'armes.${prompt}
It involves a trip to Giddeus. That's where the Yagudo beastmen dwell, on the far side of West Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Donc, je pense vous faire livrer les prochaines offrandes de nourriture.${prompt}
Of course you know about the Yagudo, right? They were the enemy that Windurst fought against during the Great War, twenty years ago.${prompt};Le Rhinostère est responsable de la préparation des prochaines offrandes. Vous pouvez les récupérer au laboratoire biologique dans le district des Eaux de Windurst.${prompt}
Thanks to the efforts of the Star Sibyl, Windurst currently maintains amicable relations with them.${prompt};Une fois que vous aurez reçu les offrandes de nourriture des chercheurs là-bas, je veux que vous vous rendiez directement à Giddeus.${prompt}
But that means we have to regularly offer up gifts of food and weapons to the Yagudo.${prompt};Enfin, je tiens à souligner que cette mission est très importante. Vos actions pourraient influencer l'avenir de Windurst, alors ne la gâchez pas !${prompt}
So, I'm thinking of having you deliver the next food offerings to them.${prompt};
The Rhinostery is responsible for preparing the next offerings. You can pick them up at the biological laboratory in the Windurst Waters district.${prompt};
Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, I want you to head straight to Giddeus.${prompt};
Finally, I'd like to re-emphasize that this mission is very important. Your actions could influence the future-wuture of Windurst, so don't mess it up!${prompt};
...<phew>;
Did I sound convincingly scary-wary?♪${prompt};
For crying-wrying out loud!;
I told you... First head to the Rhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offerings to be taken to the Yagudo.${prompt};
The Rhinostery is more like a botanical garden than a research institute. It's by far the plainest of the five ministries.${prompt};
So you'rrre finally being sent to Giddeus? That place is confusing, with the paths twisting above and below grrround.${prompt};

This one is much more important than that silly-willy old Rhinostery mission....!${prompt};
...Sorry if I startled you with my sudden-wudden outburst there. I was just informed of an urgent mission from Heavens Tower that is much more suited to the likes of you...${prompt};
This is a task for a true adventurer. And you sure have proved yourself so far...${prompt};
The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what you need to know. I hope you're honored by the privilege of helping out at such an important place.${prompt};
Do you need directions to Heavens Tower? It's on the total opposite side of town from here. You should head northeast via either Windurst Woods or Windurst Waters.${prompt};
Once you find your way inside Heavens Tower, hunt down and ask the secretary about the details of the mission.${prompt};
What Janshura-Rashura didn't tell you is that this mission sounds like it will take a lot of time and efforrrt. You had betterrr preparrre yourrrself for it.${prompt};
If therrre is someone you wish to bid farrrewell to, then don't hold off. It is betterrr to finish things off now, beforrre you leave, than to have them come back and haunt you laterrr.${prompt};

Oh good, I finally-winally found you! We've been searching for you, ${name-player}...${prompt};
We have received a summons for you to appear at Heavens Tower for a special mission.${prompt};
What's more, the summons came from the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna in person. Now that is scary-wary!${prompt};
Mithra have quite a temper, so I recommend you proceed straight to Heavens Tower. See you when you get back!${prompt};
The Sibyl Guards are an elite army corps of Mithra that protects Heavens Tower.${prompt};
I've heard rumors of them, but I've never seen them in the flesh. The job of the Sibyl Guards is to protect Heavens Tower, so it's rare to see them outside of there.${prompt};
I've hearrrd a lot of criticism about Semih Lafihna.${prompt};
While not being in serrrvice to our chieftainness, she is one of our tribal chieftan's favorrrites, so there are a lot of Mithra who resent herrr. If the color of your furrr is differrrent, you're bound to have a harrrd time.${prompt};

Oh, so you're looking for our fudge-mudge minister, are you? Well that is a nippity tippity pity...${prompt};
Our minister came back here a little while ago, but left almostaru right away. He seemed to be preparing for a long journey this time.${prompt};
If he was preparing for a long journey, then he wasn't going to his usual humdrum destination of the Horutoto Ruins, was he?${prompt};
Well, that probably means he's finally ascertained the nitty-gritty whereabouts of the Full Moon Fountain then?${prompt};
Hell's bells...!${prompt};
H-hells bells?;
What's the mattaru, Hakkuru-Rinkuru?${prompt};
...I just remembered, our minister took a caduceus staff with him!${prompt};
That can only mean one thing...!${prompt};
Yes.;
That he's hot-to-trot off to Castle Oztroja!${prompt};
I guess so...;
But why Castle Oztroja?${prompt};
Or more to the point, why would our ding-a-ling minister head off to such a dangerous place as Castle Oztroja on his own?${prompt};
He's been more of an odd bod than usual ever since he found that restricted book that had been lost for decades. Don't tell me he's been cursed by the hocus pocus of that restricted book!?${prompt};
Castle Oztroja is the towering stronghold of the Yagudo king, locatarued deep within the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};
That's our minister for you! Settaruing off alone with nary a single War Warlock, thinking he's all manly... Nothing but recklessness!${prompt};
Were you able to find and hobnob with our minister? It sounds as though he headed off to Castle Oztroja...${prompt};
What? You met him and he was wounded!? Jeepers creepers! That's terrible!${prompt};
I heard, I heard...;
The Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna has given orders to pursue our dear minister.${prompt};
If I were our minister, I certainly wouldn't be coming back to the Orastery. It'd be a waste of time to hang around here.;
It'd be bettaru for you to give up on him, and report back to Heavens Tower.${prompt};
Wow!;
When did you get to be so high-wigh up in the world?${prompt};
This is a mission from Heavens Tower.;
Hmm... That's unusual. The issuer is the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.${prompt};
Well then, please head on over to meet Zubaba. She's rather strict when it comes to punctuality, so for all our sakes, don't keep her waiting!${prompt};
Zubaba, the head lady-in-waiting of Heavens Tower, is asking for you.${prompt};
You must have done an impressive job last time, eh? Looks like you're in their good books, doesn't it?${prompt};
Hurry-wurry on over and meet with Miss Zubaba. Good luck!${prompt};
Gee... I wonder how old the head lady Zubaba really is. She's served at the Star Sibyl's side ever since the current sibyl was a little girl.${prompt};
Ewww!;
What a terrible-werrible thing you have me thinking about!${prompt};
What's that they call the people who serrrve the Starrr Sibyl? “Ladies-in-waiting,” orrr something like that...?${prompt};
They live inside of Heavens Towerrr, so I guess they don't get to go out of therrre very much. Sounds like a pretty borrring life to me!${prompt};

I'm so pleased you were able to get me one. Let me see it...!${prompt};Si j'avais su que c'était si délicat, je n'en aurais pas demandé. C'est impossible pour moi de transporter une chose si fragile chez moi.${prompt}
...Ah!${prompt};On dirait que je dois réfléchir à un autre souvenir à ramener, sinon la petite madame va me tuer. Euh... Laissez-moi voir...${prompt}
Why didn't you tell me that it melts away when you touch it with your bare hands? How am I supposed to carry that home then?${prompt};Maître Sigismund ne fera aucun compromis et ne prendra aucun vieux cadeau pour sa femme. Et si vous avez déjà rencontré la femme, vous ne lui en voudrez pas!${prompt}
But then again, you kept your side of the bargain, and a promise is a promise, so here... Take your reward and leave me be.${prompt};Mais à ce rythme, nous ne pourrons jamais rentrer chez nous. Aaa~h, comme ma famille et mes amis me manquent.${prompt}
If I had known it was that delicate I wouldn't have asked for one. It's impossible for me to carry such a fragile thing back home.${prompt};
Looks like I have to think of some other souvenir to take back, otherwise the little missus is gonna kill me. Umm...

If you catch ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I'd be gratarueful if you gave it to me to check.${prompt};Je pense que les travailleurs ici cuisineront cette fille et la mangeront pour le dîner. Les gens qui travaillent avec la mer ont des estomacs aussi grands que leurs cœurs.${prompt}
Oh, so you caught yourself ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, huh? Let me have a littarule looky-looky...${prompt};À l’extérieur de la ville de Windurst, à travers cette porte, se trouve l’ouest de Sarutabaruta. C’est un endroit dangereux pour le débutant aventurier.${prompt}
Gee... She's not that chubby-wubby, is she. Hmm... We can't expect a good catch just yet.${prompt};Si vous vous perdez, ouvrez votre carte pour vérifier votre position actuelle. Par exemple, en ce moment, nous sommes au coin de la case B-5 de la carte de Port Windurst.${prompt}
Thank you for your cooperation.;Si vous suivez cette route depuis Fishmonger Landing, vous arriverez au poste de garde ouest. Si vous sortez par Shiva's Gate là-bas, vous vous retrouverez dans l'ouest de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
Here...;C'est un endroit idéal pour explorer et un endroit idéal pour se blesser. Avant de sortir, assurez-vous que vos armes et armures sont équipées, et que vous avez les affaires dont vous avez besoin. Vous voulez devenir un aventurier accompli, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
Oh, and I'll hang on to this girl, so let that serve as compensation, all right?${prompt};Vous voulez visiter la Tour des Cieux? C'est juste de l'autre côté de Windurst depuis cette zone portuaire, donc vous devrez monter tout au nord.${prompt}
I'll think the workers here will cook up this girl and have her for dinner. People who work with the sea have stomachs as big as their hearts.${prompt};La Tour des Cieux est un bâtiment qui a été envahi et couvert par un arbre étoilé géant qui est si grand que ses racines sont censées maintenir le monde ensemble. C'est l'endroit le plus célèbre de tout Windurst, donc vous devriez aller jeter un coup d'œil.${prompt}
Outside of the town of Windurst, through this gate, lies West Sarutabaruta. It's a dangerous placey-wacey for the beginner adventurer.${prompt};Le district portuaire, par sa nature même, a beaucoup de gens qui vont et viennent tout le temps, donc les chances de rencontrer de mauvaises compagnies sont plus grandes.${prompt}
If you become lost-wosty, open your map to check your current location. For instance, right now we're on the corner of square B-5 of Port Windurst's map.${prompt};Ne laissez pas la brise marine fraîche vous monter à la tête. Gardez toujours vos esprits!${prompt}
If you head up this road from Fishmonger Landing, you'll come to the western gatehouse. If you head out through Shiva's Gate there, you'll find yourself in West Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Au-delà de cette porte se trouve la zone résidentielle de Windurst, où vous pouvez séjourner dans une Maison de Mog ou Louer-une-Chambre.${prompt}
It's a great place to explore and a great place to get wounded. Before you venture outside, ensure that your weapons and armor are equipped, and that you have the belongings you need. You want to become an accomplished adventurer, don'taru you?${prompt};Si vous avez besoin d'une explication, c'est le travail de Boronene.${prompt}
You want to check out Heavens Tower? It's right on the other side of Windurst from this port area, so you'll have to head way up north.${prompt};Alors prenez votre courage à deux mains, et demandez à Boronene là-bas tout ce dont vous avez besoin de savoir.${prompt}
Heavens Tower is a building that has been overtaken and covered by a giant star tree that is so big, its roots are said to hold the world together. It's the most famous spot in the whole of Windurst, so you should go have a looky-look.${prompt};La soi-disant porte vers les cieux, l'agence de voyage aérien, est là-bas, dans ce bâtiment en face de nous. Vous le voyez, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
The porrrt district, by its very naturrre, has a lot of people coming and going all the time, so the chances of meeting up with bad company is greaterrr.${prompt};Windurst a retrouvé sa paix, alors maintenant, les riches venant d'autres terres viennent nous rendre visite. Si vous leur parlez, ils pourraient vous raconter une histoire ou deux sur ce qui se passe dans le reste du monde.${prompt}
Don't let the frrresh sea brrreeze get to your head. Keep yourrr wits about you always!${prompt};Bienvenue aux Eaux de Windurst !${prompt}
Beyond this gateway is the Windurst residential area, where you can stay in a Mog House or Rent-a-Room.${prompt};AuX★EaUx★dE★WiNduRsT, il Y a l★OpTisTèRe, lE★RhInOsTèRe★et★l'AUraStèRe!${prompt}

This is the super-duper Orastery. Here we run the Mage Academy, which organizes the mages that serve as town guards.${prompt};Soyez prudent maintenant !
If you are looking for our Minister, he's run off on one of his mumbo-jumbo experiments somewhere, and it doesn't look like he's coming back for quite some time. Oo～h, I wish I knew where he went...${prompt};C'est une zone d'entraînement à la magie. C'est bien trop dangereux pour un Monsieur Tout-le-Monde de traîner ici !${prompt}
Either you are extremely brave to entaru such a dangerous place as this...${prompt};Vous pouvez accéder à la zone d'entraînement extérieure depuis l'arrière de la plateforme là-bas, mais l'extérieur est encore plus dangereux qu'ici. Soyez particulièrement prudent si vous vous dirigez là-bas !${prompt}
...or you don't know much about our Mage Academy, do you?${prompt};C'est désespérant !
The guard platoons who protect Windurst at each gatehouse... They're all affiliatarued with our Orastery.${prompt};C'est toujours le même vieux bam-bam et boum-boum sur la même vieille cible d'entraînement Cardian, encore et encore, jour après jour...${prompt}
But they are just simple guards. It's not until they join the War Warlocks that they can feel any real pride in belonging to the Orastery.${prompt};Peu importe à quel point la magie est fantastique ! Si je ne peux l'utiliser qu'ici, alors ce n'est rien de plus qu'un vieux spectacle ennuyeux de feux d'artifice. Oh, comme je veux essayer mes sorts sur de vrais monstres !${prompt}
Be careful, now!;Je, je, je suis un nouvel arrivant à l'Orastere. M-mais mon rêve est d'être comme le grand héros Karaha-Baruha, et de rendre un grand service à mon pays pendant la guerre.${prompt}
This is a magic training area. It's far too dangerous for your average Joe Blow to be hanging around here!${prompt};Vous voyez... Je pense qu'une guerre est sur le point de commencer. E-et beaucoup de gens vont mourir, comme lors de la dernière guerre. Je, je veux empêcher cela de se produire !${prompt}
You can reach the outdoor training area from behind the platform there, but outside is even more dangerous than it is in here. Be especially careful-wareful if you're heading out there!${prompt};Je suis, oh je suis, Ohruru. J'étudie la magie de changement de statut depuis près de vingt-cinq ans maintenant, oh maintenant-maintenant-maintenant.${prompt}
This is hopeless-a-wopeless!;Mais ma recherche est loin d'être terminée, oh terminée-terminée-terminée. Je suis déterminé à continuer à étudier jusqu'à ce que ces yeux voient un état d'altération de l'esprit incroyablement stupéfiant, oh altération.${prompt}
It's just the same old wow-kapow and kaboom-a-boom-boom on the same old dummy Cardian target, over and over, day in and day out...${prompt};Alors écoutez bien...
It doesn't matter how fantastic-a-wastic the magic is! If I can only use it in here, then it is no more than a boring old fireworks display-a-way. Oh, how I want to try my spells out on real monsters!${prompt};Si jamais vous vous retrouvez avec un étrange effet de statut, laissez-le et venez me voir, oh moi-moi-moi !${prompt}
I, I, I'm a newcomer to the Orastery. B-but my dream is to be like the great hero Karaha-Baruha, a-and do a great service to my country during w-war.${prompt};"Il y a plusieurs effets de statut que je paierais cher pour voir, comme, oh disons, ""silence"" ou ""malédiction"", oh malédiction-malédiction-malédiction. Mais c'est plutôt difficile, oh difficile, de trouver un spécimen vivant-vivant-vivant. Teh-heh-heh...${prompt}"
You see...I think a war's about to begin. A-and a lot of people are gonna die, like in the last war. I, I wanna stop that from happening!${prompt};La Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans a été une tragédie lamentable. Tant de brillants guerriers des Sorciers de Guerre de l'Orastery ont été abattus.${prompt}
I am, oh am, Ohruru. I have been studying status changing magic for nigh on twenty-five years now, oh now-now-now.${prompt};Trop est perdu en période de guerre. Même si une véritable paix, la chose la plus précieuse de toutes, est obtenue...${prompt}
But my research is far from over yet, oh yet-yet-yet. I'm determined to keep on studying until these eyes see a mind-numbingly incredible status ailment, oh ailment.${prompt};Il n'y a pas assez de Sorciers de Guerre pour que nous puissions mener une guerre en ce moment. Après tout, cela ne fait que vingt ans depuis la dernière...${prompt}
So listen up-up-up...;Il n'y a pas eu assez de temps pour former des gens compétents, donc nous serions vraiment dans le pétrin si une guerre éclatait soudainement, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
If you ever happen to have a strange status effect cast on you, leave it be and come see me, oh me-me-me!${prompt};Taisez-vous et laissez-moi tranquille !${prompt}
Why, there's a number of status effects I'd pay good money to see, the likes of, oh say, “mute” or “bane,” oh bane-bane-bane. But it's kind of hard, oh hard, to find a living specimen-men-men. Teh-heh-heh...${prompt};J'ai déjà assez de mal à combattre mes propres tendances à la paresse !
The Great War of twenty years ago was a woeful tragedy. So many brilliant warriors of the Orastery's War Warlocks were felled.${prompt};Hi-yah !${prompt}
Too much is lost in times of warfare. Even if true peace, the most precious thing of all, is gained...${prompt};Aa～ah. Peu importe à quel point je m'entraîne chaque jour, mes pouvoirs magiques ne semblent pas s'améliorer. On pourrait penser que la magie s'améliorerait comme par magie, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
There ain't enuff War Warlocks for us to fight a war right now. Afta' all, it's only been twenty -dd years since the last one...${prompt};Pourquoi, c'est exactement comme s'entraîner au combat ou au tir à l'arc ! La magie était-elle censée être ainsi ?${prompt}
There ain't been enuff time to train skilled people, so we'd be in a right proper fix if a war started all o' a sudden, wouldn't we now?${prompt};"Est-ce que les mots ""résistance élémentaire"" vous disent quelque chose ? Comme, plus votre résistance au feu est forte, moins vous subirez de dégâts des sorts de feu, et ainsi de suite... ?${prompt}"
Shut ya mouth and leave me alone!${prompt};Eh bien, ne vous méprenez pas là-dessus. Juste parce que votre résistance au feu est forte, cela ne signifie pas que les sorts de feu que vous lancez sont également forts. Vous comprenez ce que je veux dire ?${prompt}
I'm having enough trouble fighting off me own lazy tendencies as it is!;Pourquoi, oh pourquoi, on dirait que vous avez un petit ennui de santé, ma chère, oh chère-chère-chère !${prompt}
High-yah!${prompt};Écoutez bien...
Aa～ah. No mattaru how much I practice every day my magic powers just don't seem to be improving. You'd think magic would improve like magic, wouldn'taru?${prompt};Je vous paierai une petite somme si vous me laissez essayer de vous guérir.${prompt}
Why, this is just the same as practaruicing fencing or archery! Was magic meant to be like this?${prompt};Laissez le médecin vous soigner ?
Do the words “elemental resistance” mean anything to you? As in, the stronger your resistance to fire is, the less damage you will receive from fire magic, and so on...?${prompt};
Well, don't go getting it wrong, now. Just 'cause your fire resistance is strong doesn'taru mean the fire magic you cast is strong as well. You get whataru I mean?${prompt};Bon eh bien. Autant guérir.
Why, oh why, you look as if you've got a bit of an ailment, dear, oh dear-dear-dear!${prompt};Je vais tenter ma chance ailleurs.${prompt}
Listen up-up-up.;
I'll pay you a small fee if you let me try to cure you.${prompt};Bon, maintenant détendez-vous-ax-ax...${prompt}
Let the physician heal you?;
${selection-lines};
Oh well. May as well get well.;Êtes-vous sûr, oh sûr, que c'est ce que vous voulez vraiment faire-faire-faire ?${prompt}
I'll take my chances elsewhere.${prompt};Hmpf... Votre état était seulement, oh seulement, “silence”. Ce n'était pas du tout un défi-challenge-challenge.${prompt}
Teh-heh-heh.;Voici votre récompense, oh récompense, comme promis. Ma prescription est que vous devriez sortir un peu plus-plus-plus.${prompt}
Okay, now just relax-ax-ax...${prompt};Si vous me demandez, oh moi, vous avez besoin d'un peu plus d'aventures à votre actif-fait-fait.${prompt}
Teh-heh...;
Heh-heh-heh-heh...${prompt};Vous aviez un très bon sort “malédiction” sur vous, oh vous-vous-vous.${prompt}
Are you sure, oh sure, that's what you really want to do-do-do?${prompt};Voici votre récompense, comme promis-ed-ed. Mais si vous me demandez, oh moi, je pense toujours que vous avez besoin de plus de sensations fortes dans votre vie-vie-vie.${prompt}
Hmph... Your status was only, oh only, “mute.” Why that was no challenge at all-all-all.${prompt};Je pense que vous avez besoin d'un peu plus, oh plus, de sensations fortes dans votre vie. Il n'y a pas de temps pour s'amuser une fois que vous êtes parti-parti-parti.${prompt}
Here's your reward, oh reward, as promised. My prescription is that you should get out more-more-more.${prompt};Quelle merveilleuse “épidémie” vous aviez contractée là, oh là-là-là. Vous avez rendu mon travail encore plus excitant-ting-ting.${prompt}
If you ask me, oh me, you need a little bit more adventuring under your belt-belt-belt.${prompt};Voici la récompense, oh récompense, que je vous avais promise-ed-ed. Hé, que diriez-vous de devenir mon cobaye privé--je veux dire--patient ? Je promets des aventures excitantes-ting-ting.${prompt}
${prompt};Devenez mon patient privé et je vous garantis une vie palpitante-tante-tante, oh vie-vie-vie.${prompt}
You had a mighty fine “bane” spell on you there, oh there-there-there.${prompt};Quel (teh-heh) aliment intéressant (teh-heh) vous aviez, oh aviez-aviez-aviez.
Here's your reward, as promised-ed-ed. But if you ask me, oh me, I still think you need a little more thrills and spills in your life-life-life.${prompt};
I think you need a little more, oh more, thrills and spills in your life. There's no time to have fun once your gone, oh gone-gone-gone.${prompt};Comment avez-vous...dit votre (teh-heh) nom déjà ?
What a wonderful “plague” you had contracted there, oh there-there-there. You've made my work all the more exciting-ting-ting.${prompt};${name-player}...? Je n'oublierai jamais ce nom, oh nom-nom-nom. Voici votre récompense, oh récompense.
Here's the reward, oh reward, I promised-ed-ed. Hey, how about becoming my private guine--I mean--patient? I promise thrilling adventures-tures-tures.${prompt};
Become my private patient and I guarantee a thrilling-spilling life, oh life-life-life.${prompt};Vous êtes mon meilleur patient-ent-ent ! Je ne peux pas me permettre de perdre, oh perdre, vous...
What (teh-heh) an interesting (teh-heh) aliment you had, oh had-had-had.;
Teh-heh-heh...${prompt};La guerre consiste à faire une attaque préventive. C'est pourquoi les mages noirs sont cruciaux pour toute guerre.${prompt}
What did...you say your (teh-heh) name was again?;Mais comment vont-ils gagner la bataille s’ils n’investissent pas dans leurs baguettes ? Les mages noirs de nos Sorciers de Guerre ont besoin de ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt}
${name-player}...? I'll never ever forget that name, oh name-name-name. Here's your reward, oh reward.;Plus la guerre est grande, plus le nombre de troupes influence la victoire finale.${prompt}
Teh-heh-heh.${prompt};La vie est une ressource limitée. On ne peut pas simplement créer de nouvelles vies du jour au lendemain, n’est-ce pas ? Pour protéger ces vies précieuses, nous avons besoin de ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}
You are my best patient-ent-ent! I can't afford to lose, oh lose, you...;La magie d’amélioration est comme un renforcement invisible-ble-ble. Elle inflige des dégâts inattendus et peut grandement confondre, oh confondre, votre adversaire, oh adversaire-adversaire-adversaire.${prompt}
Teh-heh-heh...${prompt};Les améliorations des mages rouges équivalent à des dizaines de troupes auxiliaires. Vous voyez donc, oh voyez, nous avons besoin de ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Warfare is all 'bout doin' a pre-emptive strike. That's why black mages are pivotal to any war.${prompt};Je suis dans une situation bien embrouillée !
Yet how'z they to win the battle unless they invest in their wands? The black mages in our War Warlocks need ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};Je suis actuellement en train de préparer le budget pour l'année prochaine, et les capitaines des brigades de mages noirs, blancs et rouges des Sorciers de Guerre me réclament tous plus de financement pour les armes.${prompt}
The bigger the war, the more influence the number of troops has on the final victory.${prompt};Mais comme d’habitude, notre ministre de pacotille s'est volatilisé, donc il n'y a personne ici qui puisse transformer leur fouillis d'opinions en une politique claire.${prompt}
Life is a limited resource. You can't just make new lives straight away, can you? In order to protect these precious lives, we need ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};Je suppose qu’il n’y a pas d'autre choix que pour nous de décider de la juste part par nous-mêmes. Nous sommes chargés des opérations, mais nous ne savons presque rien sur les performances des différentes baguettes qu'ils demandent.${prompt}
Enhancement magic is like an invisible reinforcement-ment-ment. It does unexpected damage and can confuse, oh confuse, your opponent greatly, oh greatly-greatly-greatly.${prompt};J'aimerais mettre la main sur une de chaque type de baguette et comparer leur performance déterminante jusqu'à ce que tout le monde soit d'accord sur les meilleures baguettes. Si seulement quelqu'un pouvait m'aider à les obtenir...${prompt}
The power-ups of the red mages are equivalent to dozens of auxiliary troops. So you see, oh see, we need ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};Wanda aider ?
I'm in such a helter-skelter fix!;
I'm currently preparing the budget for next year, and the captains of the black, white, and red mage brigades of the War Warlocks are all squeezing me for more arms funding.${prompt};Oui, ce serait merveilleux !
But as usual, our flub-the-dub minister has gone AWOL on us, so there's no one here who can form their hodgepodge of opinions into a clear-cut policy.${prompt};Non. Éloignez-vous.${prompt}
I guess there's no choice but for us to decide the fair share on our own. We are in charge of operations, but know next to nothing about the performance of the various handy-dandy wands they are requesting.${prompt};Pourquoi... merci beaucoup pour cette offre très agréable ! Juste une de chaque type de baguette serait suffisante pour que nous puissions les essayer. Je compte sur vous, as du volant !${prompt}
I'd like to get my hands on one of each of the three types of wands and compare their make-or-break performance until everyone agrees on which wands are best. If only someone would help me obtain them...${prompt};Demandez au vieux schnock à la tête de chaque brigade des Sorciers de Guerre les noms des trois baguettes. Oh, et assurez-vous d'obtenir vos propres baguettes dernier cri pour nous donner. Ne nous donnez pas de baguettes empruntées à d'autres, maintenant !${prompt}
Wanda help?;Mais quelle poule mouillée !
${selection-lines};Tourner le dos à une personne dans le besoin. Sainte vache...${prompt}
Yes, it'd be wanderful!;Je suis actuellement en train de préparer le budget pour l'année prochaine, et les vieux schnocks capitaines des brigades de mages noirs, blancs et rouges des Sorciers de Guerre me réclament tous plus de financement pour les armes.${prompt}
No. Wander away.${prompt};Je n'ai d'autre choix que d'obtenir un de chaque type des trois baguettes qu'ils veulent, et de comparer leur performance décisive. Alors, s'il vous plaît, procurez-moi un de chaque type de baguette.${prompt}
Why...thank you so very much for the nicey-nice offer! Just one of each kind of wand would be enough for us to try out. I'm counting on you, hotshot!${prompt};J'aimerais dire que nous pourrions vous rendre vos baguettes après avoir terminé les tests de comparaison des performances...${prompt}
Ask the fuddy-duddy head of each brigade of the War Warlocks for the names of the three wands. Oh, and make sure you obtain your own hipper-dipper wands to give us. Don't go giving us wands that you borrowed from others, now!${prompt};...Mais le problème est que nous ne pouvons pas garantir que les baguettes survivront au processus de testaruation en un seul morceau !${prompt}
Why, you hoddy-doddy!;Assurez-vous de nous obtenir une de ces baguettes que veut le général de brigade des mages rouges !${prompt}
Turning your back on a person in need. Holy moley...${prompt};Si le régiment de mages rouges obtient plus de baguettes, alors peut-être, juste peut-être-a-waybe, j'obtiendrai une meilleure baguette de seconde main !${prompt}
I'm currently preparing the budget for next year, and the fuddy-duddy captains of the black, white, and red Mage brigades of the War Warlocks are all squeezing me for more arms funding.${prompt};J'espère que la brigade de mages noirs des Sorciers de Guerre obtiendra ce qu'ils espèrent.${prompt}
I have no choice but to obtain one of each of the three types of wands they want, and compare their make-or-break performance. So, please get me one of each type of wand.${prompt};<marmonnement-babillage>...
I'd like to say that we could give you your wands back after we finish the performance comparison tests...${prompt};A-assurez-vous d'obtenir une meilleure baguette pour les mages noirs que pour les autres, d'accord ?${prompt}
...But the problem is, we can't ensure the wands will survive the testaruing process in one piece!${prompt};En fait, les trois types de baguettes que veulent les généraux de brigade devraient être stockés dans le dépôt de l'Orastery...${prompt}
Make sure you get us one of those wands the red mage's brigadier general wants!${prompt};Oh, mais lors des réunions budgétaires de l'année dernière, ils ont pillé le dépôt et sont devenus fous avec, donc, euh, je suppose que c'est pourquoi ils vous demandent d'apporter de nouvelles baguettes.${prompt}
If the red mage regiment gets more wands, then maybe, just maybe-a-waybe, I'll get a better hand-me-down wand!${prompt};Yabba dabba, c'est absolument fantastique ! Vous avez réussi à obtenir les trois baguettes que nous voulions. Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
I, I hope the black mage's brigade of the War Warlocks get what they hope for.${prompt};Oh-oh ! Votre timing est mauvais...
<mumble-wumble>...;Le docteur Shantotto est venu rendre visite et est actuellement à l'arrière...${prompt}
M-make sure you get a better wand for the black mages than you get for the others, okay?${prompt};Oh, quelle synchronisation magnifique, mes chers.${prompt}
Actually, the three types of wands the brigadier generals want should be in storage in the Orastery's depository...${prompt};Oh-hohoho !${prompt}
Oh, but during last year's budget meetings they raided the depository and went wild with them, so, erm, I guess that's why they are asking you to bring-wring them new ones.${prompt};Hohoho ! Est-ce la première fois que nous nous rencontrons ?
Yabba dabba, this is absolutely wand-erful! You managed to obtain the three wands we wanted. Thank you very much!${prompt};Je suis l'ancien ministre de cet Orastery, le docteur Shantotto.${prompt}
Oh-oh! Your timing is bad...;Pourquoi, Hakkuru-Rinkuru, mon cher !
Doctor Shantotto has come to visit and is out back right now...${prompt};Ne s'agit-il pas des baguettes que nos généraux de brigade vous réclament que vous avez ici ?${prompt}
Oh, what splendid timing, dears.${prompt};Laissez-moi les emprunter, Hakkuru-Rinkuru.
Oh-hohoho!${prompt};Ohoho ! Je vais les essayer et décider pour vous !${prompt}
Hohoho! Is this our first time to meet-o?;Tout d'abord, nous avons le ${item-singular: 1[2]}...
I'm the previous minister of this Orastery, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt};
Why, Hakkuru-Rinkuru, my dear!;
Aren't those the wands our brigadier generals are pushing you for that you have here?${prompt};Eh bien, c'était si si...${prompt}
Let me have a lend of them, Hakkuru-Rinkuru.;Ensuite, nous avons le ${item-singular: 2[2]}...
Ohoho! I'll try them out and decide for you!${prompt};
First off, we have the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...;Maniable mais la direction est un peu rugueuse...${prompt}
Bibbly-bobbly-boo-boo～!${prompt};Enfin, nous avons le ${item-singular: 3[2]}.
Humph.;Mumbo-jumbo moogle-mambo !${prompt}
Well, that was oh so so-so!${prompt};Oi... !${prompt}
Next we have the ${item-singular: 2[2]}...;Oi !
Alakaza～m...${prompt};Tout va bien ?${prompt}
Handles nicely but the turning is a little rough...${prompt};Nom d'une pipe !
Finally we have the ${item-singular: 3[2]}.;C'était une situation critique !${prompt}
Mumbo-jumbo moogle-mambo!${prompt};Si le ministre Ajido-Marujido n'était pas arrivé juste au bon moment, tu serais en route vers le paradis en ce moment, mon pote.${prompt}
Oi...!${prompt};Ne me blâme pas. Non, oh, non !
Oi!;Un tel faible ne devrait pas être à l'Académie des Mages pour commencer ! Ohoho !${prompt}
Are you okay?${prompt};Docteur Shantotto !${prompt}
Jeepers creepers!;Ohoho !
That was a close call!${prompt};Eh bien, je me retenais, tu sais.${prompt}
If Minister Ajido-Marujido hadn't turned up justaru at the right moment, you'd be on your way to heaven right now, pal.${prompt};
Don't blame me. No, oh, no!;Ne sois pas fâché, maintenant. Ne sois pas en colère.
Such a weakling shouldn't be in the Mage Academy to begin with! Ohoho!${prompt};C'est une expérience rare--voir le ministre Ajido-Marujido et moi nous égaler en magie--comme celle que tu viens d'avoir.${prompt}
Doctor Shantotto!${prompt};Tiens, je te donne ceci, mon ami...
Ohoho!;Ça devrait te fournir des heures de plaisir pour ton week-end. Ohohoho～ !${prompt}
Well, I was holding back, you know.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Don't be angry, now. Don't be mad.;
It is a rare experience--to see Minister Ajido-Marujido and I match each other in magic--like that you've just had.${prompt};
Here, I'll give you this, my friend...;
It should provide you hours of fun on your weekend. Ohohoho～!${prompt};
So, what was it you were trying to do in my absence?${prompt};
Wouldn't your time be better spent improving your magic abilities rather than playing in a magic competition?${prompt};
The brigadier generals of the War Warlocks have been pushing me to budget for their own equipment preferences, so I was trying to test these three different wands, and decide which to buy...fair and square!${prompt};
You should be the one to decide, Minister Ajido-Marujido! That way everything will be settaruled peacefully.${prompt};
You're talking about next year's budget, rightaru?${prompt};
Oh, I've already placed the orders with Jeuno. I bought swords, axes, armor, shields...${prompt};
Hold on a second, Minister! None of those bric-a-brac can be used by mages, can they???${prompt};
Hahaha, I bought them for you boys in Operations, silly! Anyway, that should keep you busy working on them for a while. See you around, boys. Ta-taru.${prompt};
He's buying up weapons and armor from other countries for us to study in order to improve our strategic skills, I guess.${prompt};
But wouldn't that suggest a possibility of antagonizing these other countries...? Don't tell me our Orastery staff have to read that far into the mattaru...?${prompt};
Okey-dokey. Now I see... The minister finally understands the importance of our Operations section. Some may think such learning is expensive, but the cost of ignorance can be much greater.${prompt};
But getting back to where we were...;
I'm sorry, but it seems we broke one of your wands. Here, please take this as an itsy-bitsy token of our regrets...${prompt};
If that's the minister's policy, there ain't much we can do, is there?${prompt};
Let 'im flower the Operations Division with resources this time. In large-scale warfare, a superior strategy can turn the status of the battle around one-eighty degrees.${prompt};
What to do with Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt};
On the occasions that she does drop in on the Orastery, she annoys the heck out of us, then leaves. But I guess that's what makes Doctor Shantotto Doctor Shantotto.${prompt};
Hah!;
I'm not the least bit upset, oh upset-upset-upset...${prompt};
It's only a matter of time before each battle is won, oh won-won-won. It's like poison, slowly wearing you down as each moment passes-es-es.;
Teh-heh-heh...${prompt};
Doc Shantotto's one scary-a-wary granny!${prompt};
Quite a number of my predecessors have whamming-a-bamming fallen victim to her screwball acts.${prompt};
Oh, wow!;
I, I got to see the great Doctor Shantotto's magic firsthand!${prompt};
During the war years, as the previous minister here, it was her magic powers that determined our very survival. She, she is more than just my heroine, she's my goddess!${prompt};
Enjoy the little magic show there? Doc Shantotto's always unleashing her mighty magic on anyone and everyone without mercy.${prompt};
That's how we lose more than the odd wand or two... My head hurts at the thought-wought of all the equipment she's wasted so far!${prompt};
Heeber-jeebers!${prompt};
Whoa! You scared the wits out of silly-billy me. I thought you were Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt};
You see...the true-blue truth is... I kinda snapped the minister's favorite wand into two.${prompt};
I was just discussing with Kuroido-Moido how we can pull a rigajig swifty on the minister!${prompt};
I never said we should pull a swift one on him! Acts of badness will always come to light eventarually, you know? Besides, you were the one who suggestarued it first, Hakkuru-Rinkuru!${prompt};
We've already hurried-scurried and ordered a new wand. Keeping it quiet until the replacement comes isn't an act of badness, is it?${prompt};
In sticky situations like this, I've heard that if you have an ooey-gooey ${item-singular: 1[2]} you can glue a broken wand back together again.${prompt};
My hotshot adventurer!;
I'll pay you a handsome ransom if you can go find me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Agree to help fix the stick?;
${selection-lines};
Yes. Stick together!;
No. Stick it out!${prompt};
Wand-erful!;
I'm counting on you, so stick to it!${prompt};
I'm stating this for the record, but I am having no partaru in this!${prompt};
Heeber-jeebers!${prompt};
If only I had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I could mend the broken wand...or so the local armorer maintains...so it must be true!${prompt};
It seems that the zoot-snoot Goblins in Tahrongi Canyon often carry them. One should be enough, so please go find me one!${prompt};
I'm stating this for the record, but I am having no partaru in this!${prompt};
We shouldn'taru have tried to clean the minister's important wand to begin with! He always told us not to touch the wand's case!${prompt};
Whoa! Heebee jeebees! You're just in time! We just heard word that the minister is on his way back now.${prompt};
Thanks. You're the bee's knees!;
Here's your handsome ransom, in lieu of hush money. Now I've got to hurry and fix this wand!${prompt};
I've got to hurry-scurry and fix this wand before the minister gets back!${prompt};
I wonder why the minister places such importarunce on that wand? It doesn't look like it has any particular value.${prompt};
Whoa! Holy moley!;
Major depression.${prompt};
Let me explain why Hakkuru-Rinkuru is so down in the dumps...${prompt};
You remember the little incident where he accidentarully broke the minister's wand, don'taru you? He was able to pull the wool over the minister's eyes up until he replaced the wand with a new one.${prompt};
But our minister knows his stuff! Seems the minister took one look at the new wand, realized it had been switched, and gave Hakkuru-Rinkuru a right royal telling off!${prompt};
No, Kuroido-Moido, you got it wrong!;
He didn't get an itty-bitty bit angry with me at all, even though he had every right... That's why I am so depressed!${prompt};
You've got me confused. What's the problem then?${prompt};
We all very well know Minister Ajido-Marujido's hoity-toity sarcastic personality. But he didn't even spare me a single sarcastic remark.${prompt};
He just went all quiet and huffed off all of a sudden. I bet he had such ill will he couldn't express himself in words!${prompt};
Wha-a～aaa!;
I'm going to be fired for sure after this hubbub!${prompt};
Hmm...It is just as I feared.;
That wasn'taru just your average wand we were dealing with there. It wasn'taru something that you could replace by simply buying a new one.${prompt};
You sent the old wand off to the magic incinerator, rightaru? I wonder if they've already incinerated it?${prompt};
Waa～a! I'm such a ding-a-ling! I'm going to be fired for sure this time!${prompt};
It seems my colleague sent the old wand off to the magic incinerator in Garlaige Citadel.${prompt};
It's probably too late to save it from being burnt to a crisp...${prompt};
Hmm... Looks like you saved the day. This is undeniably our minister's original wand.${prompt};
Looky here, Hakkuru-Rinkuru! Seems the wand hasn't been “fired,” so neither will you...${prompt};
Woohoo! What a cheerful earful! I'm not going to be fired after all!${prompt};
There, there...;
Now all we have to do is wait for the minister to come back...${prompt};
Hi-diddly-diddly! Is my dear brother in?${wait-animation: 1};
Ah...Miss Apururu!${prompt};
Hidey-hi!;
Hmm... Looks like brother dearest is away as usual. That is so typical of him!${prompt};
What's the emergency, Miss?${prompt};
No emergency...;
But today, a pile of Cardian weapons were suddenly delivered to my door from none other than our dear Ajido-Marujido...${prompt};
I recall saying that I was in a jam because we didn't have enough money to buy weapons for our Cardians, but I don't remember asking him to buy us any!${prompt};
Don't you think it is kind of strange? It is very unlike him to suddenly do something like that for no reason. So, I was wondering what has gotten into him...?${prompt};
Oh, goodness-woodness...;
That wand you have there...${prompt};
Now this brings back memories! This is the wand that my brother and I had fought over so much when we were children. It wound up broken in two!${prompt};
Not that we were the ones to break it, mind you. Our mother, Goddess bless her soul, was the one who snapped it!${prompt};
She meant to teach us the lesson that when two people fight over something, it will surely get broken...${prompt};
I can't recall ever being so frightened of our mother...${prompt};
Wowie-zowie!;
Sounds like she was a scary woman when she wanted to be.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Well, anyway, I had best get back to my own ministry. When my brother returns, tell him I said “thank you.” Ta-ta～ru, everyone!${prompt};
Although it's an incy-wincy bit hard to believe at times, our minister and Miss Apururu really are brother and sister...${prompt};
But, hey... Jeezy-peezy!;
Doesn't that mean the wand was broken to begin with?${prompt};Il y a beaucoup de choses que tu ne sais pas sur ce monde jusqu'à ce que tu ailles voir par toi-même...${prompt}
Now I get the picture...;Notre papa est marin, alors ma sœur et moi attendons le retour du bateau de papa.${prompt}
When our minister saw the wand that Hakkuru-Rinkuru had fixed with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, he must have thought his dear mother was trying to tell him something!${prompt};Ma maman nous a dit de ne pas parler aux étrangers...et tu es certainement plus étrange que la plupart des gens!${prompt}
But if that's the case, then...;Paytah, espèce d'idiot!
If we don't stick this wand back together again, they'll return to being the fightaruing siblings that they originally were.${prompt};Maman ne t'a-t-elle pas dit de ne pas parler aux étrangers? Ne viens pas pleurer si tu as des ennuis!${prompt}
Hmm...${prompt};Je suis dans le pétrin! Le vent a emporté le chapeau de papa dans la mer.${prompt}
There's a lot of things you don't know about this world until you actually go see for yourself...${prompt};Papa va être tellement en colère!
Our daddy's a sailor-man, so sis and I are waiting for daddy's ship to come back.${prompt};Je vais me faire gronder!
My mommy told us not to speak to strangers...and you sure are stranger than most!${prompt};<sniff> <sniff> Ouaaah!${prompt}
Paytah, you dummy!;Tu mérites ce qui t'arrive, espèce de pleurnichard! Papa ne pourra peut-être pas partir sans ce chapeau!${prompt}
Didn't mommy tell you not to speak with strangers? Don't come crying to me if you get in trouble!${prompt};
I'm in big trouble! The wind blew my daddy's hat into the sea.${prompt};
Daddy's gonna be so angry!;
I'm gonna get a walloping!;
<sniff> <sniff> Waaaaaah!${prompt};
You deserve whatever you get, you little crybaby! Daddy might not be able to set sail without that hat!${prompt};
No! <sob>;
Don't say that! Nooooo! <sob>;
Waaahaaaaa～aah!${prompt};
Thank you ${choice: 0}[Miss/Mister]!;
But... Oh, no... It's...it's...all tattered and torn...!? Uh-uh...${prompt};
Waaaaa～aah!!!${prompt};
Waaaaha～aah!!!${prompt};
Oh, no! Daddy's cap is all torn up!;
Paytah's gonna get a real hiding!${prompt};
Oh...wow!!!;
It's as good as new!;
Great!;
Now daddy can go sailing again!${prompt};
Phew... Saved!;
Here, you can have this...${prompt};
Thank you!;
Now my daddy can go sailing again!${prompt};
Oooh!;
I'm so glad!;
Yahooo!${prompt};
Eww, Paytah!;
Your nose is running!;
You dirty little goober!${prompt};
Ah...! Thank you!;
Now my daddy can go sailing again.${prompt};
But, wait...?;Voici l'entrée de la zone résidentielle de Windurst. À l'intérieur, des Maisons Mog sont disponibles pour les citoyens de Windurst.${prompt}
This isn't my daddy's cap...?${prompt};Ooh... Quelle drôle de tête tu fais! Ne me dis pas que tu ne sais pas ce qu'est une Maison Mog. Eh bien, laisse-moi t'expliquer!${prompt}
Don't you go taking something that doesn't belong to you! I'll tell mommy on you, and mommy will get real angry!${prompt};Écouter l'explication sur les Maisons Mog?
Uh...here...;
Take it back!;
<sob>...Waaaaa～aah!!!${prompt};
This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt};Une Maison Mog est votre propre appartement personnel, fourni pour votre commodité.${prompt}
Ooh... What a strange facey-wacey you're making! Don't tell me you don't know what a Mog House is. Well then, allow me to explainy-wainy!${prompt};Dans votre Maison Mog, vous pouvez effectuer des activités telles que le stockage d'objets, le changement de métier et la guérison des PV et PM.${prompt}
Listen to Mog House explanation?;En tant que citoyen de Windurst, une Maison Mog est déjà préparée pour vous en haut des escaliers derrière moi.${prompt}

Yes.;Voici l'entrée de la zone résidentielle de Windurst. À l'intérieur, des Maisons Mog sont disponibles pour les citoyens de Windurst.${prompt}
No.${prompt};Voulez-vous entendre à nouveau mon explication sur les Maisons Mog?${prompt}
A Mog House is your own personal apartment room, provided for your convenience.${prompt};Eh bien, au revoir et à bientôt!${prompt}

As you are a citizen of Windurst, you already have a Mog House prepared for you up the stairs behind me.${prompt};Hmm...laisse-moi voir...

Do you want to hear my explanation of Mog Houses again-wainy?${prompt};Quitter votre Chambre-à-louer?
Well then, bye-bye and ta-taru!${prompt};
This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt};
Hmm...let me see...;
I believe you currently have a Rent-a-Room leased in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], rightaru?${prompt};Okey-dokey... Considère que c'est fait!
Shall I move you out of the Rent-a-Room in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi] and have your belongings brought back here to your Mog House in Windurst?${prompt};J'ai résilié votre Chambre-à-louer à ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi].

Move out of your Rent-a-Room?;Voici l'entrée de la zone résidentielle de Windurst. À l'intérieur, des Maisons Mog sont disponibles pour les citoyens de Windurst.${prompt}
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Vous avez déjà loué une Chambre-à-louer ici, donc vous êtes libre d'entrer quand bon vous semble.${prompt}
No.${prompt};Voici l'entrée de la zone résidentielle de Windurst. À l'intérieur, des Maisons Mog sont disponibles pour les citoyens de Windurst.${prompt}
Okey-dokey... Consider it done!;Oh... Euh...?
I have returned your Rent-a-Room in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi]. You are free to use your Mog-House here againy-wainy.${prompt};Excusez-moi, mais vous n'êtes pas citoyen de Windurst, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt};Pas de souci... Pas de souci...
Oh...?;Nous pouvons aussi prêter des chambres aux personnes d'autres pays. Nous les appelons simplement Chambres-à-louer, mais elles sont presque les mêmes que les Maisons Mog.${prompt}
You already have a Rent-a-Room leased here, so you're free to enter as you please.${prompt};Louer une Chambre-à-louer?
This is the gateway to Windurst's residential area. Inside, there are Mog Houses available for use by citizens of Windurst.${prompt};
Oh... Um...?;
Excusey-wusey me, but you're not a citizen of Windurst, are you?${prompt};
Not to worry... Not to worry...;Okey-dokey... Considère que c'est fait!
We can lend rooms out to people from other countries too. We just call them Rent-a-Rooms, but they are nearly the same as Mog Houses, anyway.${prompt};J'ai attribué une Chambre-à-louer pour votre usage dans la zone résidentielle de Windurst. Vous êtes libre de commencer à l'utiliser quand bon vous semble.${prompt}
Lease a Rent-a-Room?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Okey-dokey... Consider it done!;
I have assigned a Rent-a-Room for your use inside Windurst's residential area. You are free to start using it whenever you see fit.${prompt};
What in Windurst is going on? The airship from Jeuno arrived hours ago, but our flub-the-dub minister is nowhere to be seen.${prompt};
What's the matter with him? It's been weeks since he suddenly upped and left us in a helter-skelter.${prompt};
And when he finally sends us a teensy-weensy message, it just reads, “I have a lot of luggage, so come meet me at the airship port!”${prompt};
Our Minister of the Orastery has an amazing gift of forgettaruing and breaking promises.${prompt};
Why, he's probably even forgottaruen that he sent us a message to begin with!${prompt};
Oh bother-wother!;
The Orastery would get on fine without him, but his niminy-piminy sister, Apururu, is the trouble. No one can stand her loud mouth.${prompt};
I think it's because she's so annoying that the minister is always absentaru.${prompt};
Ahhh...;
The way things are going, I wonder whether our minister can really save Windurst...${prompt};
Uh-oh! Jeepers creepers! Here comes that Sibyl Guard again...${prompt};
I bet it's got to do with the minister again. I suggest we get out of here before she asks us all sorts of questions and gets us into trouble.${prompt};
Yes. A quick getaruway is in order.${prompt};
What's the matter, my adventurer frrriend? Overwhelmed by the size of this fine city?${prompt};
By the looks of it, you've only just arrived in Windurst, rrright?${prompt};
Are you new to Windurst?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
How do you like it? Windurst is a land of peace and beauty.${prompt};
Unlike those other two countries which are busy spilling needless blood as they fight forrr no gain...${prompt};
Well then, you also well know that Windurst is a land of peace and beauty.${prompt};
Unlike those other two countries which are busy spilling needless blood as they fight forrr no gain...${prompt};
I am Semih Lafihna.;
I am a perrrsonal guard to the Star Sibyl, who presides over the lands of Windurst.${prompt};
If you intend on settling in Windurst, feel free to ask me forrr advice. Is there anything you want to know?${prompt};
Ask for advice on...;
${selection-lines};
How to go outside and battle.;
Where to shop.;
How to gain information.;
Where am I? Who am I?${prompt};
I wouldn't recommend running strrraight out to battle, but if you are confident of your abilities, I won't stop you.${prompt};
If you climb up to the top of this rrroad, it should lead you to the western gatehouse.${prompt};
Pass through Shiva's Gate to go outside to West Sarutabaruta. The outside world is full of ferrrocious monsters, so you'll have to fend for yourself.${prompt};
I'm sure you know this already, but before you pick a fight, you should “check” your opponent! Try not to pick a fight with a foe you cannot defeat.${prompt};
Grrr...?;
Look what the cat just drrragged in...${wait-animation: 1};
I'm sorrrry to have to cut our conversation short, but I have to run now...${prompt};
Ask the Jack of Clubs if there's anything else you need to know. He's the Cardian nearrr the Orastery entrance.${prompt};
If you trade him this, he'll give you a rewarrrd. You do that by targeting Jack, then selecting “Trade” from the main menu.${prompt};
Well, do your utmost for the sake of the peace of Windurst and the Star Sibyl. If you do, I'm surrre we'll cross paths again.${prompt};
Shopping...?;
Port Windurst, wherrre we are presently, has the most shops out of all of Windurst.${prompt};
Down along the shore there's a pier where three boats are wharved in a rrrow.${prompt};
The boat closest to shore houses Kususu's Hoodoos, a magic store. It's perrrfect if you want to buy all the initial magic spells.${prompt};
The other two boats house Hohbiba-Mubiba's Wands of Wonder, and Guruna-Maguruna Tailoring.${prompt};
Both magic users and the non-magically inclined alike should be able to fulfill most of their equipment needs therrre.${prompt};
You'll need plenty of gil if you want to purrrchase the stronger equipment. Monsters you defeat will drop various spoils. I suggest you sell them to increase your gil.${prompt};
Oh, and on the western docks is the Fishermen's Guild. You can buy any fishing supplies you need there.${prompt};
I can only pass on to you the rumorrrs that I know...${prompt};
So, if you don't mind acting on hearsay, then here goes. What kind of inforrrmation are you interested in?${prompt};
Ask for information on...?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Monster patrol.;
Easy money.;
Looking for work.${prompt};
I don't know whether you can call it helping people or not, but you might like to inquire at the Manustery.${prompt};
The Manustery goes from one harrrdship to another. They can always do with a helping hand.${prompt};
Oh, the Manustery's Cardian laboratory is in the predominantly Mithra suburrrb known as Windurst Woods.${prompt};
Follow that road until you reach the air trrravel agency, turn left and you'll see an arrrch that leads to Windurst Woods.${prompt};
I'll let you find out what Carrrdians are by yourrrself. Heh-heh-heh.${prompt};
Actually, when you meet the Minister of the Manustery, Apururu, I should get you to ask her when the Minister of the Orrrastery is due ba...${prompt};
By “easy money,” I prrresume you mean jobs that give you gil without having to battle monsters for it?${prompt};
Then try the hatter in Windurst Waters. The proprietorrr always has some harebrained scheme he wants help with.${prompt};
To get to Windurst Waters, follow this rrroad back up there...${prompt};
If I recall, Illu Bohjaa, the dhalmel farmer, has been asking for help in reducing the number of crawlers in these parts.${prompt};
The dhalmel farm is in the neighboring suburb, Windurst Woods. To get there, follow this road straight ahead and pass through the north arch.${prompt};
If it's work you're looking forrr, go to one of the gatehouses.${prompt};
The nearest gatehouse is right therrre, back up that slope behind you.${prompt};
Gatehouses are special places that hand out missions on behalf of the Federation of Windurst.${prompt};
As you complete missions obtained from the gatehouses, yourrr rank points will increase.${prompt};
Collect enough rank points and yourrr rank, or position within this country, will rise. You're currently rank one, by the way.${prompt};
You can only accept one mission at a time, so you'll have to complete your current task properrrly before you try to move onto the next.${prompt};
Rise in rank enough, and maybe I'll come to you directly and ask you to do a mission forrr me one day!${prompt};
I have high hopes for you. I'm sure one day you'll be considerrred an indispensable agent of Windurst.${prompt};
Well, I'd better get going soon.;
Wait a moment...! Look what the cat just drrragged in...${prompt};
Forrrgive me, but I have to run. I'm surrre we will cross paths again, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You are in Port Windurst, Windurst's gateway to the air.${prompt};
Forrr instance, if you cross this open space and follow the path to the east farrr enough, you'll find the air travel agency where the airships operate out of.${prompt};
In order to ride an airship though, you'll need to have gained quite an amount of fame or forrrtune. But...${prompt};
...I'm sure you'll work hard enough to ride on an airrrship one day. You'll then be able to fly to a country called Jeuno.${prompt};
There are also a lot of shops in this port area. There's the Fishermen's Guild, a magic shop, an armorer and a weapons trader on the wharrrves here.${prompt};
They might not have an impressive assorrrtment, but I'm sure it is enough for the beginner.${prompt};
Then finally, there is the most imporrrtant building in the port area, the Orastery and its Mage Academy, that you can see behind me.${prompt};
The Orastery is one of Windurst's five ministries of magic, most famous forrr its War Warlocks, an army composed of talented mages and magic users.${prompt};
Only the most elite Tarutaru are affiliated with the War Warlocks, so some are a rrreal handful to keep in line at ti...${prompt};
Grr...!;
Speaking of “witch”...${prompt};
Sorry to cut my explanation short, but I have to go.${prompt};
Well, do your utmost for the sake of the peace of Windurst and the Star Sibyl. If you do, I'm surrre we'll cross paths again.${prompt};
Extra! Extra! Hear all about it!♪;
“Magic Paradise Weekly” is chock-a-block full of the latest news in Windu～rst!♪ Our chief editor, Naiko-Paneiko, is...${prompt};
Huh!? What's up?;
Yeah, I said Naiko-Paneiko... What's it to you? He wants us to hand in our news articles? Oh, zooks! It's our deadline already?${prompt};
Darn. I needed more time to come up with a better story so I could win the Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for unexpected journalistic ability. Anyway, here... Take it, you scoundrel.${prompt};
I needed more time to come up with a better story so I could win the Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for unexpected journalistic ability. Anyway, take it to him, you scoundrel.${prompt};
Huh? Burrrnite shell?;
I've neverrr hearrrd of such a shell, neitherrr in the sea orrr on the land!${prompt};
Gah-hahahah!;
You be after burnite shell, eh, me matey? Well, aren't you a fool-hearty one to be chasing a thing like that?${prompt};
Ye see, matey, them burnite shells have long been extinct. They haven't been around since, well, before fair Windurst was even settled!${prompt};
Burnite shells...?;
Where have I heard that name before?${prompt};
That's it!;
If I remember correctly, Doctor Yoran-Oran in Windurst Walls had one once...${prompt};
Huh?;
Oh, you mean the kiddy-widdy who got into trouble here the other day?${prompt};
Yeah, I remember. He was one of the students in the advanced class we had visit here.${prompt};
I scolded him for using one of the Mage Academy's wands without permission.${prompt};
But it was our ministry's supervisors who were really-weally to blame for not locking the cupboards properly while we had children visiting.${prompt};
We have a lot of wands for the senior students here, and most of them are quite dangerous.${prompt};
Which wand was it that they messed around with...? Let me see... I think it was a Wand of Sleep.${prompt};
A Wand of Sleep, as the name suggests, is enhanced with a Sleep spell that puts the person on its receiving end into a deep slumber-wumber.${prompt};
What's that you say? The kiddy-widdy has had a Sleep spell cast on him?${prompt};
Well, to awaken someone from a Sleep spell you just have to hit them really hard, but I guess you can't go around bashing up children, can you?${prompt};
Then, why don'taru try and make him drink ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? That ought to wake the kiddy-widdy up.${prompt};
To awaken someone from a Sleep spell you just have to hit them really hard, but you can't go around bashing up children, so...${prompt};
How about making him drink ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? That ought to do the tricky-wicky.${prompt};
You tried using ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} on him and he still didn't wakey-wakey up, huh?${prompt};
I wonder what it could be...;
The only advice I can offer is that you speak to Pechiru-Mashiru--the kid's white magic teacher.${prompt};
Did you solve our little sleepy-head's problem?;
Phew...;
Now we can all sleep easier!${prompt};
The doors are firmly sealed shut.${prompt};
Ahoy! Ahoy!${prompt};
I was able to make some pretty cool stinky-bombs with the ${item-plural: 1[2]} you brought us!${prompt};
Star Onion Brigade, attentio～n! “Operation Onion” will now begin!${prompt};
The trap is set, and we're all in position! Now all we have to do is wait for the Cat Burglar to show!${prompt};
Oi! Whoever's in charge of candy provisions! How about you deal out some candy now?${prompt};
Oopsy-daisy!${prompt};
You idiot!;
You're pushing for a dishonorable discharge from the Star Onion Brigade for forgetting your candy responsibilities!${prompt};
Shhh...!;
Everyone quiet!;
She's coming!${prompt};
Wait till you see the whites of her eyes, then let her have it with our onion stinky-bombs!!!${prompt};
Three!${wait-animation: 2};
Two!${wait-animation: 2};
One!${wait-animation: 2};
Bombs away!;
Everybody, CHAAAAARRRGE!${prompt};
Yippee!;
Hi-ho Silver!;
Up and at 'em!;
Herrre we go again!;
Meow!;
(I think we knocked her out...!)${prompt};
(Good. Now let's quietly approach her and tie her up with our ropey-rope!)${prompt};
Ooo～h!${prompt};
<cough> <cough> Grrr...;
Pe-ew! Wh-what hit me?${prompt};
Not you S.O.B.'s again! What in blazes did you do that for?${prompt};
Boy, am I going to get you!!!;
Grrrowl!!!;
Waaa～rgh!${prompt};
Run for your li～ves!;
Oh, the Cat Burglar got away...${prompt};
...but she dropped a pretty little ball.${prompt};
I wonder if everyone will get angry with me if I take it?${prompt};
Ahoy! Ahoy!${prompt};
Good! Now that we're all here, it's time for the final showdown with that Cat Burglar!${prompt};
Star Onion Brigade, are you ready already? Then CHAAAA～RRGE!${prompt};
Ta-da～!;
The Star Onion Brigade is on the scene!${wait-animation: 3};
Nanaa Mihgo! Otherwise known as the Cat Burglar! We're on your tail now!${prompt};
We're not letting you out of here until you promise to give up your evil ways for good!${prompt};
Not you brrrats again! Don't you have betterrr things to do all day than to rrrub my furrr the wrrrong way?${prompt};
Bite your tongue! We're very busy-wusy fighting crime, you know?${prompt};
We're the ones who solve all of Windurst's problems that grown-ups turn a blind eye to!${prompt};
Oh, you'd betterrr be carrreful then. Sounds like you'rrre making me out to be some kind of baddy, or something?${prompt};
If you're out to stop baddies, then you should be chasing after the Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido, not me! He's the one to watch, you know?${prompt};
Huh?;
Is that true?${prompt};
Don't ask me! I don't know...I don't pay much attention to wumors.${prompt};
Then allow me to fill you in. The ministerrr of the Orastery is trying to revive “summoning magic”--the verrry magic that the Star Sibyl has forrrbidden.${prompt};
That evil little magician is abusing his authorrrity as ministerrr and acting out of line. But because he's a ministerrr, the Tarutaru grrrown-ups let him do as he pleases.${prompt};
Is this the kind of thing the Starrr Onion Brrrigade can allow to happen?${prompt};
......${prompt};
Perrrhaps you had betterrr learn morrre about the ways of grrrown-ups beforrre you go too farrr. The adult worrrld isn't as simple as your children's worrrld is...${prompt};
See you arrround, I suppose!${prompt};
Did the door just lock...?${prompt};
We've been had!${prompt};
Grrr...;
We've been shut in!${prompt};
A-ha-ha!;
If you don't hurrrry up and learn the ways of grrrown-ups, you'll meet worrrse fates than this! I hope this has prrroven to be a valuable lesson!${prompt};
Goodbye, my little kittens! This house is enchanted, so no matterrr how much noise you make, no one will everrr hearrr you!${prompt};
I hope the ghost of the summonerrr doesn't eat you! Farrrewell!${prompt};
Did she say “g-ghost”!?${prompt};
......${wait-animation: 3};
Zoinks...!${prompt};
E-e-e-every-one re-m-m-main c-c-calm!${prompt};
Th-there's no-no-no s-s-such th-things as g-ghosties! The C-cat Burglar is j-just trying t-to s-scare us!${prompt};
Th-there's got to be a perfectly reasonable explanation for this! L-let's check out where the s-sound came from...e-everyone!${prompt};
Looky-see...;
There's a gap behind this bookshelf!${prompt};
The sound we heard was just the wind blowing in from there...${prompt};
Phew...${prompt};
Don't scarrre us like that!${prompt};
So da ghosty's twue identity was just da wind!${prompt};
It's pwetty dark and hard to tell, but if dere are a lot of gaps in da walls, den dey might give us a clue to get out of here!${prompt};
Arrrrrgggghhhyaaaa!!!;
Dere's a c-c-corpse!${prompt};
A corpse!${prompt};
A corpse!?${prompt};
You mean ath in...a dead body!?${prompt};
No, Pichichi!;
Keep back!;
It's too dangerous!${prompt};
But a dead body ith not dangerouth, ith it?${prompt};
I, erh, guess not...but a ghosty may come out of it!${prompt};
But a ghothty ith an undead body, not a dead body, right?${prompt};
Um...;
Either way, I don't think it's wise to find out!${prompt};
Ah...!;
Huh...?${prompt};
Wo-wo-wo-wo-whoah!${prompt};
Wee!;
He came back to life again!${prompt};
......?${prompt};
Good morning, thleepy head!;
My name ith Pichichi!${prompt};
And you are...?${prompt};

A ghothty!${prompt};
......${prompt};
jOkEr★Is nOt A ghOst!${prompt};
JoKeR iS a★CaRdIaN!${prompt};
Ye～ah! I'm glad to be out of there!${wait-animation: 1};
Yet another close call for the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
I thought we were goners when we were twapped in dere with dat ghosty!${prompt};
But it was no ghosty-whosty, it was a Cardiany!${prompt};
So ghosties don't rrreally exist! Now that's a rrrelief!${prompt};
But it was still frightening enough! I swearrr my tail has shrrrunk an ilm!${prompt};
And thanks to Joker, we were able to escape!${prompt};
Well, that was more than enough adventure for today... Let's all head back to Star Onion headquarters at the port.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Ith that your home there, Mither Ghothty?${prompt};

Then why don't you come home with uth?${prompt};
JoKeR......;
............!${prompt};On dirait qu'on voit beaucoup Semih Lafihna, la Garde Sibylle qui protège la grande Étoile Sibylle à la Tour du Ciel, dans le coin ces derniers temps.${prompt}
jOkEr★iS nOt A gHoSt!;Je me demande s'il y a eu un incident qu'elle vérifie ici ? Je parie que c'est encore ce Voleur de Chats qui fait des siennes !${prompt}
JoKEr Is a★CaRdIan!;Comment ça se fait que les Humains et les Elvaans changent autant d'apparence en vieillissant ?${prompt}
Come on!;Je parie qu'ils ne s'ennuient jamais de changer autant tous les jours. Peut-être qu'ils aiment même vieillir ?${prompt}
Hurry up!${prompt};Voilà la célèbre Académie de Magie, bastion de la méchanceté !${prompt}
......!${prompt};En vérité, c'est le ministre de ce ministère qui est vraiment le plus notoirement méchant là-bas !${prompt}
We seem to be seeing a lot of Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard who protects the great Star Sibyl at Heavens Tower, in these parts lately-wately.${prompt};Oh là là ! Tu les vois d'ici ? Ces utilisateurs de magie de haut niveau s'entraînent à lancer leurs sorts là-bas !${prompt}
I wonder if there was some kind of incident that she's checking out here? I bet it's that Cat Burglar getting up to her usual tricks again!${prompt};L'Orastère gère cette Académie de Magie, qui est chargée de former et de diriger les armées de professionnels de la magie. Oh, ce que je donnerais pour pouvoir les rejoindre !${prompt}
How come Humeys and Elvaanys changey so much in appearance as they get oldery?${prompt};Continue vers l'est par ici, et tu seras sur la route vers les Bois de Windurst, le quartier où habitent la plupart des Mithras de cette ville.${prompt}
I bet they never get boredy-woredy changing so muchy everyday. Maybe they even enjoy growing oldery?${prompt};Les Mithras viennent à l'origine d'une autre terre, loin de l'autre côté des mers. On dit que les Mithras sont arrivées à Windurst pour nous prêter main forte quand nous étions en guerre avec les hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
That there is the notorious Mage Academy, bastion of badness!${prompt};Chut !
Well, in truth, it's the minister of this ministry who's really the notoriously bad one there!${prompt};Silence ou ma fille va me remarquer. Je la suis pour m'assurer qu'elle ne se mette pas dans le pétrin...${prompt}
Wowy-wow-wow! You see them from here? Those high-level magic users are practaruicing their spells over there!${prompt};Ah～w... Tu vois, elle se trompe complètement. La magie de haut niveau ne s'achète pas ici. Elle était censée aller aux Eaux de Windurst pour ça ! Qu'ai-je fait pour mériter un enfant pareil ?${prompt}
The Orastery operates that Mage Academy, which is in charge of training and running the armies of pro magic users. Oh, what I'd give to be able to join them!${prompt};Shopping pour maman!♪
Keep heading east through here, and you'll be on the road to Windurst Woods, home to most of the Mithra in this town.${prompt};Shopping pour ma～man!♪${prompt}
The Mithra are originally from another land, far across the seas. They say the Mithra originally arrived in Windurst to lend us a hand back when we were at war with the beastmen.${prompt};Maman m'a envoyé faire des courses plus difficiles que d'habitude aujourd'hui, mais Paruru ne s'en soucie pas. Paruru peut gérer ça !
Shhh!;Tu vois, j'ai réussi à venir jusqu'à cette boutique de magie toute seule ! Maman va être tellement contente !${prompt}
Be quiet or my daughter will notice me. I'm shadowing her to see that she doesn't get into any trouble-wouble...${prompt};La vente de magie de haut niveau aux aventuriers a été restreinte depuis la dernière cérémonie de la Lecture des Étoiles, mais ils ont décidé de lever l'interdiction.${prompt}
Ah～w... See, she's got it all wrong. High level magic can't be bought here. She was supposed to go to Windurst Waters for that! What did I do to deserve a child-wild like this?${prompt};Il semble qu'Ajido-Marujido, le ministre de l'Orastérie, ait fait pression sur les autres ministres pour obtenir gain de cause.${prompt}
Shopping for mommy!♪;Quels types de terres existent dans le vaste monde qui se trouve de l'autre côté de ces océans ? Je rêve d'être comme ces aventuriers qui voyagent à travers la mer vers des terres inconnues.${prompt}
Shopping for mo～mmy!♪${prompt};Je sais qu'il y a des dangers inimaginables qui les attendent là-bas, mais on dit que l'esprit d'une fille adore le danger.${prompt}
Mommy sent me on a harder shopping errand than usual today, but Paruru doesn't mind. Paruru can handle this!;Je suis heureuse que les bêtes ne sachent pas comment piloter des navires. Vous voyez, Windurst est pratiquement sans défense contre les attaques venant de la mer.${prompt}
See, I made it all the way to this magic shop on my own! Mommy is going to be sooo pleasedy-weasedy!${prompt};Ce serait différent si les Cardians savaient nager, mais ces automates ont déjà du mal à rester à flot !${prompt}
The sale of high-level magic to adventurers has been restricted since the last Star Reading ceremony, but they've just gone and decided to lift the ban.${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui fait voler ces aéronefs ? Ne tombent-ils pas parfois du ciel ?${prompt}
Seems that Ajido-Marujido, the Minister of the Orastery, heavied the other ministers to getaru his way.${prompt};Quel type de magie les maintient en l'air ? Et qui les a inventés et quand ? Oh, vous êtes juste comme les autres, hein ? Pourquoi personne ne peut-il répondre à mes questions alors !?${prompt}
What kind of lands are there in the vast world that lies on the other side of these oceans? I dream of being like those adventurers who travel-wravel across the sea to unknown lands.${prompt};N'as-tu jamais entendu...?
I know that there are unimaginable danger-wangers that await them there, but they say a girl's mind adores danger.${prompt};Quelque part de l'autre côté de la mer, il y a une ancienne ville portuaire.${prompt}
I'm glad beastmen don't know how to steer-a-weer ships. You see, Windurst is practically defenseless against attack-a-wacks from the sea.${prompt};Toutes sortes de plantes étranges et merveilleuses poussent autour de cette ville portuaire. Il semble que le laboratoire biologique du Rhinostery ait conclu un accord pour obtenir ces plantes via la ville portuaire voisine de Mhaura.${prompt}
It'd be a different matter if Cardians could swim-a-wim, but those automatons have a hard enough time trying to keep afloat-a-woat!${prompt};Cette route mène aux Bois de Windurst, tu sais ? Mais je ferais mieux de te prévenir, cet endroit est infesté de Mithras !${prompt}
What is it that makes them airships fly? Don't they sometimes drop from the sky?${prompt};Ce n'est pas qu'ils le font exprès... oups, je veux dire volontairement... mais ces Mithras ne regardent tout simplement pas où ils marchent ! Donc, nous, les Tarutarus, devons faire attention à ne pas nous faire piétiner jusqu'à la mort !${prompt}
What kind of magic keeps them up? And who was it that invented them and when? Oh, you're just like the others, yup? Why can't anyone answer my questions then!?${prompt};Ne sais-tu pas ?
Haven'taru ever heard...?;N'importe qui ne peut pas sauter à bord et descendre de ces aéronefs comme un rarab enragé.${prompt}
Somewhere on the other side of the sea there is an ancient harbor town.${prompt};Tu dois d'abord acheter un laissez-passer, mais ça coûte une jolie somme, tu sais ! Je déteste juger les gens sur leur apparence, mais, garçon, à en juger par ton look, tu n'as aucune chance de voler dans les cieux amicaux sur un aéronef !${prompt}
All kinds of strange and wonderful plant life grow around that harbor town. It seems the Rhinostery's biological laboratory has struck a deal to obtain these plants via the nearby port town of Mhaura.${prompt};Tu dois d'abord acheter un laissez-passer, mais ça coûte une jolie somme, tu sais !
This road leads to Windurst Woods, y'know? But I better warn ya, that place is crawling with Mithra!${prompt};Hein ? Tu en as un ? Garçon, je t'ai sous-estimé !${prompt}
Not that they do it on paw-puss...oops, I means purpose...but them Mithra just don't look where they're treading-wedding! So, us Tarutaru have gotta look out that we's don't get trampled-wampled to deaths!${prompt};Extra ! Extra ! Écoutez tous les derniers potins !♪
Don'taru you know?;“Magic Paradise Weekly” est rempli des dernières nouvelles de Windurst !♪ Obtenez votre exemplaire au bureau du Tarutaru Times dans les Eaux de Windurst dès aujourd'hui !♪${prompt}
Not just anyone can go hopping on and off those airships like a rabid rarab.${prompt};Notre prochaine édition spéciale est...(Qu'est-ce que c'était encore ?) Eh bien, tu devras acheter le prochain numéro de “Magic Paradise Weekly” pour le découvrir !
You first need to buy a pass, but they cost a pretty penny, they do! I hate to judge people by their appearances, but boy, by the looks of things, you ain't got a hope of flying the friendly skies on no airship!${prompt};Extra ! Extra ! Écoutez tous les derniers potins !♪${prompt}
You first need to buy a pass, but they cost a pretty penny, they do!;La mer cultive une infinité de cadeaux qu'elle offre aux habitants de la terre. Mais qu'offrent en retour les habitants de la terre à la mer ?${prompt}
Huh? You've got one? Boy, did I underestimate you!${prompt};Je suis venu des campagnes dans l'espoir de devenir un Garde Sibyl pour protéger la Grande Prêtresse, mais ils m'ont renvoyé, disant que je n'avais pas ce qu'il fallait...${prompt}
Extra! Extra! Hear all about it!♪;Ahhh... Mais il est vrai que mes compétences à l'arc semblent enfantines comparées à celles de ces femmes. Je suppose que je dois apprendre à chasser depuis le début sous la direction de la chef de ma tribu.${prompt}
“Magic Paradise Weekly” is chock-a-block full of the latest news in Windu～rst!♪ Get your copy at the Tarutaru Times office in Windurst Waters today!♪${prompt};"Comment acquérir les compétences nécessaires pour devenir un maître-chasseur, ou ""ranger"". Cela me rappelle que je dois rencontrer Perih Vashai... Elle devrait être dans la partie Mithra de la ville...${prompt}"
Our next special feature is...(What the heck was it again?)...well, you'll just have to buy the next issue of “Magic Paradise Weekly” to find out!;J'ai été invitée à rejoindre la réunion secrète derrière les entrepôts, mais je ne les trouve pas. Que faire ?${prompt}
Extra! Extra! Hear all about it!♪${prompt};De l'autre côté de cet océan se trouve une petite ville portuaire qui est notre terre natale à nous, les Mithra. Ma mère et ma sœur y vivent encore.${prompt}
The sea cultivates an unlimited assorrrtment of gifts that it gives to the land dwellerrrs. But what do the land dwellerrrs give the sea back in returrrn?${prompt};Mais j'ai choisi d'obéir à la voix de la nature et de partir à l'aventure en tant que guerrière. Même si ma terre natale me manque, je sais que je n'y remettrai probablement jamais les pieds...${prompt}
I came all the way frrrom the countrrryside in the hopes of becoming a Sibyl Guarrrd to guarrrd the Starrr Sibyl, but they sent me packing, saying I didn't have what it takes...${prompt};Les Bois de Windurst, la partie de la ville majoritairement habitée par les Mithra, se trouvent au-delà d'ici. Si vous êtes intéressé par les métiers d'art, vous serez heureux de savoir que la Guilde des Osselets et la Guilde des Tisserands s'y trouvent.${prompt}
Ahhh... But it is trrrue that my bow skills seem like child's play when comparrred to the likes of those women. I guess I must go and learrrn to hunt from scrrratch underrr the guidance of my trrribal chieftainness.${prompt};Rien de tel que la maison, hein ? Eh bien, il y a des Mithra qui disent que ce n'est pas et ne sera jamais leur maison...${prompt}
How to gain the skills requirrred to become a master-hunterrr, or “ranger”. That rrreminds me. I have to go meet Perih Vashai... She should be in the Mithra parrrt of town...${prompt};Mais pour les Mithra comme moi, qui sont nés après la guerre, Windurst est la seule maison que nous connaissons.${prompt}
I was invited to join the secrrret meeting behind the warrrehouses, but I can't find them. What's a girrrl to do?${prompt};Donc c'est l'un des monstres-poupées en bois créés par les Tarutaru, hein ?${prompt}
On the otherrr side of this ocean therrre is a small harborrr town that is the homeland of us Mithra. My motherrr and sisterrr still live therrre.${prompt};Pourquoi, il a l'air beaucoup plus mignon que je ne le pensais. Voyons s'il mangera ces noix. Allez, mange ! Allez, mange, petit !${prompt}
But I chose to obey the voice of naturrre and jourrrney out into the unknown as a warriorrr. Even though I pine for my homeland, I know I probably will neverrr set foot on its ground everrr again...${prompt};On dit que les mages rouges utilisent la magie pour enchanter leurs épées ! Pourraient-ils vraiment être si irresponsables ? Ils tueraient la noble lame !${prompt}
Windurst Woods, the predominately Mithra parrrt of town, lies beyond herrre. If you arrre interrrested in handicrafts then you will be pleased to know that the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild are located therrre.${prompt};La voie de l'épée est de couper tout ce qui n'est pas l'épée ! Les sentiments superflus, les pensées vagabondes, et les artifices de la magie n'ont pas leur place. Même les rayons du soleil ne devraient pas être autorisés à errer le long de son acier, vraiment.${prompt}
There's no place like home, heh? Well, there arrre some Mithra who say this is not and will neverrr be theirrr home...${prompt};Les aéronefs ont été inventés par Jeuno, vous savez ? L'Archiduc de Jeuno croit que nous nous dirigeons vers une ère des cieux, alors il a rassemblé des génies pour créer ces navires volants.${prompt}
But for Mithra like myself, who were borrrn after the warrr, Windurst is the only home we know.${prompt};Mais savoir cela ne diminue en rien l'émerveillement que ces choses suscitent...${prompt}
So this is one of the wooden puppet-monsters the Tarutaru created, eh?${prompt};Il y a des vols réguliers de Jeuno vers Windurst, San d'Oria, et Bastok, donc nous finirons par retourner sur l'aéronef entre Windurst et Jeuno.${prompt}
Why, it looks a lot cuter than I had expected. Let's see if it will eat these nuts. Here boy, eat! C'mon eat it, boy!${prompt};J'espère que notre prochain poste sera à San d'Oria... une fois que j'aurai acheté tous les souvenirs que je veux de Windurst, bien sûr.${prompt}
'Tis said that red mages use magic to enchant their swords! Could they truly be so irresponsible? They would kill the noble blade!${prompt};Il semble que nous, les Galka, soyons rares dans ces parages.${prompt}
The way of the sword is to cut away all that is not the sword! Superfluous feelings, wandering thoughts, and the trappings of magic have no place. Not even the sun's rays should be allowed to roam along its steel, really.${prompt};Il y a un flux constant de Tarutaru, chacun prenant son tour pour nous observer. Bien que cela ne me fasse pas me sentir indésirable, cela ne me met pas non plus à l'aise.${prompt}
The airships were invented by Jeuno, you know? The Archduke of Jeuno believes we are heading into an age of the skies, so he gathered masterminds together to create those flying ships.${prompt};S'ils sont si intéressés par nous, pourquoi ne viennent-ils pas nous voir de plus près, au lieu de jeter des coups d'œil depuis les ombres ?${prompt}
But knowing that by no means lessens how amazing those things are...${prompt};Je veux leur dire en face, mais ces Tarutaru s'enfuient avant que je puisse les approcher.${prompt}
There are regular flights from Jeuno to Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok, so we'll eventually be returning on the airship between Windurst and Jeuno.${prompt};
I'm hoping our next post is in San d'Oria...once I've bought all the souvenirs I want from Windurst, that is.${prompt};Oh déesse, est-ce que je me sens mal !?${prompt}
It seems we Galka are a rare sight in these parts.${prompt};Je, je vais mourir, n'est-ce pas...?
There's been a steady flow of Tarutaru each taking their turn to stand and stare at us. While it doesn't make me feel unwelcome, it doesn't exactly make me feel comfortable either.${prompt};Beurk, si ça peut apaiser ce sentiment, alors peut-être que c'est pour le mieux. Dites simplement désolé à tous mes fans à la maison...${prompt}
If they're that interested in us, then why don't they come right up to us and have a closer look, rather than peeking out from the shadows?${prompt};Laisserai-je quelque chose derrière moi pour qu'ils se souviennent de moi...? BAAARRRRFFFFF!!!${prompt}
I want to tell them that straight to their faces, but those Tarutaru run away before I can approach them.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que Windurst est une terre de magiciens, mais on dirait que tout le monde ici ne sait pas vraiment utiliser la magie.${prompt}
Erk...!;Cela montre bien... il y a beaucoup de choses que l'on ne sait pas sur ce monde tant qu'on ne les voit pas de ses propres yeux !${prompt}
Oh my Goddess, do I feel sick!?${prompt};Ne me dites pas qu'il pense à une sorte de bêtise encore une fois ? Oh, Maître Sigismund...!${prompt}
I, I'm going to die, aren't I...?;Nous serons encore en retard pour notre dirigeable. J'ai perdu le compte du nombre de vols que nous avons manqués !${prompt}
Eww, if that'll ease this feeling, then maybe it's for the better. Just say sorry to all my fans back home...${prompt};Vous aussi, voyageur, êtes-vous venu à Windurst pour admirer le Grand Arbre Étoilé ? Si c'est le cas, l'arbre étoilé, également connu sous le nom de Tour des Cieux, se trouve loin au nord-est d'ici, dans les Murailles de Windurst.${prompt}
Will I leave anything behind for them to remember me by...? BAAARRRRFFFFF!!!${prompt};Si vous voulez, je peux utiliser ma magie pour vous envoyer aux Murailles de Windurst en un instant. Voudriez-vous cela ?${prompt}
I heard Windurst is a land of magic users, but it doesn't look like everyone around here can actually use magic.${prompt};Voulez-vous être téléporté aux Murailles de Windurst ?
Just goes to show...there's a lot of things you don't know about this world until you actually go see for yourself!${prompt};
Don't tell me he's thinking of some sort of mischief again? Oh, Master Sigismund...!${prompt};
We'll be late for our airship again. I've lost count of the number of flights we've missed!${prompt};
Have you, traveler, also come to Windurst to take a looky at the Great Star Tree? If so, then the star tree, also known as Heavens Tower, is far to the northeasty of here, in Windurst Walls.${prompt};Approchez, approchez ! C'est votre dernière chance de faire du shopping à Windurst ! Achetez vos souvenirs ou terminez vos achats oubliés ici !${prompt}
If you wanty, I can use my magic to sendy you to Windurst Walls in an instant. Would you likey that?${prompt};Hmm... Je me demande ce que les étrangers aiment acheter ?${prompt}
Warpy to Windurst Walls?;Bienvenue !

Hey, you! Yes, you, the grown-up there! What are you staring at? You wanna join our Star Onion Brigade, don'taru?${prompt};
Join the ranks of the S.O.B.?;
${selection-lines};
I was born to be an S.O.B.!;
You've got to be kidding!${prompt};
What, are you afraid of us or something? Well, that's because we, the Star Onion Brigade, are invincible!${prompt};
Da Star Onion Bwigade are invincible!;
Are invincible-wincible!;
Are invinthible!;
Arrre invincible!!!;
Yeah, we'rrre prrretty invincy-bull!;
Ah! Oh, oh, rea～lly?;

Time to powwow! Powwow! Let's have a secret-wecret meeting!${prompt};

You idiot!;
That's the leader's line...!${prompt};
Everybody gather together!;
C'mon, let's huddle!${prompt};
(So...erm...what do we do?)${prompt};
(We can't let a gwown-up join dis gwoup!)${prompt};
(Dis gwoup was formed to oppose selfish gwown-ups.)${prompt};
(Huh? What's shellfish got to do with this?)${prompt};
(But, hey, grrrown-ups have lots of money. If we let grrrown-ups join our grrroup, they could buy us lots of trrreats!)${prompt};
(Don't think of trrreats! Motherrr always says, “Honorrr before gain!”)${prompt};
(Huh? Who's “on a beef again”?)${prompt};
Argh...!;
We're never going to decide!${prompt};
Hey, Pichichi...;
You haven't said anything yet.;
What do you think, Pichichi?${prompt};
Don't athk me!;
I haven't got a clue!${prompt};
But my mommy thaid she wanted a tail!${prompt};
A tail...?${prompt};
Well, grown-up...you heard the girl!${prompt};
For the sake of Pichichi! For the sake of Windurst's peace, love, and righteousness!${prompt};
It's decided then. If you bring us a tail, we'll let you join the Star Onion Briga～de!${prompt};
If you bring us a tail, we'll let you join the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
As leader, I won't break my promise! A member of the Star Onion Brigade never lies!${prompt};
Pichichi's mother wuns the hostelwy in Windurst Waters, wight?${prompt};
Maybe dat's a clue as to what kind of tail she wants?${prompt};
You, you, you keep away from me, you hear! Tarutaru don't have no taily-wailys!${prompt};
I know what you're thinking-winking! You're out to stealy-wealy someone's tail!${prompt};
Don't athk me!;
I haven't got a clue!${prompt};
Jutht that my mommy thaid she wanted a tail! That'th all!${prompt};
I wonderrr what Pichichi's motherrr wants a tail forrr?${prompt};
Purrrhaps she wished she had been born a Mithra? I feel sorry forrr herrr having been borrrn a Tarutaru instead!${prompt};
I don't underrrstand what just went on herrre, but it might just mean you can join our brrrigade!${prompt};
If you do join, then rememberrr to keep honorrr beforrre gain! And while you'rrre at it, I'd like to eat some frrresh fish, if you have any sparrre that is...${prompt};
What happened?;
What went on just now?${prompt};
I bet they decided something important without including me again, right? Ohww, I'm always left out!${prompt};
Uh-oh...!;
A rarab's tail!?${prompt};
Listen, I know we said to get a tail, but a poor, little, innocent rarab...?${prompt};
Oh, look!;
It'th a tail like mommy wanted!${prompt};
What the...?${prompt};
Hey, Pichichi!;
Is this the tail you wanted for your mother? Is this what she was looking for?${prompt};
Yeth, of courthe!;
Mommy's hotel ith called “The Rarab Tail Hothtelry”!${prompt};
You thee?;
Mommy always wants lots of ${item-plural: 1[2]}! She uthes them to make pickles for the cuthtomers.${prompt};
You don't say...?;
Well then, I guess that decides it, then! You, grown-up, have passed the test, and can join our brigade!${prompt};
Here...;
This ${item-singular: 2[2]} is the symbol of the Star Onion Brigade! Don't go losing it!${prompt};
Now that you're a member of the Star Onion Brigade, you have to remember our oath!${prompt};
Once you've learned the oath, then you've got to put it into practice. Don't expect us to go easy on you just 'cause you're old!${prompt};
I told dem dat we don't need no adults in our bwigade, but dey wouldn't listen to me!${prompt};
Dis Star Onion Bwigade was formed to cowwect da wrong-doings of adults and was supposed to be a secwet club!${prompt};
I don't understand the ins-and-outs of this brigade, but it seems the tail tale got you in.${prompt};
Anyway, welcome aboard!${prompt};
So you've become a memberrr of the Starrr Onion Brigade, huh?${prompt};
But is it all rrright for an adult like you to be in alliance with childrrren? Won't that put you in bad standing with otherrr grrrown-ups?${prompt};
The Starrr Onion Brrrigade badges arrre made with the harrrd efforrrts of all us herrre.${prompt};
Yourrrs is a little bent out of shape, but it's still kinda cool-looking, isn't it?${prompt};
How come you got a badge before I did? That's so unfair it's unforgivable! Ohww, I'm always left out!${prompt};
Wee! Thank you for the lovely tail! Mommy told me I thould collect a whole bathketful of these...${prompt};
Oh, and my name ith Pichichi. I hope we can be good friendth.♪${prompt};
Hey, newbie!${prompt};
Too bad, but you missed out big! While you were away, we went to the ghosty house!${prompt};
We nearly nabbed that Cat Burglar until she escaped! But we made off with her Mana Orb! A pretty awesome adventure, don'taru think?${prompt};
Oh, so you wanna know more, do you? Well, I guess we could tell you... Listen and listen good...${prompt};
...Well that's kina what happened.;
Cool, huh?${prompt};
You should have been there to help us at the ghosty house, too! Be more careful next time!;
Well, see you next adventure we have!${prompt};
Hey, newbie!${prompt};
You're late! What took you?;
If you had brought us what we asked for quicker, you wouldn't have missed all the action!${prompt};
If you bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}, we'll tell you all about it!${prompt};
Hey, newbie!${prompt};
You missed some pretty cool action while you were away.${prompt};
We'll tell you all about it...but, only if you bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Oi, newbie!;
If you hurry up and bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}, we'll tell you all about our showdown with the Cat Burglar!${prompt};
Attaboy!;
These are just what I wanted!${prompt};
We can make some stinky bombs with these! Kinda like the ones we made the other day when...${prompt};
...And that's how we made off with the Cat Burglar's Mana Orb.;
Pretty awesome, huh?${prompt};
If you want to join in our major projects like this one, you'll have to participate in our meetings! Anyway, until then, see you around, I s'pose!${prompt};
I've received some new information...information regarding the activities of none other than the Cat Burglar herself!${prompt};
She has been seen loitering in the vicinity of the haunted mansion in Windurst Walls, otherwise known to us as the “ghosty house”!${prompt};
This piece of intelligence was provided to us by the Star Onion Brigade's Windurst Walls Recon Team, Juna Moshal and Chomomo. A round of applause for the two of them...${prompt};
Da ghosty house in Windurst Walls...? Wasn't dat owiginally supposed to be de doctor's wesidence for the minister of de Optistewy?${prompt};
Precisely...;
No one is supposed to live there, except <gasp!> occasionally you can see suspicious shadows moving inside there!${prompt};
But doesn't that house have some sort of impenetrrrable magic locks on its doorrrs?${prompt};
Correct! That's what makes it all the more intriguing! I have a feeling that the Cat Burglar's next target is that very building!${prompt};
Everyone, listen up! This time it's war! Once we have our weapons and provisions ready, we are to march straight to the ghosty house and lay a trap to bag the Cat Burglar once and for all!${prompt};
Grrreat leaderrr!;
What kind of trrrap shall we lay for herrr this time?${prompt};
Let me see...;
What kind of trap would be fitting in this situation... Ah! I've got it!${prompt};
Hey, newbie!;
You can be in charge of traps! We'll need four ${item-plural: 1[2]} so hurry up and get them!${prompt};
Once the newbie gets back with the ammo, we'll put our plan into action!${prompt};
Yippee!;
Hi-ho Silver!;
Up and at 'em!;
Herrre we go again!;
Meow!;
Having the right trap waiting for the Cat Burglar is really important. Hurry up and bring us four ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Then we can march to the ghosty house and set an ambush for her!${prompt};
Dis looks like a job for my twusty Super Onion Staff--a legendawy weapon dat has been handed down in my family since my gwandfather's day!${prompt};
Ha-haa! Just you wait, Cat Burglar! You'll be no match for me and my staff!${prompt};
My weapon of preference is the hammer-wammer!${prompt};
Only real men use hammers!${prompt};
I wonder if I athk Mommy nithely, she'll make me a weapon?${prompt};
The ultimate killing machine would be cool, but a pretty staff of tranthformation would altho be thweet...${prompt};
Grrrowl...;
I don't need no weapons!${prompt};
My claws and teeth arrre my weapons! Cat Burrrglar! Hearrr my roarrr!${prompt};
Well, I betterrr preparrre lots of tools too, if we're gonna catch the Cat Burglarrr!${prompt};
Firrrst I'll get a fishing net! Fishing nets rrreek of fish, so the Cat Burrrglar will be overrrcome by the smell and walk rrright into it!${prompt};
Well done!;
Now we can put our plan into action! Off to the ghosty house we go!${prompt};
But, before we set out...I had better make my special stink-bombs out of these ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
You know the way to the ghosty house, right? Then get your own weapons and equipment in order, and wait for us there!${prompt};
Hey newbie, what kept you? We ended up losing sight of the Cat Burglar.${prompt};
It's all Pichichi's fault. If only she hadn't have scrrreamed and woken herrr up!${prompt};
And just when we had the Cat Burglar-wurglar in our grasp, too...${prompt};
But, I wath thuprithed to find thith...${prompt};
Wow! What is it?${prompt};
Cool! It's a treasure-weasure!${prompt};
Let us have a closerrr look!${prompt};
I know what dat ball is! Dat's a Mana Orb! It's da heart of a Cardian!${prompt};
But Mana Orbs are closely contwolled by da people in charge of da Cardian workshop in da Manustewy! For it to be lying awound dere must mean dat da Cat Burglar had it in her possession...!${prompt};
I smell a rat...or in this case, a cat! She must have stolen it from somewhere! We're onto something big here!${prompt};
Next time that Cat Burglar sneaks into the ghosty house, we'll nab her for good!${prompt};
What?;
Don't we have to return the Mana Orb to the Manustery?${prompt};
No way! This is very important evidence we have here! Proof that the Cat Burglar committed a crime!${prompt};
<huff><puff>;
Ha... Hah...;
I'm exhausted!${prompt};
We oughta check into dat ghosty house a little more...${prompt};
But we don't know how much of what gwown-ups tell us is twue or just stowies. No one can twust adults in dis sad world of ours!${prompt};
When I saw the Cat Burglar's tail waving about all to-and-fro as she ran away, my eyes began to spinny-winny. That's why she was able to get away from me!${prompt};
We're not so good at magic-wagic yet, so I don't have a cluey-wuey how a ball like that could make a Cardian move.${prompt};
It's all Pichichi's fault. Who else could it be?;
Arrrgh!${prompt};
We might have the evidence, but it's useless while the Cat Burrrglar is still at larrrge!${prompt};
Anyway, we had betterrr stow the Mana Orrrb safely away somewherrre. Leave the guarrrding job to me!${prompt};
The Cat Burrrglar got away again! Eeew, I'm so frrrustrrrated!${prompt};
The Cat Burglarrr got away again! Eeew, I'm so frrrustrrrated!${prompt};
But I bet she's looking high and low forrr herrr prrrecious Mana Orrrb! Hee-hee-hee... Rrrevenge is so sweet!${prompt};
......${prompt};
I wonder if mithuth Cat Burglar ith angry? Did Pichichi do thomething bad?${prompt};
Did you really-weally have a showdown with the Cat Burglar?${prompt};
Why don't you guys let me join in all the fun? Ohww, I'm always left out!${prompt};
O～h, you're late, as usual!;
Quickly, to fill you in on what you missed, well...something terrible happened!${prompt};
The Cat Burglar came by a moment ago and tried to scare us into returning the Mana Orb to her.${prompt};
She said it was too dangerous for the likes of us, 'cause some evil Cardians are after it! But we weren't fooled by her!${prompt};
She tried hard to break us, but we stood our ground until she gave up and sulked away! We won again! Yippee!${prompt};
But then something funny happened. When we checked the box we kept the Mana Orb in, it was empty! So, we're all wondering where-oh-where has our little Mana Orb gone?${prompt};
Now I propose we go hunt down the criminal! So how about you then? Are you in on it, too?${prompt};
Help catch the criminal?;
${selection-lines};
Cooperate.;
Get real!${prompt};
Oh! That can only mean one thing...;
You did it!;
You're the criminal!${prompt};
A-ha-ha... Just kidding!;
But if you keep up the wet blanket act, we'll kick you out of our Star Onion Brigade! I'm warning you!${prompt};
Said like a true Star Onion! We superheroes never let baddies get away with their crimes!${prompt};
So, getting down to business...;
In order to catch the criminal we'll need the seven gadgets found in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!${prompt};
Everyone knows what to do, rightaru? Each bring one gadget and meet back here! Then we can form our own real crime-fighting investigation unit!${prompt};
In order to catch the criminal, we'll need the seven gadgets found in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!${prompt};
So, each of us is to go find one gadget and meet back here! Then we can form our own real crime-fighting investigation unit!${prompt};
Hey, ${name-player}.;
You're looking kind of lotht! Lithten! I'll give you thome help...${prompt};
If you athk my mommy nithely, she'll make you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} to help dithguise yourthelf with!${prompt};
In times like dese, you need a magnifying glass! Dat's elementawy, my dear Watson-wotson! Ahem...${prompt};
If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the evening, hammer in the morning, hammer everybo～da～y!♪ Who needs a lockpick when you have a hammer to bish-bash locks with?${prompt};
Hmm...but that's just as bad as a robber? Oh well, then again, who cares about the minor points...?${prompt};
We'll be needing a lamp if we arrre going into darrrk places!${prompt};
Not that my Mithra eyes arrre bad or anything... Just that it'll hopefully scarrre away them ghosties!${prompt};
In orderrr to talk with each otherrr when we split up and are farrr away, we'll need a string-telephone. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} would be betterrr, I know, but we don't have enough money to buy one!${prompt};
One of the seven gadgets found in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit? Umm... Well... Maybe I'll bring a shovel! I kinda dig them! Ohww, but I'm so left out, I don't know what to do!${prompt};
Great!;
Looks like we have all seven gadgets as found in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!${prompt};
But waitaru!;
Hey, Pichichi!;
You don't have your gadget yet!;
What's the mattaru?${prompt};
Umm...;
Well...;
Will thith do...?${prompt};
Argh!;
That's the Mana Orb!${prompt};
What in hell's bells are you doing with it, Pichichi?${prompt};
So da cwime was committed by one of us! Dis is an intwiguing turn of events!${prompt};
I didn't want you to give thith pretty ball away to anyone, tho, tho...${prompt};
Tho when I heard Kohlo-Lakolo wath going to give it away to thomebody, I dethided to thecretly hide it!${prompt};
So, it was Pichichi who took it and hid it away! Well, chalk up another one to the Star Onion Brigade, 'cause it looks like this mystery is also solved!${prompt};
Thith mythtery ith altho tholved!${prompt};
I was forgetting that this Mana Orb is a priceless treasure of our Star Onion Brigade.${prompt};
After all, it's the first spoils we ever took from that Cat Burglar!${prompt};
That pretty ball ithn't jutht your ordinary ball!${prompt};
I can't explain why it ith different, it jutht ith!${prompt};
I'm disappointed dat I didn't get to show off my mega-fly magnifying glass.${prompt};
Did you know that if I aim my magnifying glass at dwy leaves dey cwickle-cwackle until dey suddenly burst into flames!${prompt};
Erg...I so wanted to show off my hammer-hammering skills.${prompt};
I wanted to become famous for “Gomada-Vulmada's 300 Super-Swift Mega-Hits”!${prompt};
What was it you brrrought with you?${prompt};
I wonderrr whetherrr it will be morrre useful than my lamp for scarrring away ghosties? Brrr...${prompt};
Grrr... After I went to all that trrrouble of getting Motherrr to make me a strrring telephone.${prompt};
It's all Pichichi's fault. I don't know why I hang out with this bunch of fools!${prompt};
The culprit is always the one you least suspect. I know 'cause I've read almost every one of the Agatha Crystalie mystery series. So you can leave this case to me.${prompt};
What do you mean, they've already solved “The Case of the Missing Mana Orb”? But the great detective Shanruru didn't get to make her appearance!? Ohww, they always leave me out!${prompt};
It seems as if the Cat Burglar has been coming and going in and out of the ghosty house!${prompt};
We should be investigating what she's up to in there, but that haunted house has a magic lock placed on its doors!${prompt};
I hear if we had the minister's ring we could unlock the place, but we can't just run up to Doctor Koru-Moru and borrow it from him, can we...?${prompt};
Huh?;
What's that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} you have there...? Where have I seen that before?${prompt};
Ah! That's a little old but it looks like the minister's ring. Oh, and I've seen that insignia somewhere... That's the ghosty house's mark!${prompt};
Everybody listen up here!;
The time for us to catch the Cat Burglar has come! We can now open the doors to the ghosty house!${prompt};
Let's go to the ghosty house before the Cat Burglar gets away! C'mon, move it, move it!${prompt};
The ring that you found was probably the previous Minister of the Optistery's ring. So long as we have this, we can handle any magic that the Optistery can throw at us.${prompt};
Let's go to the ghosty house and nab that Cat Burglar once and for all! C'mon, move it, move it!${prompt};
Ah! That's a little old, but it looks like the minister's ring. Oh, and I've seen that insignia somewhere... That's the ghosty house's mark!${prompt};
So you've found the key at last! Too bad we won't be needing it anymore...${prompt};
You see, while you were away, we heard news that the Cat Burglar had entered into the ghosty house. So naturally, we all headed straight to the crime scene!${prompt};
Pretty cool, huh?;
If only you had come by earlier, you could have been part of the action. But, oh well, too bad!${prompt};
Anyway, that ring you have there is mega-awesome! You should give it to the Star Onion Brigade to mind. You know, one for all and all for none, that kinda thing...${prompt};
Hey, how come you didn't come with us to the ghosty house? What, were you too afraid, or something?${prompt};
Well we went!;
And we had a totally wild experience. You see...${prompt};
Hee-hee-hee! Pretty cool, huh?;
It's the Star Onion Brigade's greatest adventure yet!${prompt};
Oh, and what we told you just now has to be kept a secret from the grown-ups, okay?;
♪Cross you heart and hope to die, stick Cactuar needles in your eye?♪${prompt};
We don't need any stwategies 'cause we have da twaps and other devices dat we'd been pweparing especially for dis day.${prompt};
A-hah...;
I have a feeling dat we'll catch da Cat Burglar for sure today!${prompt};
It's the final showdown! Good will at last conquer evil-wevil!${prompt};
The Cat Burrrglar's in the bag...I guess you could say.${prompt};
We'll teach herrr not to give us Mithra a bad name!${prompt};
We won't let herrr get away this time!${prompt};
Pichichi hath a thtrange feeling...${prompt};
...like we're being called to from thomewhere.${prompt};
I know, I know...;
I'm going to be left out again.We'll I don't care anymore!${prompt};
You, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/miss], are going to be beaten by the wily Cat Burglar again, along with the rest of those losers!${prompt};
Pichichi brought Joker back here with her, so we made him a member of the Star Onion Brigade.${prompt};
But you better keep it a secret from the other grown-ups. Cardians are under the control of the Manustery. If they find out about him, they'll take him away from us!${prompt};
We've got dat Cardian, Joker, hiding away.${prompt};
If any gwown-ups find him, dey'll take him away to the Manustewy. We can't allow dat to happen...not until we solve Joker's mystewy.${prompt};
Cardians are so strangey-wangey.;
They don't eat anything at all!${prompt};
Not like us people who eat to live and live to eat!${prompt};
That Carrrdian is top secrrret!${prompt};
Perrhaps he was teased by grrrown-ups so much that he hid in that house and fell asleep... Well that's what I think!${prompt};
With all these strrrange new memberrrs who've joined lately...there goes our Brrrigade!${prompt};
But I suppose the morrre people we have the merrrierrr it is. Well, at least when we play tag...${prompt};
Why does everyone have to call Mithter Ghothtie “Joker” for?${prompt};
I liked the name Mithter Ghothtie better!${prompt};
<sniff> <sniff>;
I'm glad you all made it back safely!${prompt};

${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are made from ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};Vous devez équiper ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} pour qu’il ait un effet.${prompt}
Making them is easy. Just equip your ${item-singular: 1[2]}, then go to “Linkshell” in the menu and select “Create Pearl”!${prompt};Allez dans “Linkshell” dans le menu, choisissez le ${item-singular: 1[2]} que vous souhaitez équiper, et vous êtes prêt !${prompt}
All ${item-plural: 2[2]} made this way retain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}'s color and name, so it's easy to tell who can hear you!${prompt};C'est un peu différent d'équiper des armes et des armures.${prompt}
You can make as many ${item-plural: 2[2]} as you want, whenever you want, so don't worry about making too many of them!${prompt};Après avoir fait cela, une icône représentant ce que vous avez équipé apparaîtra à côté de votre nom. C'est là que la couleur que vous avez choisie devient visible.${prompt}
You can also make ${item-plural: 2[2]} with ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} the same way.${prompt};Si quelqu’un vous “vérifie” dans cet état, il pourra voir le nom du ${item-singular: 1[2]} que vous portez.${prompt}
Oh, and...you use your ${item-singular: 1[2]} to make ${item-plural: 3[2]}, too, but it's a little complicated so I'll tell you later.${prompt};Suivez les mêmes étapes pour équiper des ${item-plural: 2[2]} et des ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt}
You have to equip ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for it to have any effect.${prompt};Pour parler dans ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, passez en mode “linkshell” dans votre chat, et tout ce que vous direz sera entendu par tout le monde ayant le même “lien”.${prompt}
Go to “Linkshell” from the menu, choose the ${item-singular: 1[2]} you want to equip, and you're all ready to go.${prompt};Vous pouvez également taper “/linkshell” et taper votre message. La version abrégée est “/l” (minuscule “L” pour “linkshell”).${prompt}
It's a little different from equipping weapons and armor.${prompt};Ah, mais bien sûr, vous devez d’abord avoir ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ou ${item-singular: 3[2]} équipé.${prompt}
After you've done this, an icon that represents what you've equipped will appear beside your name. This is where the color you chose becomes visible.${prompt};Ce que vous direz ne sera entendu que par les personnes ayant le ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ou ${item-singular: 3[2]} avec le même lien.${prompt}
If someone “checks” you in this state, they will be able to see the name of the ${item-singular: 1[2]} you have on.${prompt};Donc, si vous voulez cesser d’écouter votre lien, il vous suffit de déséquiper votre ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ou ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}
Follow the same steps to equip ${item-plural: 2[2]} and ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} peut métamorphoser les ${item-plural: 2[2]} et ${item-plural: 3[2]} d’autres personnes. Bien sûr, cela ne peut affecter que ceux qui ont été fabriqués à partir du même ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
To speak into ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, change your chat mode to “linkshell,” and whatever you say will be heard by everyone who has the same “link.”${prompt};Il existe deux types de métamorphoses, qui sont :
You can also type “/linkshell” and type your message. The shorter version is “/l” (lowercase “L” for “linkshell”).${prompt};1: Transformer en sac / Transformer en perle
Ah, but of course, you have to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]} equipped first.${prompt};2: Jeter.${prompt}
Whatever you say will only be heard by people who have the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]} with the same link.${prompt};Les deux nécessitent que la cible ${item-singular: 2[2]} ou ${item-singular: 3[2]} soit équipée au moment de l’utilisation.${prompt}
So if you want to stop listening to your link, all you have to do is unequip your ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, or ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};La métamorphose “Transformer en sac / Transformer en perle” transforme la cible ${item-singular: 2[2]} en ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} et vice versa.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} can metamorphose other people's ${item-plural: 2[2]} and ${item-plural: 3[2]}. Of course, it can only affect those that were made from the same ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};C’est utile si vous voulez que quelqu’un d’autre se charge de distribuer les ${item-plural: 2[2]} à votre place.${prompt}
There are two types of metamorphoses, which are:;La métamorphose “Jeter” rompt en réalité le lien avec la cible ${item-singular: 2[2]} ou ${item-singular: 3[2]} et la transforme en déchet.${prompt}
1: Make into sack / Make into pearl;Une fois jeté, le ${item-singular: 2[2]} sera cassé et inutilisable...
2: Kick.${prompt};Utilisez ceci seulement en cas d'extrême nécessité !${prompt}
Both need the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} or ${item-singular: 3[2]} to be equipped at the time.${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 3[2]} peuvent également être utilisés pour “jeter”, mais ils ne peuvent affecter que ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}
“Make into sack / Make into pearl” makes the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} into ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} and vice-versa.${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]} et ${item-plural: 3[2]} sont des objets normaux, donc ils peuvent être jetés facilement.${prompt}
It's useful if you want someone else to take care of handing out ${item-plural: 2[2]} in your place.${prompt};Mais en tant qu'objets normaux, vous les perdrez définitivement si vous les jetez.${prompt}
“Kick” actually breaks the link with the target ${item-singular: 2[2]} or ${item-singular: 3[2]} and turns it into junk.${prompt};Cela n’a pas vraiment d’importance s’il s’agit de ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, mais jeter ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} n’est pas une bonne idée !${prompt}
Once kicked, the ${item-singular: 2[2]} will become broken and unusable...;Oh, êtes-vous sûr(e) ?
Only use this in extreme cases!${prompt};Eh bien, si vous avez des questions sur ${item-plural: 1[2]}, vous savez où me trouver !${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 3[2]} can also be used to “kick” but they can only affect ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};(Donc, comme je le disais...)
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and ${item-plural: 3[2]} are normal items, so they can be thrown away easily.${prompt};Votre destin est entre les mains changeantes des vents de Vana'diel.
But as normal items, you'll lose them permanently if you throw them away.${prompt};Je peux vous donner un aperçu de la météo locale.${prompt}
It won't really matter if it's ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, but throwing away ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is not a good idea!${prompt};De quelle région voulez-vous connaître la météo ?
Oh, are you sure?;
Well, if you ever have any questions about ${item-plural: 1[2]} you know where to find me!${prompt};Nulle part.

“Home points” will probably turn out to be among your best companions. Make sure to examine one if you find it, so you can warp between them and cover large distances fast.${prompt};
You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called “home points” for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.${prompt};
There's some special crystal nodes known as “home points” that'll undoubtedly serve you well. Don't forget to interact with all that you find, as they can help you get to far away places.${prompt};

Jackkedy-Wack is what we in Windurst call a “Cardian.”${prompt};
I've placed-waced a marker on your map so you don't get confused! Check-weck-weck it by selecting “Markers” from the “Map” category in the main menu!${prompt};
(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};
Master! What ${choice: 7}[an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there!;

Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!${prompt};

Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!${prompt};
We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo!;
If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your ${item-singular: 3[2]}, when this ${item-singular: 4[2]} just popped out!;
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};

It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;

Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].;
I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.${prompt};
However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.${prompt};
I see that you currently have a trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.${prompt};
You do have the option to terminate your contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.;
Create a new contract with us?;
${selection-lines};
Immediately.;
Not today.${prompt};
Are you certain?;
${selection-lines};
I said, “Immediately.”;
On second thought...${prompt};
You have terminated your trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};
Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.${prompt};
If you happen to create a ${color: 5}high quality${color: 1} version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.${prompt};
Trading us these items will earn you “guild points” which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.${prompt};
The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.${prompt};
When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.${prompt};
I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.${prompt};
If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.${prompt};
You have formed a new trading contract with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};
The current requested item is ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
You have ${number: 0} guild points accumulated.${prompt};
Currently, no items are being requested by the guild.;
You have ${number: 0} guild points accumulated.${prompt};
Is there something you need?;
${selection-lines};

I would like to use my points.;
What are the current limits?;
How does the trade system work?${prompt};
You have ${number: 0} more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.${prompt};
Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.${prompt};
You can still receive up to ${number: 3} guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.${prompt};
You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.${prompt};

${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} can be found along the southern coastline.;
These guys hate the light, so you'd better pack a sleeping bag with your ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
As you can probably tell by its name, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} likes freezing lakes.;

You'll need ${item-plural: 1[2]} to catch them, though...${prompt};
I don't tell many people this, but you can find ${item-plural: 0[2]} living in a certain freshwater deposit in Gustaberg. Try using ${item-plural: 1[2]}...but that's all you're going to get out of little old me...${prompt};
You didn't hear this from me, but a certain ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be caught in the freshwater deposits found in the northern reaches of Quon. You can only use ${item-plural: 1[2]}...no, forget that I said that...${prompt};
Okay, this is only a mystical myth, but I heard that ${item-plural: 0[2]} live in a certain place in northern Quon. They say that the only Tarutaru to catch one used ${item-plural: 1[2]} on his line.${prompt};
I doubt it's real, but some half-crazed angler was telling me about a monster of a fish called the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that lives in subterranean waters of Movalpolos. He also said it feasts on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...and people. Gulp!${prompt};

Interested?;
${selection-lines};
I sure am!;
Not really...${prompt};
I knew it! Nothin' gets a fisherman's blood pumping like tales of legendary leviathans just waitin' to be hooked on your lurrre.;
So let's get rrright to business: head over to Fennella and get yourself a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
You'll have to bait her with some guild points in exchange, but that's nothing you can't reel in, rrright?${prompt};
So be it, but if you have a change of hearrrt, you'll want to come back quickly.;
There may be other fish in the sea, but with all the ardent anglers in the realm, they won't last long!${prompt};
Let's get rrright to business: head over to Fennella and get yourself a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Read over ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, did you?;

Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Well, that's your own choice. Just don't come crying to me when you try to put out a fire with powerful wind magic and end up creating a sea of flames instead!${prompt};
Okay, okay...hold your horses. This is strictly between you and me, all rightaru?${prompt};
Of course, you know about the prime elements, rightaru? They are the eight elements or energies that control the universe. This chart shows their interrelationships.${prompt};
The six elements on the perimeter are in cyclical ascendancy over one another.${prompt};
Or, putting it simply-wimply:;
Water dominates fire,;
fire dominates ice,;
ice dominates wind...${prompt};

earth dominates lightning,;
and lightning dominates water.${prompt};

I can explain more about this if you're interested.${prompt};

Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Then listen up...;
Disease is to fire as paralysis is to ice, silence is to wind as petrification is to earth, and stun is to lightning as poison is to water.${prompt};
Finally, there is charm, which is related to light, while blind, curse, and sleep are infused with the power of darkness.${prompt};
What this all means is this: if your armor resists certain elements, then it will also help prevent the status ailments tied to those elements.${prompt};

Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};

Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;

Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};

We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;

Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};

Could you go and find him in the underground complex and bring him backy-wack for us? Tell him the Sibyl Guards really have their hackles up this time.${prompt};Le ministre a été pris la main dans le sac ! ${prompt}
This is terrible-werrible.;Il faut rester calme et réfléchir.
Semih Lafihna came asking about the mission.${prompt};Sans chef pour l'Académie des Mages, une attaque d'une autre nation ou d'une armée de bêtes pourrait réduire Windurst en cendres.${prompt}
Of course, we explained the mission in a round-a-bout-a-wout way... But she seems to have found outaru the details from some other source.${prompt};Si cela arrive, nous devrions avoir le Docteur Shantotto en première ligne... Non, attendez, nous avons besoin que le Docteur Shantotto soit la dernière ligne de défense de Windurst...${prompt}
Heeber-jeebers!${prompt};Soyez prudent !
What are we going to do!;C'est une zone d'entraînement à la magie.
The minister has been caughtaru red-handed! ${prompt};C'est beaucoup trop dangereux pour le commun des mortels de traîner ici !${prompt}
We need to stay calm and think.;En ce moment surtout, tout le monde est sur les nerfs. Depuis que le ministre a été arrêté par les Gardes Sibylles, l'Orastère est complètement chamboulé.${prompt}
With no leader for the Mage Academy, an attack from another nation or a beastman army would turn Windurst into rubble-wubble.${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui va arriver à notre cher Orastère ? J'en frémis d'avance...${prompt}
If that happens, then we should have Doctor Shantotto on the frontaru line... No wait, we need Doctor Shantotto to be Windurst's lastaru line of defense...${prompt};Nous avons pratiqué jusqu'à l'épuisement sur cette magie de haut niveau... Il semble que le jour soit enfin venu où nous pourrons la mettre à l'épreuve !${prompt}
Be careful, now!;Bien sûr, nous, mages de l'Orastère, allons faire évader le ministre de son sombre cachot. L'Orastère est invincible !${prompt}
This is a magic training area.;Moi, je suis un nouveau venu à l'Orastère. Je rêvais de devenir comme le grand héros respecté Karaha-Baruha, mais dernièrement j'ai pensé à être un peu plus sinistre, comme le ministre Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
It's far too dangerous for your average Joe Blow to be hanging around here!${prompt};M-m-mais, je ne voudrais pas être jeté dans le sombre cachot. Oh, Ministre Ajido-Marujido ! Vous êtes un peu trop sinistre !${prompt}
Now especially-wecially, everyone is a little on edge. Since the minister was arrested by the Sibyl Guards, the Orastery has been completely topsy-turvy.${prompt};...Quelle situation misérable...
Whatever is going to happen to our beloved Orastery? I shudder-wudder to think...${prompt};C'est le moment le plus désespéré de l'histoire de l'Orastère.${prompt}
We've practiced-a-wacticed our fingers to the bone on this high-level magic... It seems the day has finally come where we can put it to the testaru!${prompt};En fait, maintenant que j'y pense, il y a eu un moment pire que maintenant. C'était à l'époque où le Docteur Shantotto était ministre ici...
Naturally, we Orastery mages are going to break the minister outaru of the Dark Dungeon. The Orastery is invince-a-bubble!${prompt};J'ai des frissons rien qu'à y penser...${prompt}
I, I, I'm a newcomer to the Orastery. I, I, I used to dream of becoming like the greataru and respectarued hero, Karaha-Baruha, but lately I've thought about being a little m-m-more sinister, like Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt};Il n'y a pas assez de Sorciers de Guerre pour mener une guerre en ce moment.
A-a-although, I wouldn't wantaru be thrown into the Dark Dungeon. Oh, Minister Ajido-Marujido! Y-y-you're justaru a little too sinister!${prompt};Après tout, cela ne fait que vingt ans environ depuis la dernière...${prompt}
...What a miserable situation...;Même avec tout ce qui se passe, ils envisagent de nous jeter tous, y compris le ministre, dans le sombre cachot !
This is the most desperate time in the Orastery's history.${prompt};Si une guerre éclate, seul la Déesse sait ce qui arrivera...${prompt}
Actually, come to think of it there was a time worse than now. It was the time when Doctor Shantotto was minister here...;As-tu entendu, as-tu entendu ?
I get cold chills just thinking about it...${prompt};C'est juste entre toi et moi, mais...${prompt}
There ain't enuff War Warlocks for us to fight a war right now.;Le Ministre Ajido-Marujido a finalement été arrêté par les Gardes Sibylles !${prompt}
Afta' all, it's only been twenty-odd years since the last one...${prompt};L'Orastère est dans de sérieux ennuis.
Even with all this goin' on, they're thinking of throwing every one of us, even the minister, into the Dark Dungeon!;...Nous, gardes, sommes également affectés par cela, bien sûr, mais les mages de l'Orastère sont dans un état de choc complet.${prompt}
If a war does start, what will 'appen, the Goddess only knows...${prompt};...Ah, euh...
Did you hear, did you hear?;J'aimerais bien discuter un peu plus mais on vous a convoqué à la Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
This is justaru between you and me, but...${prompt};Il s'agit d'un ordre de la Sibylle Étoilée, alors veuillez vous rendre à la Tour des Cieux dès que possible.${prompt}
Minister Ajido-Marujido was finally arrested by the Sibyl Guards!${prompt};Ministre Apururu est la petite sœur du Ministre Ajido-Marujido, n'est-ce pas ?
The Orastery is in a whole lot of trouble-wouble.;Je me demande ce qu'elle pense de tout ça ?${prompt}
...We guards are affected by this as well, of course, but the mages of the Orastery are in a completaru state of shock.${prompt};
...Ah, ahem.;
I would like to chataru a little more but you have been summoned to Heavens Tower.${prompt};
This is an order from the Star Sibyl, so please make your way to Heavens Tower as quickly as possible.${prompt};
Minister Apururu is Minister Ajido-Marujido's little sister, rightaru?;
I wonder what she thinks of all this?${prompt};
Ahem, anyway, please hurry on over to Heavens Tower. The Star Sibyl will be waiting for you.${prompt};

I guess they weren't kidding.${prompt};
Where is this Dark Dungeon, anyway? I've haven't seen it anywhere in town.${prompt};
Hi there, I have a mission-wission from the Optistery for you to tidy up the book vault.${prompt};
With all the ruckus-wuckus around here you wouldn't think the ministries would be issuing missions right now. You gottaru hand it to the Optistery, nothing upsets their routine!${prompt};
With Minister Tosuka-Porika's dislike of Ajido-Marujido though, I guess he's feeling on top of the world about what happened.${prompt};
The Optistery's missions are always difficultaru, but try your bestaru!${prompt};
...All the ministries have been asking for you personally these days.;
I'm glad things are working out for you, but I mustaru say I'm a little jealous!${prompt};

I've been thinking lately that Windurst has an aura of peace and tranquility that other countries lack, but...${prompt};
When it comes down to it, there are so many incidents that occur rrright under our whiskers.${prompt};
...Does this mean that even worse things are happening that we just don't know about?${prompt};
Step right up! Get your missions here!;
...Ahem. This mission has been issued by the Rhinostery.${prompt};
It says here that the Rhinostery needs a handy-wandy with something but there are no specific details. They're probably looking for a research assistantaru.${prompt};
Take yourself to the second floor of the Rhinostery and getaru the low-down from Leepe-Hoppe.${prompt};
The mission statement is about as clear as mud, but if you talk to Leepe-Hoppe at the Rhinostery he should provide you with all the details.${prompt};
I wonder why the Rhinostery would be enlisting research assistantarus by issuing a mission? Usually they just employ one of the Rhinostery-affiliated adventurers...${prompt};

The rrresearchers bring back seeds from plants found near the southern Mithran village. You know, the original seeds used to grow fluoro-flora.${prompt};
This is a little late, but congratulations on reaching rank eight!${prompt};
Well, this is surprising. Your next mission is from the Aurastery. As usual, the teachers from the School of Magic are the ones to set this little task...${prompt};
The objective of this mission is strictaruly confidential, but since it has the Sibyl guards stamp of approval it should be okay.${prompt};
Rightaru, time to get to work!${prompt};
You can ask the details of the mission from the teachers at the Aurastery.;
There mustaru have been some sort of trouble.${prompt};
...But what could've happened?;
Maybe Principal Koru-Moru has vanished as well.${prompt};

Isn't anybody going to do anything about that? My friend in the guild was getting all worrrked up about it.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Rightaru!;
I've finally plucked up my courage, so listen carefully before I lose my nerve.${prompt};
This mission has not been approved by the Sibyl guards. We're not supposed to offer missions without official approval, but this time we're breaking the rules.${prompt};
${name-player}.;
We want you to help Minister Apururu! Go to the Manustery and meet with the minister!${prompt};

You can'taru tell anyone about this mission! If you see any Sibyl Guards, turn tail and run like a rarab!${prompt};

Even with all the guards conspiring together, there are just some things that you can't keep hidden.${prompt};
We won't be able to keep up this charrrade forever, so get it over and done with as quickly as possible.${prompt};
I heard the story from Minister Apururu and Professor Shantotto. You risked all sorts of hazards and hardships to rescue our minister.${prompt};
I wanted to assist you, no mattaru the cost. Without the minister, I wouldn't be where I am today.${prompt};
As for the minister's condition...there's nothing wrong with his physical health, but his mind is being held in thrall by an unknown force.${prompt};
Minister Apururu was stammering so much she could hardly speak, but it seems something unexpected transpired at the Dark Dungeon.;
...With both Minister Apururu and Professor Shantotto here, we shouldn't have anything to worry about, though...${prompt};
Oh, you startled me!${prompt};
Thank you so much!;
I was so worried, my tummy-wummy was doing somersaults.${prompt};
Take this with my thanks.;
Now I have to get this wand fixed!${prompt};
Thank you!;
Now I have to get this wand fixed!${prompt};
The Orastery sometimes has visits from Professor Shantotto, and it was she who saw through the deception. After a single glance at the new wand, the professor blew her top at Hakkuru-Rinkuru.${prompt};
That's just not true, Kuroido-Moroido. She didn't get mad at all... And that's why it's so distressing.${prompt};
Everyone knows how acid-tongued Professor Shantotto is. That very same professor said this to me.${prompt};
“That wand was passed down to Ajido-Marujido from his mother and he holds it very dear to his heart. I pity you, poor Hakkuru-Rinkuru. You'll probably get yourself snapped in half as well!”${prompt};
Oh Goddess!;
I don't want to be snapped in half!${prompt};
Come on Hakkuru-Rinkuru, cheer up. When Minister Ajido-Marujido gets back, we'll apologize to him together.${prompt};
No! Apologizing won't do any good. It'll just be “snap!”, and then me lying there in two pieces!${prompt};
What a lucky break. With Minister Ajido-Marujido in the Dark Dungeon, this wand'll be the least of his worries...${prompt};
Oh Goddess!;
The last time Professor Shantotto was here, she took one look at me and said this.${prompt};
“That wand was passed down to Ajido-Marujido from his mother and he holds it very dear to his heart. I pity you, poor Hakkuru-Rinkuru. You'll probably get yourself snapped in half as well!”${prompt};
Hello, everyone!;
Apururu is here!${wait-animation: 1};
Hello!;
...Oh? Have I interrupted something?${prompt};
No, not at all.;
You seem out of breath, Minister Apururu... Are you here on urgentaru business?${prompt};
No, not particularly.;
Professor Shantotto was at the Manustery today and mentioned that I might want to visit the Orastery from time to time and see how things are going.${prompt};
I thought at first that maybe she was just concerned about everyone here at the Orastery...${prompt};
But that seems unlikely coming from Professor Shantotto. So I figured there must be some other reason for me to come here.${prompt};
Everything appears to be in order though, so I guess I'll be going. Ta-taru～.${prompt};
Now I see what's going on.;
Hakkuru-Rinkuru, you've been completely taken in by Professor Shantotto.${prompt};
She knew all about the history of that wand. What a meanie-beanie, malicious-wicious person she is.${prompt};
...Let me see...${prompt};
This should do it...${prompt};
If Miss Apururu hadn't come along when she did, you would be on your way to the Gates of Paradise by now.${prompt};
Professor Shantotto!${prompt};
...That's not the problem here!${prompt};
Now, now. No need to get so agitated. The situation is not that tragic.;
You're one lucky adventurer to have Minister Apururu to tend to you after having a taste of my magic.${prompt};
...Just because my brother isn't here, doesn't mean you can go around endangering adventurers willy-nilly!${prompt};
No matter how desperate the Orastery is for mages, you don't have the right to use adventurers for experiments. You should know better!${prompt};
It wasn't for an experiment. The brigadier generals were bickering over the Orastery's budget...${prompt};
We had gathered the three wands that the brigadier generals wanted and we were comparing their quality. Then when Professor Shantotto showed up, all this happened...${prompt};
The next budget...?${prompt};
That's just what I wanted to talk to you about. Since he couldn't get in touch with Ajido-Marujido, a shopkeeper in Jeuno contacted me about my brother's purchases.${prompt};
My brother has already used next year's budget. He's bought swords, axes, armor, shields...${prompt};
Huh!? Wait just a momentaru!;
None of those things can be equipped by mages...???${prompt};
Oh, they're not for the mages to use, they're for research purposes apparently. Ajido-Marujido must've have bought them for you boys here in Operations.${prompt};
...Well, that's all I came over for, so I guess it's ta-taru for me! Have fun with your research!${prompt};
What are we gonna do?;
My head is all jumble-wumbled up.${prompt};
Ah, you there!;
You must do something to help the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
The rich old geezer living in Windurst Waters told us to give back the Mana Orb we got from Nanaa Mihgo!${prompt};
He said that the Mana Orb belonged to him.${prompt};
He also said that if we don't give it back, he'll get the boss-woss from the Manustery onto us! We're getting framed as a gang of villain-willains!${prompt};
...But our weal pwoblem is dat we don't got da Mana Orb no more.${prompt};
Do you wemember? Dat Mana Orb got all sucked up into Joker's body.${prompt};
That's rrright. Even if we wanted to, we couldn't give it back.${prompt};
But that old fuddy-duddy won't listen to a word we say!${prompt};
......${prompt};
So now we're really deep in dhalmel doo-doo. The Star Onion Brigade will go from being heroes to zeroes!${prompt};
You're a famous adventurer, aren't you? Can't you think of anything to help us?${prompt};
That rich old geezer living in Windurst Waters told us to give back his Mana Orb.${prompt};
What are we gonna do?;
My head is all jumble-wumbled up.${prompt};
I've heard that that old miser is a rrreal meanie.${prompt};
He says that the Mana Orb belongs to him, but I wonder if that's rrreally true? I don't trrrust him.${prompt};
The Star Onion Brigade is not a gang of villain-willains!${prompt};
That Mana Orb belongs to Joker. It got sucked right into him like it was a perfect fit! It must be his!${prompt};
Da old rich guy dat lives in Windurst Waters is called Honoi-Gomoi, I think.${prompt};
His ancestors were supposed to be a bunch of whiz-bang wizards, so dat's why he's so rich now.${prompt};
If he's got all that money, then he doesn't need the Mana Orb!${prompt};
Only Cardians rrreally need Mana Orbs! Wait, does that mean the old guy is actually a Cardian?${prompt};
They thay that Honoi-Gomoi ith a bad man 'cos hith grandfather'th, grandfather'th, grandfather wath a bad man too.${prompt};
It'th very confuthing, but it'th the truth.;
My mom told me tho.${prompt};
The Star Onion Brigade is gonna take on a grown-up?;
Ohww, they always leave me out!${prompt};
If they keep leaving me out of things, I'm gonna be a grown-up myself soon! And then who am I supposed to play with!?${prompt};
What happened? You went to the old geezer's place?${prompt};
...Hmmm.;
A complete waste of time, huh? All that guy can say is “Give it back! Give it back!”${prompt};
Rightaru, we need to come up with a plan!;
Time for an emergency strategy meeting!${prompt};
Um, order in the court!${prompt};
Let's think of what we can do about Honoi-Gomoi's Mana Orb!;
Does anybody have any ideas?${prompt};
Let's tell him it was gobble-wobbled up by a dhamel in Windurst Woods!${prompt};
That's no good.;
We should say it fell into the ocean!${prompt};
I don't think a grown-up is gonna fall for dat kind of thing.${prompt};
You all know it. Adults are too smart for simple excuses.${prompt};
I've got it!;
We can give him a fake Mana Orb!${prompt};
A fake Mana Orb...;
But how would we make one?${prompt};
...It'th wrong.;
It'th wrong to tell lieth and trick people.${prompt};
Pichichi!${prompt};
The Thtar Onion Brigade isn't about lying or tricking people! It was formed to fight people like that.${prompt};
......${prompt};
You're right!;
The Star Onion Brigade stands for justice!${prompt};
Let's go to Windurst Waters and tell Honoi-Gomoi the truth!${prompt};
Let's go to Windurst Waters and tell Honoi-Gomoi the truth!${prompt};
I can't diss-a-sem-bull Joker, I just can't!${prompt};
What am I going to do...?;
What should we do, ${name-player}?${prompt};
What a selfish old meanie!;
Just because he's rrrich doesn't mean he can go around doing whatever he wants!${prompt};
Didn't his mommy tell him that?;
My mommy's always telling me off for things I shouldn't do!${prompt};
Huh.;
I never would've thought of taking Joker to pieces.${prompt};
Adults always think of the most horrible-worrible things first.${prompt};
I've done some digging on our Mr. Honoi-Gomoi. He's always saying tewwible things, but actually he seems wike a weally nice guy.${prompt};
I found out dat during the Gweat War, he helped pay for twansporting suppwies and for we-building Windurst.${prompt};
After digging a wittle more, I discovered da weason why people call Mr. Honoi-Gomoi a bad man.${prompt};
He organized things so dat da money he lent to Windurst during da war would come back to him as even more money.${prompt};
People whisper dat he used da war as a way of becoming even more rich.${prompt};
If we come acrrross Joker, we can't tell him any of this.${prompt};
It would be such a shock for him. If it was me, I'd be crrrying into my milk...${prompt};
They thay that Honoi-Gomoi ith a bad perthon 'cos hith grandmother'th, grandmother'th, grandmother wath a bad perthon too.${prompt};
Huh? Grandmother?;
It wath hith grandmother right?${prompt};
I can't diss-a-sem-bull Joker, I just can't!${prompt};
On your Star Onion Brigade honor, you can't tell anybody that Joker is hiding in the ghosty house!${prompt};
......;
Going to the ghosty house brings back a lot of memories about Joker.${prompt};
Joker...${prompt};
...I just can't do it!;
There's just no way I can take Joker to pieces!${prompt};
But even if you don't do it, you can bet dat old meanie will find another way to dis-a-sem-bull Joker...${prompt};
Once he finds out where Joker is, he'll probably hire an adventurer!${prompt};
Who knows what he'll do! How can we stop him?${prompt};
...Hey, I know. Why don't we take Joker so far away that Honoi-Gomoi will never-ever find him?${prompt};
Even furtherer away than San d'Oria or Bastok. Somewhere where even adventurers are afraid to go.${prompt};
Yeah! That's a great idea!${prompt};
But dat plan is gonna be awful hard for us to carry out.${prompt};
First we need to find a way to get Joker out of Windurst without anybody noticing.${prompt};
You're rrright.;
If we can't fool the gatehouse guards, Joker will be caught before we can get anywhere!${prompt};
Exactaruly.;
It makes it difficult with Joker being a Cardian.${prompt};
Da gatehouse checks have been much stwicter since a bunch of Cardians kidnapped da old Manustery minister.${prompt};
Joker is one of the good Cardians, but the grown-ups won't understand even if we try to explain.${prompt};
......${wait-animation: 2};
...If we had ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}...${prompt};
...?;
What are you talking about, Pichichi?${prompt};
That time before, when we were uthing gadgetth from the Junior Investigator'th Toolkit, my mom made me ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I gave it to a Cardian who wanted to leave Windurtht. The Cardian became invithible, and was able to get outthide.${prompt};
Mom thaid it was really, really hard to get all the materialth you need to make one, tho she wathn't going to make me any more.${prompt};
Aha!;
It's your turn to shine again, adventurer! Go talk to Pichichi's mom and get all the materials she needs!${prompt};
You want to help Joker, right? We need that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Okay!;
Let's get Joker out of Windurst before anyone discovers his hiding spot!${prompt};
Pichichi's mom will make the gadget we need, so it's your job to make sure she has all the materials!${prompt};
Joker's hiding spot in da House of da Hero is tip-top secwet information.${prompt};
You never know when someone may be wistening, so don't mention it to your friends, your family, or even your pet worms!${prompt};
Pichichi's mommy has a hostel in Windurst Waters, rrright?${prompt};
But before she started her business, she trrraveled all around Vana'diel. Does that mean Pichichi's mommy used to be an adventurer?${prompt};
We're not gonna let anyone hurrrt our Joker!${prompt};
Joker is a member of the Star Onion Brigade! No matter the danger, we don't abandon our frrriends!${prompt};
I wonder where that Cardian that I helped went to?${prompt};
He thaid he wath going on patrol, tho I gueth he'th traveling all over the plathe. Thoundth like fun.${prompt};
I wonder why Honoi-Gomoi wants that particular Mana Orb so much?${prompt};
I wouldn't want to become a hard-headed old man like that for all the gil in Vana'diel. No one would like me.${prompt};
Nya～h!;
I'm keeping a lookout!${prompt};
So this is ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Pichichi's mom has come through for us again.${prompt};
Heh-heh, my mom can do ANYthing!${prompt};
Okay, let's get this to Joker...${prompt};
...Aah!;
Aaaah!;
Aaaaaaaah!;
At last...I've found you. Hear me Tarutaru and Mithra, I will take back the life of our king.${prompt};
You have no need of that. If you don't return it to us...${wait-animation: 3};
You can say goodbye to your friend.${prompt};
Dammitaru!;
Let her go!${prompt};
I'm not afraid of you, you don't scare me at all!${prompt};
We're not afraid of you!${prompt};
Fools...;
Why are people such fools...${prompt};
Let this be a lesson to you...${prompt};
...Enough.;
Joker!!!${prompt};
It was those children that brought me back to life.;
Let the girl go.${prompt};
Your Majesty!${prompt};
Your Majesty!${prompt};
We have long awaited the return of our king.${prompt};
Aces. I have returned. And there is a task that I must perform.${prompt};
We understand.;
We live but to serve you, your Majesty.${prompt};
We live but to serve you, your Majesty.${prompt};
Then let us be gone.;
This is not where we belong.${prompt};
...Jo, Joker...${prompt};
...Joker!;
You can't go! Those Cardians are evil!${prompt};
They're not your friends!;
We're your friends! You can't leave with them!${prompt};
Thank you, my friends.;
I will always be a member of the Star Onion Brigade.;
I promise that one day I will return to stand at your side.${prompt};
“Never break a promise.”;
Add this to the rules of the Star Onion Brigade.${prompt};
It'll be added, all right, so don't even think of breaking it!${prompt};
Remember, you promised!${prompt};
Joker...${prompt};
Don't...;
Don't you break your promise...${prompt};
The ghostie is gone.${prompt};
He thaid he would come back, tho I gueth he'll come back.;
...I wonder if he'll come back tomorrow?${prompt};
I can't believe da ace Cardians came all da way into da city...!${prompt};
Dere's no way dey could've come in through one of da gates...;
I wonder how dey got in?${prompt};
I was too frrrightened to move.;
I don't know what we would've done if Joker hadn't come to save us.${prompt};
I'm glad little Shanruru is okay. After today, we should make her a full member of the Star Onion Brigade.${prompt};
Was Joker rrreally friends with those bad Cardians? He didn't seem like a bad Cardian at all.${prompt};
Did he go with those Cardians even though he didn't want to? If that's the case, we have to go rrrescue him!${prompt};
Wowzie-powzie!;
Those bad guy Cardians were totally intimidating! They were way more scary than Nanaa-Mihgo!${prompt};
Man! If I were a grown-up wizard, I could have saved everyone with my magic! Why do I still gotta be a kid?${prompt};
I was s-so s-scared.${prompt};
I thought I was gonna be squished for sure!${prompt};
I had to pinch my cheek to make sure I was still alive!${prompt};
Now my cheek kinda hurts!${prompt};
...Ah!;
Something happened while you were gone...!${prompt};
...Actually, forget about it.;
I don't wanna talk about it right now.${prompt};
I'm not thad at all.;
He thaid he wath coming back. Right?${prompt};
No mattaru how much I wack my bwains, I can't figure out how dey got in.${prompt};
Hey!;
Where have you been!?;
You're never gonna be a grrreat adventurer if you turn up late all the time!${prompt};
My head is still spinning.;
I want to talk about what happened, but I don't even know where to starrrt.${prompt};
Man, if only I was a grown-up wizard! Star Sibyl, make me an adult now, I don't want to wait!${prompt};
I was s-so s-scared.${prompt};
I thought I was gonna be squished for sure!${prompt};
...Where have you been?;
While you were gone, all sorts of crazy stuff happened...${prompt};
If we'd had an adventurer with us, things might have gone differently... You let us down on this one.${prompt};
Before I tell you what happened, you have to help us make ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
My mom made me ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} when we were collecting all the gadgetth for the Junior Invethtigator'th Toolkit.${prompt};
But I ended up giving it to a cardi-wardian who wanted to get out of Windurtht. The Cardian uthed it to go invithible and thneak out.${prompt};
Getting the materials to make this gadget is no easy feat. We need to find ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, a very val-u-a-bull item.${prompt};
If you get Pichichi's mom to make us ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, we'll tell you all the exciting stuff that happened while you were gone.${prompt};
If you get Pichichi's mom to make us ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, we'll tell you all the exciting stuff that happened while you were gone.${prompt};
You brought the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!;
Okay, fair's fair, I'll tell you what happened to us.${prompt};
We we here trying to think of a way to protect Joker from that mean-old Honoi-Gomoi in Windurst Waters.${prompt};
Our plan was to use that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} you brought us to help Joker escape to a place far, far away from here...${prompt};
But then, these bad guy Cardians showed up out of nowhere!${prompt};
...And then, Joker...;
He gave us this...${prompt};
Joker made a promise.;
He said he will be back one day. So don't go losing this badge, okay!${prompt};Si nous avions eu un aventurier avec nous, les choses auraient peut-être été différentes... Tu nous as déçus sur ce coup-là.
...Where have you been?;Après ton départ, ces Cardians méchants sont apparus de nulle part !
While you were gone, all sorts of crazy stuff happened...${prompt};Je ne trahirai jamais une promesse !
If you can bring us ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, I'll tell you what's been going on...${prompt};J'ai risqué ma vie en voyageant depuis Vollbow pour vous apporter ces excellents produits !
...Where have you been?;Où est mon envoi en provenance de Vollbow ? C'est terrible pour mon image en tant qu'importateur respecté...
While you were gone, all sorts of crazy stuff happened...${prompt};Vous pouvez regarder, mais ne touchez pas ! Et n'oubliez pas, cassez-le, achetez-le !
If we'd had an adventurer with us, things might have gone differently... You let us down on this one.${prompt};Vous avez entendu parler des Hautes-terres d'Elshimo, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, si vous attendez une minute, j'aurai un envoi de marchandises qui arrivera à tout moment.
After you left, these bad guy Cardians showed up out of nowhere!${prompt};Oh, ${name-player} !
I'll never break a promise!${prompt};Ministre Apururu vous demande !
I've risked my life traveling all the way from Vollbow to bring you these fine goods!${prompt};Elle est allée à l'Orasterie chercher les vêtements magiques du Ministre Ajido-Marujido, donc je suppose que cela signifie qu'il est en voie de guérison !
Where is my shipment from Vollbow? This is terrible for my image as a respected importer...${prompt};'...Ah, moi et ma grande bouche de goobbue ! Je dois vraiment apprendre à parler moins fort !
You can look, but don't touch! And rememberrr, you break it, you bought it!${prompt};...<chuchotement>...
You've heard of the Elshimo Uplands, haven't you? Well, if you'll hold on a minute, I'll have a shipment of goods coming in any time now.${prompt};...Ministre Apururu vous attend à la Manustérie...
Oh, ${name-player}!;
Minister Apururu is asking for you!${prompt};
She went to the Orastery to fetch Minister Ajido-Marujido's wizardly wear, so I guess that means he's on the road to recovery!${prompt};
...Ah, me and my big goobbue mouth! I really need to learn to keepy-weep my voice down!${prompt};
...<whisper>...;
...Minister Apururu is waiting for you at the Manustery...${prompt};

Is it rrreally true that drrroves of Cardians have been spotted walking across Sarutabaruta? We've been getting all sorts of rrreports from adventurers.${prompt};
Isn't the Cardians' base supposed to be in the northwest tower? Where could they be headed to?${prompt};
Hey, did you hear?;
Our minister's been pardoned for his crimes!${prompt};
These events have made me realize justaru how great Minister Ajido-Marujido really is! His title should be more like the “Amazingly Magnificent Minister Ajido-Marujido!”${prompt};
The timely return of the minister has saved the Orastery Mages from a collective case of stomach ulcer-wulcers.${prompt};
If he had come back any later, who knows what awful chores we could have been sentaru on by a certain schemey-weeming Tarutaru?${prompt};
Be careful, now!;
This is a magic training area.;
It's far too dangerous for your average Joe Blow to be hanging around here!${prompt};
Everyone's spells have become a little over-wover-enthusiastic since we heard that the Star Sibyl had forgiven Minister Ajido-Marujido.${prompt};
I can't vouch for your safety in the Orastery rightaru now. Of course, it's never been that safe in here to begin with...${prompt};
Have you seen Minister Ajido-Marujido around? As usual, he's nowhere to be found in the Orastery.${prompt};
I was hoping to try out the next level of destructo-dealing dweomers sometime soon, but I'm not sure if I'm ready. I need to ask the minister's opinion.${prompt};
I, I, I'm a newcomer to the Orastery. D-d-doctor Shantotto has been visiting the Orastery all the t-t-time lately to give us nasty-wasty chores to do.${prompt};
Now that w-w-we're finally being f-f-freed from her naggy-waggy orders, I feel so...${prompt};
Hmm? That's w-w-weird. I think I'm g-g-gonna miss it a little...${prompt};
It looks as though the Star Sibyl hadn't given up on the Orastery after all.${prompt};
And now we finally have permission to carry on with the work of the great genius, Karaha-Baruha. Isn't that greataru?${prompt};
The research of the great Karaha-Baruha ultimately led to 'is death.${prompt};
Does that mean the Star Sibyl means to just stand around while Minister Ajido-Marujido offs 'imself?${prompt};
Your mission today is from Heavens Tower!;
I have the mission statement with your name on it rightaru here.${prompt};
The Yagudo have sentaru a proposal demanding a revision of the peace treaty. You should make your way over to Heavens Tower immediataruly.${prompt};
...Hm?;
This doesn'taru have the Star Sibyl's emblem on it. Did she justaru forget, I wonder?${prompt};
A revision of the peace treaty between Windurst and the Yagudo...;
In what way would they wantaru it revised?${prompt};
What bother-wothers me is this isn'taru just a simple revision of one of the clauses. Are they looking for a complete rewrite of the entire treaty?${prompt};

Will the Star Sibyl acquiesce to their demands again?${prompt};
This is just between you and me, but the Mithra are thinking of taking the fight to the Yagudo. We're not gonna let them get away with rrravaging our land any longer.${prompt};
Hey ${name-player}, how've you been!? I'm so glad I gotaru the chance to see you again!${prompt};
The Star Sibyl, the Sibyl Guards, Miss Apururu, Minister Ajido-Marujido... Everyone in Windurst is so grateful for what you have done. ${prompt};

Windurst will become a country that we Mithra will trrruly be able to call home.${prompt};
And it's all thanks to you that this golden age has arrived. Heehee, you're kinda cute when you blush!${prompt};
In the name of forging the mages of the Orastery into a fit fighting force, a terror-inspiring plan of Code E proportions is underway here in Windurst!${prompt};
And that plan is known as the Martial Mages Mortal Mashfest! Mages will competaru in a no-magic, no holds barred, club-swinging free-for-all!${prompt};
Wah! How dreadful-weadful!${prompt};
The organizer of this gladiatorial extravaganza-wanza is taking advantage of Minister Ajido-Marujido's absence to completaru the preparations.${prompt};
And what's more, that very same organizer is thinking of including a deathmatch between adventurers and mages of the Orastery!${prompt};
Gah! How gruesome-wuesome!${prompt};
In the case that our multiple countermeasures fail before Minister Ajido-Marujido returns and the Mashfest actually takes place, we here in the Operations Division have come up with alternative preparations.${prompt};
With everyone's help, we have created this magical club.${prompt};
I entrustaru this club to you, and ask that you smacky-whack away until its magical power has been depleted.${prompt};
Such a wonderfully designed weapon. While swinging at your enemy with the club, you have a hand free to hold a shield in defense...${prompt};
As opposed to the reckless-weckless organizer of this event, who's likely to charge in flailing a staff with both hands...${prompt};
The club that you were given has been empowered with a special-wecial magic. Please use it in battle until the spell on the club has faded. Was there something else?${prompt};
Was there something?;
${selection-lines};
No, nothing else.;
I lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...;
I give up.${prompt};
Lucky for you, the boys here in Operations think of every contingency. Here's a new club for you.${prompt};
Oh, you really wantaru give up? We had such a greataru reward waiting for you, too...${prompt};
Do you still wantaru give up?;
${selection-lines};
No more clubbing for me.;
I guess I could club some more...${prompt};
I see... Even an adventurer like you has to be afraid of that person. I don'taru blame you!${prompt};
Please disposey-wose of the club so you won't be connected with the goings-on here at the Orastery.${prompt};
We have a splendid-wendid reward for you after your task is done. Don'taru give up, now!${prompt};
The spell upon the club still remains. The magic will fade once the data has been fully-wully recorded, so keep on clubbing!${prompt};
Good work. We've managed to compile-wile some useful data from your efforts.${prompt};
Now, aboutaru your reward. It's not something that everyone can use, so we mustaru test your suitability first.${prompt};
Now, now, don't get all fluster-wustered. We're not intending to sendy-wend you into the jaws of death to keep our plans secret.${prompt};
Here. Prove your strength to us by thump-whumping a monster in a special place in Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
Bring us ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} from the monster you defeataru, and we'll consider you worthy to receive the reward.${prompt};
The reward we will give you is extremely-wemely special. Prove to us you can use it by testing your mettle in Ro'Maeve.${prompt};
And don'taru forget to bring back ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to prove you have defeated the monster.${prompt};
Amazing! You've returned victorious!${prompt};
For your reward, I will teach you a super-secret club technique passed down through the Orastery for generations. This ultimate technique was developed as a lastaru resort for when all magic has been exhausted.${prompt};
We are mostaru grateful for your assistance. Use it wisely.${prompt};
Now that you've passed the final test, we can tick off that box on our listaru of things to do.${prompt};
We've also collectarued some enlightening data from some highly skilled people.${prompt};
The opponents that the organizer will send against us will mostaru likely be toppity-notch combatants... Without the data collected from powerful adventurers who have completed our test, we wouldn'taru be in any position to compete.${prompt};
Rightaru. Now all we need to do is have Apururu's help in feeding this data into the Cardians.${prompt};
I bet Doctor Shantotto will be surprisey-wised to see Cardians representing the Orastery.${prompt};
But nobody said we couldn'taru use Cardians, and they are proper members of the ministry!${prompt};
They say that the firstaru step to deceiving your enemy is to start with your friends... Since nobody else knows about this plan, they're all still diligently practicing their club skills. It's perfectaru!${prompt};
Hmmm.;
But when you think about it, everyone's being forced to brush up their club technique anyway...${prompt};
You know, putting the sinister-winister will aside, the existence of Doctor Shantotto actually contributes to the improvementaru of the Orastery.${prompt};
Being a ministry with an often absentaru minister, we need to be kept on our toesy-woes.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
With Doctor Shantotto around, I'm just glad I have toesy-woes left to be kept on!${prompt};
You have learned the weapon skill “Black Halo”!${prompt};
What's this supposed to be? ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 1[2]}...?${prompt};
Hey! This is Joker's Mana Orb! What have you done with our Joker!?${prompt};
But doesn'taru that mean...${prompt};

Joker can't be dead!${prompt};
Joker wouldn't go and die on us, rightaru?${prompt};
He promised that he would come back.;
He promised!${prompt};
Doeth thith mean... Mithter Ghothtie ith back?${prompt};
Yeah, Pichichi. Joker said he would come back to us.${prompt};
Oh! Mithter Ghothtie hath come back! And he'th come back really big thith time!${prompt};

I'll be watching over you...${wait-36: 3};
I have returned to this land...${prompt};
Joker!;
Joker! Jo～ke～r!${prompt};
Can you hear me? You finally came back to us!${prompt};
Listen, Joker! We'll be watching you as well! The sky, the town, the people... We'll be keeping an eye on things!${prompt};
Don't ever forget us! Don't forget the friends of justice, the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
Joker came back to us. He kept his promise!${prompt};
He's not a Cardian anymore, but we can still recognize him. The Star Onion Brigade is whole again!${prompt};
Truth, justice, and the onion way! Defenders of love and dreams! We are the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
I think Mithter Ghothtie hath become a grown-up now.${prompt};
That'th why he wath tho big!${prompt};
He'th tho big now that we can't even thee him anymore. But we know he'th there. He glowth tho brightly.${prompt};
I've heard dat Mana Orbs are filled with de energy of dis land.${prompt};
When dat energy is weleased, it weturns to the land. I wonder if dat's why we can feel Joker's pwesence all over de place.${prompt};
I know what I'm gonna do.;
I'm gonna solve dis mystery some day. And den I'm gonna spend de west of my life pwotecting dis land and its sparkling energy!${prompt};
It's all tingly!;
I'm tingling from my tail to my whiskers to the tips of my ears!${prompt};
Everyone must've felt that huge wave of energy that swept acrrross the world! That energy was Joker!${prompt};
All those twinkling stars! It was so prrretty!${prompt};
Joker's become a grrrand wizard! Or maybe a grrrand wizard had been turrrned into Joker?${prompt};
I wonder, if I grow really-weally hugey-wugey and reach up to the sky, I'll be able to talk to Joker again?${prompt};
I'm gonna grow absolutaruly ginormous!;
Bigger than a Mithra! Bigger than a Galka. Even bigger than an Elvaan! I'm gonna grow up to be a giant!${prompt};
I'm Shanruru, a member of the Star Onion Brigade. Pleased to meet you!${prompt};
They let me into the S.O.B. to help find Joker. But now that we know where Joker is...${prompt};
Now I get to huntaru down villains! I'm gonna be a defender of Windurst's peace!${prompt};

I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.${prompt};
Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times:;
Match 1: ${earthtime: 0};
Match 2: ${earthtime: 1};
Match 3: ${earthtime: 2}${prompt};
Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of ${number: 0} gil is required before each match.${prompt};

What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Basic rules.;
Official/private matches.;
Flammen-Brenner.;
Flamme.;
Match score.;
Petras and quarrying.;
Sprint.;
KO.;
Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
Extra! Extra! Hear all about it!♪;

Don't tell anybody, but I've managed to get my hands on some items from Tavnazia! Take a look!${prompt};

In Bibiki Bay there be a place known as Purgonorgo Isle.;
On this island lives a mighty strange character that won't listen to a word we has to say.${prompt};
All the islands in that bay belong to us here at the Fishermen's Guild, but that scurvy-wurvy dog insists that Purgonorgo Isle be his, an' his alone.${prompt};
We've tried talking it out all civil-like, but things have gotten out o' hand.;
We've even been settin' monsters on each other in place of talking...;
Who knows what we'll be facing next!${prompt};

Ye go see if ye can talk some sense into him!${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Sure, matey.;
Not today, matey.${prompt};
We lost our last encounter, so if the Fishermen's Guild doesn't win this next round, our name'll be mud on the high seas!${prompt};
The next “debate” is set to take place in the middle o' Purgonorgo Isle.;
Don't ye be losing now, matey!${prompt};
That warmachine slipped you this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
It don't matter how many pieces of trash he hands over, we won't be giving in!${prompt};
It looks to me like a deed written in Mithran style.;
That kinda feline legal jargon-wargon's got nothing to do with us Tarutaru.${prompt};
He's telling us to take our battle to the Mithra boss!${prompt};
Just a fish-pickin' minute there.;

She should be able to tell us if this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is the rrreal deal.;
Off ya go.${prompt};
Get yerself to Attohwa Chasm an' find that Mithran Tracker. She should be able to tell us if it's the real deal.${prompt};
That paper smells kinda fishy.;
I'm telling ye, it's a fake!${prompt};
Ye're back, matey.;
What did ye find out?${prompt};
Hrm...;
So this turned out to be a pirrrate's tale after all.;
Better for us to keep our whiskers clean of this one.${prompt};
What nonsense be you speaking!?;
This not be the guildmaster I know!${prompt};
Ain't ye always telling us there's no place on the seas fer a coward!?${prompt};
It's not the pirrrates I'm afraid of.;
This herrre dispute could escalate into a prrroblem between Windurst and Kazham.${prompt};
You be talking daft!${prompt};
There's been ties between Windurst and the Mithran pirates for a good long while now.;
Little arrrguments like this one have come close to causing full-scale war.${prompt};
And since none of us want to cause a warrr, I think it's best we step back and see what happens.${prompt};
I'm not givin' up on Purgonorgo Isle, but it's smarrrter to let the Mithran Trackers handle this.${prompt};
Well, adventurer, herrre's a little somethin' for ya trouble.;
Thanks for ya help.${prompt};
Arrgh!;
If Windurst wasn't in cahoots with the Mithran pirates, we'd be able to get on with our battle!${prompt};
I had me next strategy all worked out fer kickin that warmachine right off the island!${prompt};
...Now, just a second there, matey.;
Who was inside that warmachine, anyhow?${prompt};
Arrgh!;
A name shoulda been written right there on the deed!;
I just can't remember...!${prompt};
Hey!;
You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right?;
Take this letter to that ${choice: 2}[cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?${prompt};
Excuse me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady].;
Would you take this letter to the ${choice: 2}[guy/lady] in the red hat?${prompt};
Adventurer-${choice-player-gender}[man/lady]!;
Could you take this letter to that funny ${choice: 2}[guy/lady] in the red hat?${prompt};
"I would like to take this letter to a certain ${choice: 2}[fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?${prompt}";
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!${prompt};
Whoa!;
Thanks, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/lady]!${prompt};
Thank you so very much, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]!${prompt};
Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!${prompt};
Wow! Another present!;
Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?${prompt};
Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent?;
You're starrrting to scare me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]...${prompt};
I just accepted a gift from you, kind ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.${prompt};
${color-alt: 131}You've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!${prompt};

Huh? You want a tree of your very own?;
I don't know... Making those things takes a lot of work, and as you can see, I'm a busy woman.${prompt};
Now, if you scratch my back, on the other hand, I have no problem scrrratching yours.${prompt};
Listen up.;
You're looking at Vana'diel's premiere holiday tree craftswoman. My work's so renowned that the Federation called me all the way from my townhouse on Elshimo to build them four hundred trees.${prompt};
Unfortunately, my assistants all collapsed after eating too many pickled rarab tails, leaving me in a proverbial pickle. Now I barely have time to scratch my fleas, let alone pick up my supply orders from all over town.${prompt};
If you help me with my project, I might be able to find the time to whip you together a real nice tree for your Mog House. What do you say? Do we have a deal?${prompt};
Help her out?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
Not today.${prompt};
That's too bad...;
I make one sweet tree...${prompt};
That's a good sport!;
Now get your tail in gear and get down to the ${color: 5}market moogle${color: 1} in front of the port residential area!${prompt};
You have ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours].;
And if you're not back in time, no tree. Got it? Good!${prompt};
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and fetch my supplies from the moogle in front of the residential area! Time's flying and you don't have a swatter!${prompt};
Well, well, well! Look who's back with the goods!${prompt};
This should tide me over until my assistants check out of the hospital.${prompt};
Here, take this special tree. You earned it!${prompt};
What took so long, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]? I thought I told you to hurry!;
Anyway, here's your next errand: rush over to the residential area in Windurst Waters and pick up my order of supplies from the market moogle. You have ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours]. Now, go!${prompt};
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and fetch my supplies from the moogle in front of the Windurst Waters residential area! Go go go go!${prompt};
I was wondering when you'd return... Don't tell me I didn't give you enough time!;
Oh well, here's your last task. Dash up to the market moogle in front of the Windurst Walls residential area and collect my order of sensitive materials. Double time!${prompt};
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and fetch my supplies from the moogle in front of the Windurst Walls residential area! And no catnapping on the job!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Oh, hello there.;
Why do I look so down? Well, it turns out that my assistants are going to need surgery... And all this from a super-size order of pickles. Can you believe it? If I don't find someone to help me out quick...${prompt};
Really? I knew I could count on you!;
Now rush over to the Waters District and grab my supplies! I'll give you ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours]!${prompt};
Alright!;
Now sprint on up to the Walls District and pick up my materials! I'll let you have ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[hour/hours]!${prompt};
You never let me down, do you!;
Here's your reward!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
I'm pretty sure I told you to hurry... Have you been exercising lately?;
Maybe you can come back to help after you've gotten into a little better shape...${prompt};
Maybe I shouldn't have eaten those leftover pickles...${prompt};
When is that Mithra going to come and pick up her pie, kupo...?${prompt};
Wait a minute, you don't look like the Mithra that ordered this pie, kupo...;
Eh, I guess I can trust you. Here you go!${prompt};
I gave you all I had, kupo... Unless you want the fur off my back!${prompt};

Eh? You say somethin'?;
Hmph! You dang kids these days ain't got no respect for your elders. Can't you see I'm tryin' to learn this new fandangled fishin' method? In my day, all we had to do was cast a line and wait for the baby to tug. Why, back then it was so easy, I could catch fish while I was sleepin'!${prompt};
But now you gotta work for your meal! Let me tell you how it's done...;
First, you fix a little bait on your line, toss it into the water, and wait for somethin' to bite. Eh? What's changed? Well, nothing yet! Would you just hold your horses and let me get to the good part?${prompt};
Now, once you feel the pull is where the real battle begins--and I say battle because that fish is not going to let you get him without a fight! If he starts tuggin' to the left, you've gotta pull to the right. If he starts tuggin' to the right, you've gotta pull to the left.${prompt};
Keepin' centered--that's the key to tirin' out that old puppy! And once you think you've softened him up enough, that's when you reel him in. If you ${color: 5}confirm${color: 1} a little too early, the fish may still have enough pep to run off with your bait. But if you spend too much time playin' with him, he might just get bored and be on his way.${prompt};
Of course, if you ever get a bad feeling that whatever's on the end of your line's fixin' to snap your rod in two, you could always ${color: 5}cancel${color: 1} your way out of things......sissy!${prompt};
Alright, did you get all that? Well, keep listenin', 'cause I'm not done yet.;
This new type o' fishin' works differently with different types of rods.${prompt};
Those fancy carbon and glass rods may have what it takes to keep a fish on your line for a long time, but the flexibility of good old-fashioned wooden rods packs enough punch to tire out any fish in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
But enough of this chitchat. If I don't catch somethin' for tonight's dinner, my wife'll clean me, gut me, and have me in a fryin' pan faster than you can say Galka meuniere!${prompt};
A little while back, the Fishermen's Guild's ship party was crashed by a trio of wandering comedians.${prompt};
But they were so boring, me mates preferred to pitch themselves over the side than listen to another joyless joke!${prompt};
We figured we'd be doin' Vana'diel a favor if we just marooned those jesters on an island.${prompt};
This was no deserted island, ye understand. This was Purgonorgo Island in Bibiki Bay.;
There's a mighty strange character living there who don't take orders from no one.${prompt};
This was no deserted island, ye understand. This was Purgonorgo Island in Bibiki Bay.;
Those humorless hucksters can earn a livin' entertainin' the sole inhabitant.${prompt};
That stubborn seadog should be sufferin' their puerile puns as we speak!;
Gwahahahaha!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Nothing happens.${prompt};
Oh! It's ${name-player}!${prompt};
An untested audience!${prompt};
We'll give you some candy if you stay and listen to our performance!${prompt};
Welcome to the Chebukki Show!${prompt};
Hey, did you hear?;
We toppled a titanic terror and saved the world!${prompt};
All in a day's work, you might say.${prompt};
Of course, it wasn't easy pretending to be under our enemy's control so we could take him by surprise.${prompt};
Makki, you were mak-nificent!${prompt};
Kukki, you were too kooky!${prompt};
I think it's about time I exited stage left...${prompt};

An adventurer called ${name-player} thinks that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] stole the show!${prompt};

${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] so mean!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] so terrible!${prompt};

Are you kidding me...?${prompt};

Are you laughing at us!?${prompt};
Hey! Why aren't you laughing?;
How rude!${prompt};
It's time we showed our artistic temperament!${prompt};
Meee!;
Teee!;
Ooor!;
Where did these striplings learn such powerful magic?${prompt};
What hell did you assassins spawn from!?${prompt};
Spawn!?${prompt};
Assassins!?${prompt};
How rude!;
We're the stars of the Chebukki Show!${prompt};
I don't care if you're the king of San d'Oria's royal bedmakers!;
Your magic won't work on me!${prompt};
My wife blasted me with Meteor so many times, I don't even feel it anymore!${prompt};
You're way out of your league!;
Bring it on, you horrific harlequins!${prompt};
Then how about tasting the Meteor our mom used to make!${prompt};
Let him have it!${prompt};
Meeeeee!;
Teeeeee!;
Oooooor!;
I think we overdid it again...${prompt};
Well, he asked for it.${prompt};
We sure showed him who's boss!${prompt};
Uuugh!;
Oooh!;
Oooh!?;
The Chebukki Show...?;
The Meteor your mom used...?${prompt};
Could it be?;
My darling children!?;
Makki, Kukki, and Cherukiki!?${prompt};
Does this mean...!?${prompt};
Could it be...!?${prompt};
This weird guy is...!?${prompt};
Your father!${prompt};
Daddy!;
Dad!;
Father!${prompt};
Hey, what about me!${prompt};
There, there.;
You must have been so lonely out there on your own.${prompt};
From now on, you'll live here with me.;
I'll never let you go again.${prompt};
Daddy!;
Dad!;
Father!${prompt};
This is just wonderful.;
But wait...;
One thing is not quite right!${prompt};
I've always dreamed that you would call me “Papa.”;
Can you do that for me?${prompt};
Papa!;
Papa!;
Papapaaa!${prompt};
You'll have to excuse this outburst of emotion.;
Even ex-bounty hunters have their soft spots, you know.${prompt};
I mean to live out the rest of my life with my children, happy and safe.;
For the moment, we'll be staying here on the island.${prompt};
As you know, I'm a target for some pretty nasty characters.;
They could come after me again at any time.${prompt};
When that time comes, I may need your help.${prompt};
But there's something more important that needs to be said.${prompt};
Children.;
We should show our appreciation to this adventurer for bringing us together.${prompt};
Let me hear you say “thank you.”${prompt};
Thanks, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr. Meanie/Miss Meanie]!${prompt};
Thanks, ${choice-player-gender}[Mr. Terrible/Miss Terrible]!${prompt};

“Magic Paradise Weekly” is chock-a-block full of the latest news in Windu～rst!♪ Our next issue contains a special feature on the latest talk of the town--the “Salaheem's Sentinels”!${prompt};
The buzz is that the head of the company is a woman who'll knock your socks off!${prompt};
Extra! Extra! Hear all about it!♪;
This international news bulletin has been brought to you by “Magic Paradise Weekly”!${prompt};
Have you seen anyone from the mercenary company yet?;
Apparently, they'rrre from the “Empire of Aht Urhgan.”${prompt};
You may think they seem trrrustworthy, but take my word for it--with a face like that, they've just gotta be thinking criminal thoughts. You'd best be carrreful.${prompt};
Hey, isn't that a mercenary badge?;
It has magical powers, right? Must be nice!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Mojo-Pojo's badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
I, I, I wish I could go to the Near East as a m-m-mercenary...${prompt};
Maybe I could hit it b-b-big there, just like Karaha-Baruha...${prompt};
Twenty years 'ave passed since the last war, but I wonder if something is stirring elsewhere...${prompt};
The current generation knows nothing of war, though.;
Battles in faraway lands may be a mere fantasy to you...${prompt};

Wow, I've never heard that before. You know everything, Grandpa!${prompt};
Huh? Oh, a customer!;
Happy New Year!${prompt};
What? Who was I talking to just now? Oh, the other day, this really nice old man gave me my very own ${item-singular: 0[2]} so I could call him whenever I wanted. He teaches me all sorts of things, and all I have to do is call him “Grandpa” and do whatever he says.${prompt};
Just now, he was telling me about the fun-loving people walking around outside.;
I heard that something similar to this happened many years ago...${prompt};
He also told me that if I give 'em something, they'll give me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in return.;
I really wanted one, so I was all ready to go through that gate over there when the guard gave me a nasty loxok...${prompt};
Hey. You're an adventurer, right? Doesn't Altana say that you guys have to help little kids or your brain will melt and bugs will eat your ears? Go out and get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ASAP. Don't worry, you'll get your reward!${prompt};
Whoa! You really brought me back ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Thanks!${prompt};
I guess you'll be wanting your reward now, huh? Hmmm... How about I give you a choice?${prompt};
I'll...;
${selection-lines};
Let you ask Grandpa a question.;
Give you something from my pocket.;
Tell you more about Grandpa.${prompt};
Eh? That's all you want?;
Well, okay.${prompt};
Hold on. I'll see if I can get through. Grandpa has a lot of little friends just like me, so his line is always busy.${prompt};
Oh, hi Grandpa!;
Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Sure... Uh-huh... Yeah... Okay... Sure... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... No, but... Yeah... Okay... Uh-huh... Right... Uh-huh... Not really... Sure... Okay... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... I can do that... Uh-huh... Great... Yeah... Sure... Uh-huh... No... Not today... Maybe tomorrow... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Wait... Actually, the reason I called was because there is this adventurer who wants to ask you a question.${prompt};
Ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name? Okay.;
${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Lady], what's your name?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} points to the name over ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] head.;
The ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] says ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name is ${name-player}. Think we can believe ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt};
Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...${prompt};
The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.${prompt};
Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some “bravery” and “drive” onto your resume. Go figure!${prompt};
The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.${prompt};
And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.${prompt};
Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.${prompt};
In other words, you're a smart ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!${prompt};
The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.${prompt};
Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.${prompt};
In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.${prompt};
The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.${prompt};
Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!${prompt};
The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.${prompt};
Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.${prompt};
In other words, that “pristine balance” helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!${prompt};
The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.${prompt};
And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!${prompt};
The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.${prompt};
Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.${prompt};
In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!${prompt};
The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.${prompt};
Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!${prompt};
The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.${prompt};
Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.${prompt};
The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.${prompt};
Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!${prompt};
Uh-huh...;
Uh-huh...;
Yeah, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.${prompt};
You want me to tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that, too? Alright.;
Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...${prompt};
Whatever that means. I don't understand half the stuff he says, but I like him because he gives me candy.${prompt};
I knew it. You adventurers are all alike.;
Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.${prompt};
You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.${prompt};
He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some big white contraption...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about it not costing so much when he was younger...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some huge-mongous tree...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about traveling back and forth...${prompt};
He said the same thing yesterday, so he may still be in the same place. Are you thinking about going and getting some candy, too?${prompt};

This week's schedule:;

Physical training (1300 gil).;
Rest (1500 gil).;

Never mind.${prompt};
All you want for your chocobo this week is the minimum level of care? There is no charge for this service, but it will not help your chocobo grow...${prompt};
An emphasis on exercise, is it? Your chocobo will run and build leg strength with this program.${prompt};
Physical training, is it? Your chocobo will spend time exploring outside and digging with this program. It should help your animal build a strong beak and claws.${prompt};
Giving your chocobo a rest will allow it to recover from accumulated fatigue and restore a great deal of energy.${prompt};
Choose this program?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Understood. Your chocobo is in good hands with us this week.${prompt};
Changed your mind? When you decide on a program, please let me know. If there is no word from you, we will continue to give your chocobo the minimum level of care.${prompt};
You seem to be raising your chocobo well.${prompt};
It does not seem to have any serious illness or sudden changes in temperament. Everything looks to be in perfect order.${prompt};
All that you have been providing for your chocobo is the minimum level of care. As a result...${prompt};
Your chocobo's legs are a bit stronger than average...${prompt};
But its overall physical strength is a bit lower than average.${prompt};
Come back any time. Your chocobo is counting on you!${prompt};

You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...${prompt};

Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.${prompt};

The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.${prompt};
They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.${prompt};
Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt};
They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt};
The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt};
But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!${prompt};

“Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt};
You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt};
“Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt};
You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt};
If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt};
“Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt};
However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt};

A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt};
How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt};
You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt};
When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt};
With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt};
The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt};
You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt};
The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt};
However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt};
We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt};
Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt};
Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt};
However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt};
But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt};
The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt};
You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
A general explanation.;
Watching over your chocobo.;
Telling a story.;
Scolding.;
Competing.;
Taking a walk.;
Nothing.${prompt};
In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt};
On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt};
However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt};
You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt};
You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt};
I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt};
Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt};
This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt};
Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt};
I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt};
Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Why feeding is important.;
Vegetables.;
Wildgrasses.;
Carrots.;
Worms.;
Medicines.;
Pastes.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt};
However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt};
The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt};
At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt};
Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt};
There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt};
Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt};
This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt};
Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt};
Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt};
In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt};
Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt};
Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt};
For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt};
But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt};
The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt};
Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt};
A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt};
Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt};
You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt};
Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt};
Which would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Abilities.;
Temperament.;
Weather preferences.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt};
For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt};
Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt};
But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt};
The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt};
Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt};
Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt};
Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt};
You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt};
After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt};
When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt};
You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt};
The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt};
You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt};
When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};
Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.${prompt};
If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Chococards.;
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}.;
Nothing.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.${prompt};
With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.${prompt};
If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt};
You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt};
The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt};
Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt};
Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt};
If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt};
Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt};
If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};

Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping soundly at night.${prompt};
I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.${prompt};
I will dispose of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!${prompt};
As you say, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...${prompt};
I gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was but a chick.${prompt};
I am afraid ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust me more than you...${prompt};
You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.${prompt};
I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
You would like to tend to this egg?${prompt};
We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It will not be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
"Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} no longer seems lonely.${prompt};
...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?${prompt};
I am not sure what to say to that!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been behaving quite spoiled as of late. You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wanted attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I am sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love, but it is feeling better now and its appetite has returned. Everything should be all right.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! I wonder what kind of name you will choose...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it awakens.${prompt};
Your chocobo should grow accustomed to its name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We have been taking good care of your egg. I cannot wait to see how the chick will look.${prompt};
We have been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It has been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It appeared to be having pleasant dreams...${prompt};
I took the chocobo on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} exercised with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${wait-35: 8}${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a child...${prompt};
...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}? Oh...oh yes! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. It enjoyed playing to the crowds...${prompt};
However, it got a bit too carried away, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for San d'Oria.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, San d'Oria was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, San d'Oria awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You would not believe what it has found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but turned up with very few items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but did not seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. You should spend it wisely.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding your egg.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is all for now. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let us analyze your egg's current condition...${prompt};
Let us analyze ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s current condition...${prompt};
I cannot tell yet whether the chocobo will be male or female.${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo is...a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Discernment: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg does not seem to be in the best condition at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can provide it with proper care.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because West Ronfaure is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt}${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The La Theine Plateau is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should not grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Jugner Forest. Being together such a long time should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for San d'Oria, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What is this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?${prompt};
You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I can't do it anymore.;
No, I want to continue.${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?${prompt};
Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?${prompt};
If you decide to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Give up raising your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No!${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
What would you like to say?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...${prompt};
Is that so? That is a proper attitude...${prompt};
...;
I am disappointed in you.${prompt};
You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.${prompt};
I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
Are you sure you want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?${prompt};
Really retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, really!;
No, I've changed my mind!${prompt};
Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.${prompt};
Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, is it not? But have no fear...you can see it again. Keep your chin up.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I shall prepare ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
The preparations will cost ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
I have your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You may take it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I can give you a new one, but it will cost you ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And do not worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I have been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}...;
What is this all about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...${prompt};
The owner's name begins with the letter ${choice: 0}[C/L/V].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[a town information guide/a watchman/someone who delivers parcels/a merchant].${prompt};
I will do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I have gathered new information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up a moment ago. I am glad that we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions.;
Might I trouble you to choose another combination?${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.${prompt};
Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...${prompt};
I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
I think that should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby.${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is becoming one fine bird, if you ask me!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. You can get one at the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're already raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
So you'd like to tend to this egg, eh?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... Let's make a fine chocobo out of this one.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Isn't it cute? You can name it later.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a hassle when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!${prompt};
You've done a great job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air. You're a natural at this!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal!${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
"But don't worry; this won't be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. You should probably feed it better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you, eh?${prompt};
...I've got no comment on that.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm really sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I'm happy to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know it had you worried sick, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must've missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I'm sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love. Everything should be all right now... Its appetite has returned and it appears to be feeling better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! Have any great ideas?${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up.${prompt};
I am sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how the chick looks.${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It's been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much, it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been out playing with the children of Bastok. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Eh?;
Oh yeah, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it.${prompt};
We put your chocobo on exhibition. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really played to the crowds...${prompt};
But it was a little too aggressive, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Bastok.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Bastok was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, Bastok awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but didn't turn up with many items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I still can't tell whether the chocobo will be male or female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. Your chocobo is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue. You should not disturb it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes, too.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love with another chocobo.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because North Gustaberg is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Konschtat Highlands are not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Pashhow Marshlands. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Bastok, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's that? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any longer?${prompt};
Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}...;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};
I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt};
I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt};
I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt};
So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then! From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Come on, cheer up! This won't be your last meeting!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?${prompt};
Hey, don't look at me for an answer... I don't speak Chocobo, you know!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately! It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
Wow...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems really bored! You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems happier lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm so sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away! Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and it seems okay!${prompt};
I know you were just beside yourself with worry, but you should welcome your chocobo with open arms. It must've missed you a lot!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting weird lately. Its head is in the clouds and will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. That should cheer it up!${prompt};
It seems your chocobo was in love! Now it seems cheerful again and is eating like there's no tomorrow, so I guess things are back to normal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! What'll it be?${prompt};
Oh! Your chocobo likes its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time!${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how cute the chick will be!${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo has been passing its time here in the stables without a concern in the world!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made it a bit more patient!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of Windurst. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Oh...oh! Yes, of course, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} enjoyed it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it!${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. Your chocobo really played to the crowds!${prompt};
But it was a little too much sometimes, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Windurst.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Windurst was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
But it got lost sooo many times!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
Windurst compensates you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it!${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} dug for hours, but it hardly found anything!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was great! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't even know its role! It just caused trouble for the other actors.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}! I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}! What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I can't tell yet whether your chocobo will be a male or a female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days/ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care!${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it!${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you should discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love!${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing!${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all... I guess it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because East Sarutabaruta is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Tahrongi Canyon is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Meriphataud Mountains. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with some gil as thanks for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Windurst, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's this? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any more?${prompt};
What? You want to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you'll never ever see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again! You really don't mind?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Do you have anything you have to say for yourself?${prompt};
I guess if that's what you really want... Custody of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for it?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? This must be hard on you too, huh? Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? Then don't forget it!${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you stick with it through to the end!${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should stick with it to the end!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse!${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Well, all right... Then ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Here, let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I'll be needing from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}!;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hi, ${name-player}!;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / / /G/ /K/P].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].${prompt};
I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!${prompt};
That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Oh dear...;
You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions.;
You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.${prompt};
First, we must test the level of trust between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.${prompt};
I'm sure even ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hides things while you are not around...${prompt};
Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.${prompt};
If you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is completely absorbed in its current activities.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Search for the chocobo's item.;
Watch over the chocobo.${prompt};
You find something in the ground.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} appears to be very happy.${prompt};
Kweh!!!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} noticed what you were doing...${prompt};
You gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, didn't you?${prompt};
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.${prompt};
I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.${prompt};
One of the workers at our stable gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, right?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...${prompt};
At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.${prompt};
Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to want out...${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks happy to see you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't look very happy...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is in high spirits.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks irritated.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping peacefully.${prompt};
You feel a faint warmth in the room left behind by ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Now feeding the chocobo...${prompt};
${number: 1}: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
${name-player} gives the chocobo its food.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has found something!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems interested in your story.${prompt};
Which would you like to talk about?;
${selection-lines};
Random chitchat.;
An impatient chocobo.;
A curious chocobo.;
A worrisome chocobo.;
A youthful chocobo.;
A happy chocobo.;
A diligent chocobo.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem to understand your story...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is inspired by your story.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hangs its head in shame.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} awakens from its sleep.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is still fast asleep...${prompt};
Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!${prompt};
W-wow... You're pretty fast!${prompt};
Th-this is absurd...${prompt};
You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!${prompt};
This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...${prompt};
That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!${prompt};
Now have you learned never to underestimate ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}?${prompt};
This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!${prompt};
It's a tie!${prompt};
Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...${prompt};
Hmph. If ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!${prompt};
Luck was simply not with us today...${prompt};
Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?${prompt};
Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} just fine!${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};
Keh!${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} becomes friends with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} here...${prompt};
You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with ${entity: 1}...${prompt};
Good day to you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.${prompt};
I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?${prompt};
Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?${prompt};
What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!${prompt};
We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!${prompt};
Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.${prompt};
Foudeel is working on its intelligence.${prompt};
And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!${prompt};
Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?${prompt};
Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.${prompt};
Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?${prompt};
But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.${prompt};
Hey, I remember you!${prompt};
I'm glad you're taking the time to take ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!${prompt};
Oh, there you are!${prompt};
Glad to see you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out on walks! Keep it up!${prompt};
Well, what a coincidence.${prompt};
I'm glad to see that you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
Well, well!;
Fine meeting you here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I am pleased to see that you are taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!${prompt};
Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!${prompt};
Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo...${prompt};

Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?${prompt};
Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.${prompt};
Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.${prompt};
But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!${prompt};
It looked like he wanted me to take him out...${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};

Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch.;
This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.${prompt};
I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.${prompt};
Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.${prompt};
How about you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]?${prompt};
If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in ${choice: 0}[Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Sign me up!;
Not today.${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}!;
You are now an official member of the CRA's ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
I see.;
Please come back if you ever change your mind!${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Why race chocobos, anyway?;
How do I register for a race?;
How do I prepare for a race?;
What are ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}?;
What kind of races are there?;
What are “racing teams”?;
Quit.;
Return.${prompt};
Why not!?;
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};
You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt};
Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt};
Join this team?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!${prompt};
Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.${prompt};
Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.${prompt};

----------------------------------------;
★Free Run★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: None${prompt};

Here is the information on the next race:${prompt};
★Novice Race I★;

This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.${prompt};
★Novice Race III★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you.;

The promenade.;
Chocobet centers.;
The grandstand.;
Portals.;
Guides.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.${prompt};
It can be found just south of here.${prompt};
The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt};
Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt};
There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt};
All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt};
The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt};
To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt};
The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} will be provided anytime you purchase ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or sign up for a race.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.${prompt};
This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt};
As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt};
For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished.;
Your cooperation is appreciated.${prompt};
Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.${prompt};
They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.${prompt};
This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.${prompt};

Racing teams.;
Race rules.;
Race types.;
Victory points.;
Race Progression.;
That's about it.${prompt};
A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt};
Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt};
In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt};
For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt};
The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt};
What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt};
Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt};
The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt};
The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt};
The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt};
In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt};
Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt};
Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt};
For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt};
We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt};
No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt};
Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt};
As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt};
Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt};
Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt};
The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt};
As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt};
Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt};
Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt};
Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt};
Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt};
What would you like to hear more about?;
${selection-lines};
Race preparations.;
Signup procedure.;
Collecting winnings.;
Signing up for another race.;
I'm fine, thanks.${prompt};
There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt};
First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt};
Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt};
Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt};
All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt};
A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt};
Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt};
There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt};
There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt};
Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt};
In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt};
The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt};
You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt};
To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt};
The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt};
You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt};
After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt};
This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt};
We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt};
What would you like to ask?;
${selection-lines};
What is chocobetting?;
How do I bet?;
What are odds?;
When do I bet?;
How do I collect winnings?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt};
To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt};
Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};
And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt};
Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};
The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt};
To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt};
For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt};
We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt};
Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt};
Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt};
It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt};
What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt};
Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt};
The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt};
Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt};
Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt};
Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt};
Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt};
Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt};
Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt};

With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt};
As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt};
“The Monster Races”!${prompt};
Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt};
Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.;
What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};
The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.;
It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt};
Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.;
If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;
Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.;
Thank you for your understanding.${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt};
We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.;
The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt};
Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.;
And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt};
As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.;
It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.;
Consider yourself warned.${prompt};
In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.;
Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.;
It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt};
Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.;
These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt};

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.${prompt};
Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...${prompt};
...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt};
Good day, fol--${prompt};
ピヨ！${prompt};
Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt};
Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt};
First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt};
ピヨピヨ！${prompt};
She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt};
She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt};
She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt};
She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt};
She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt};
She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt};
She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt};
She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt};
Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt};
Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt};
Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt};
Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt};
ピヨ～♪${prompt};
Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt};
The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt};
She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt};
She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt};
She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt};
And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt};
And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt};
The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt};
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.;
And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...;
...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!;
Good day, fol--;
ピヨ！;
Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.;
And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!;
#${number: 4}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]};
#${number: 5}: ${chocobo-name: 1[2]};
#${number: 6}: ${chocobo-name: 2[2]};
#${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]};
And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!;
Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!;
I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt};
Yeah...;
Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt};
And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt};
Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt};
They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt};
Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt};
As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt};
${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt};
Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt};
Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt};
And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt};
ピヨッ！${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt};
a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt};
This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt};
Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt};
We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt};
Well, there you have it.${prompt};
Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen!;
President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt};
...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt};
Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt};
Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt};
Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt};
The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt};
Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt};
So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt};
Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt};
Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt};
My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt};
We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt};
Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt};
Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt};
What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt};
Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt};
Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt};
Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt};
Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt};
Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt};
And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt};
Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt};
Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt};
Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt};
The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt};
When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt};
When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Markovich, what did you think of the start?;
Well, I fel--;
ピヨピヨッ！;
Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.;
Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
And as they pass the halfway mark...;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!;
${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!;
While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!;
Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!;
And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!;
ピヨピヨ！;
Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed is approaching dangerous limits!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed has begun to drop off!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!;
The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!;
The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!;
The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!;
And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
And now they're approaching the final corner!;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!;
The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!;
What's this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
And it's ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!;
Let's take a look at the results...${prompt};
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt};
There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt};
Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt};
Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt};
Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt};
What an amazing race!;
The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt};
What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt};
The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt};
Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt};
Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt};
Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt};
The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt};
And there you have it.;
This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt};
And now, let's see the results from the last race.;
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1});
And that's all she wrote, folks!;
The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!;
Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?;
She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!;
She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.;
Until next time, race fans...;
Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt};
Taking the crown for today's race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
To the winning steed's owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt};
And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt};
Excellent race, ${name-player}!;
You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt};
Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt};
Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt};
But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt};

With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};
Oh...?;
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};
Is that so...?;
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};
But that's not where it ends!;
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;
But...${prompt};
But...?${prompt};
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};
I see...;
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};
But enough talking, I say.;
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};
Oh, yes, right...;
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};
Whoopee!;
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};
Erm...yes...;
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};
My, oh my...!;
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};
A-ahem!;
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;
<Sniffle>${prompt};
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Hrmmm...;
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};
And won't you look at the lineup!;
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};
Huh?;
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};
<Gulp>;
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};
Um...Professor Shantotto...;
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};
Ohohohohoho!;
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};
H-hey!;
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};
And you, Goccilo!;
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;
Until next time...!${prompt};
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};
What's with the baffled expression?;
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
But something seems to be different...;
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};
And that completes the lineup, folks.;
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};
But no more...;
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};
Well I'll be...;
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;
Congratulations!${prompt};
Great race, ${name-player}.;
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};
Princess...;
Princess Sakura!${prompt};
Princess...?;
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};
Searching for...me?${prompt};
Yes, Your Highness.;
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};
Are you serious!?;
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};
That is correct.;
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};
...!;
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};
Wh...what happened?${prompt};
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};
So that's what happened...${prompt};
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};
Your Highness!;
But...why!?${prompt};
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};
What's more...${prompt};
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};
What...?${prompt};
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;
I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt};
I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt};
Heehee!;
Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt};
${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!;
Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt};
You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt};
What?;
How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt};
Hohoho...;
It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt};
I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt};
Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?;
No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt};
Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt};
<Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.;
But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt};
You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.;
To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt};
And you, our new Chocochampion!;
Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt};
Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.;
These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Hrmmm!;
${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!;
Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?;
All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.;
But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.;
Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!;
And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!;
The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;

Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!;
And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!;
I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step.;
And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!;
And here's some unexpected drama, folks!;
The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?;
Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!;
Uh-oh, what's going on here!?;
The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!;
Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!;
What's this!?;
All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!;
Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!;
That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!;
Never in all my days, race fans!;
In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!;
How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?;
In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!;
Shantotto starts casting Tornado!;
The speed of the chocobos has dropped!;
The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!;
The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!;
Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?;
What in the world do you think you're doing!?;
Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.;
This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.;
What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?;
I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.;
This could get heavy, folks!;
All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.;
Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?;
It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!;
There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!;
More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!;
And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!;
The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.;
This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!;
This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.;
Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!;
And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!;
Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!;
And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!;
But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?;
I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!;
Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?;
It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!;
The time for a final spurt is now or never!;
And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?;

Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt};
It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.;
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.;
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;
Let's see here...${prompt};

Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!;
What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt};
Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!;
Ain't synergy grand?${prompt};
Wait! No, don't tell me.;
You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt};
Learn about synergy?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
Teach me!;
Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.;
Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt};
I thought you'd never ask!;
Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt};
Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt};
What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;Bienvenue au service de porteurs du MHMU, kupo !
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;De quel fardeau puis-je vous décharger aujourd'hui ?${prompt}
How's that for a deal?${prompt};Besoin d'aide, kupo ?
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};Service de porteurs ?
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};Acheter un coupon de stockage.
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;Non, merci.${prompt}
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};Votre sac de gobbie déborde-t-il de partout ? Votre Mog Safe déborde-t-il ?
Do something, kupo?;Eh bien, un aventurier accompli comme vous a sûrement plus de choses qu'il ne sait quoi en faire.${prompt}
${selection-lines};C'est là que j'interviens, kupo.
Porter service?;Je me ferai un plaisir de prendre en charge vos biens précieux, vous libérant ainsi de l'espace pour rassembler des objets encore plus grands.${prompt}
Buy a storage slip.;Pour utiliser mes services, vous devrez d’abord acheter l’un de ces coupons de stockage pour la modique somme de ${number: 19} gils.${prompt}
No, thank you.${prompt};Les coupons de stockage sont disponibles en plusieurs variétés, kupo, chacun correspondant à un type différent d’objet.${prompt}
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;Vous voudrez examiner de près les petits caractères, afin de ne pas dépenser de bons gils pour un morceau de parchemin inutile pour l’objet particulier que vous souhaitez stocker.${prompt}
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};Pas que nous, moogles, refusions ce genre de don, kupo.${prompt}
That's where I come in, kupo.;Choisissez l'objet que vous souhaitez me confier, puis échangez-le avec moi ainsi qu'un seul coupon de stockage.
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};Je prendrai l'objet et vous rendrai le coupon, marqué d'un sceau invisible.${prompt}
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};Invisible pour vous, du moins.
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};C'est aussi clair que le jour pour nous, les moogles, alors ne pensez même pas essayer de nous tromper, kupo.${prompt}
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};Quand viendra le moment de récupérer votre objet, échangez-moi à nouveau un seul coupon de stockage - n'importe lequel - kupo.${prompt}
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};Je vous présenterai une liste de tous les objets actuellement en ma possession, et vous pourrez choisir celui que vous souhaitez retirer.
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;Aussi simple que ça, kupo !${prompt}
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};De plus, aucuns frais de transaction supplémentaires ne seront engagés !
Invisible to you, at least.;Plutôt généreux de notre part pour une fois, non ?${prompt}
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};Maintenant, je parie que vous vous demandez quel est le piège, kupo.
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};Pour ne pas vous décevoir, il y en a quelques-uns !${prompt}
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;Pour commencer, tous les objets signés perdront leur signature si vous les stockez chez moi.${prompt}
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};Pourquoi, vous demandez-vous ? Hé, même nous, les moogles, ne sommes pas parfaits !
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;Il vaut mieux pour nous deux que vous gardiez vos objets les plus précieux à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};Maintenant, écoutez bien, car il y a un autre piège, et c'est un sacré.${prompt}
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;Si vous perdez votre coupon de stockage, je ne pourrai pas vous rendre votre objet. Jamais. Pas de “Je suis désolé, Monsieur le Moogle Porteur, cela ne se reproduira plus !”
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};Les règles sont les règles, kupo, et quelqu'un doit les respecter.${prompt}
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};Enfin, et ce n'est pas le moindre, je ne peux pas accepter d'équipement portant l'insigne d'essai Magian.${prompt}
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;Si vous avez un tel objet que vous mourrez d'envie de me confier, vous devrez abandonner votre essai d'abord, kupo.${prompt}
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};Et c'est tout ce qu'il y a à dire.
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};Ce modeste moogle a hâte de vous servir, kupo !${prompt}
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;Acheter quelque chose ? (p. ${number: 16}/${number: 17}).
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};Page précédente.
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};

Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather?;
You'd be wise to make a habit of taking stock of your ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} prior to departure.${prompt};
The function of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is twofold.${prompt};
First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.${prompt};
Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.${prompt};
A single stone is good for a ${number: 1}-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to ${number: 2} can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.${prompt};
One thing to remember is that a good twenty hours (Earth time) are required to fully charge one stone. As such, I might not always have one on hand. I must beg your patience in that case.${prompt};
Here for your ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}?;
Let me see what I have for you...${prompt};
Hm? Why, it appears you already have ${number: 2} stones.;
I'm sorry, ${name-player}, but it'd be irresponsible of me to furnish you with any more. Heavens forbid I have a hand in stranding you in a foreign world.${prompt};
Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have any fully charged stones for you right now.;
Could you check back again in a while?${prompt};
Here you are, ${name-player}. That should suffice for the time being.${prompt};
With the power of cruor, it's possible to teleport to any cavernous maw serving as a gateway to Abyssea. You only need to have visited that maw once before.${prompt};
If you wish to go somewhere, a quick word with my assistant beside me here and you'll be off to your destination in the blinking of an eye.${prompt};
It'll take me ${number: 4} more ${choice-plurality: 4}[minute/minutes] (Earth time) to fully charge another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};

Ah, it seems you have insufficient cruor to make that journey.${prompt};

These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes.;
Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.${prompt};
I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos.;

Need something?;
${selection-lines};
Assist with replenishment.;
Assist with upgrades.;
Martellos? Come again?;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort.;
To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} into the structure.${prompt};
Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and ${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Take along the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations.;
Best of luck in your efforts!${prompt};
Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?;
You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt};
I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?${prompt};
You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in its stead!${prompt};
Your support is most heartening in these dark times.;
Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.;
You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.;
Be careful out there!${prompt};
Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?;
You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt};
Is that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} I see?;
Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt};
Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.;
How did you fare in your efforts?${prompt};
I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?;
It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt};
The resistance greatly values your contributions.;
Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt};
I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.;
Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt};
Ask something?;
${selection-lines};
So, what's a martello?;
Martello replenishment.;
Martello upgrades.;
Cautionary notes.;
Not now.${prompt};
The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.;
Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt};
You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt};
In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.;
Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt};
That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt};
I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.;
Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.;
Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?;
Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt};
An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.;
Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt};
Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.;
As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.;
Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt};
Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt};
'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Warning:;
Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.;
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.;
The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.;
Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} breaks!;

Very well, friend.;
Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.${prompt};

Quotha...the light that shines forth from thy soul hath brightened a considerable degree.${prompt};
Natheless, it remaineth but a dull glow akin to twitherym dust whenas compared to the blindingly refulgent souls of more accomplished combatants.${prompt};
To fulfil thy true potential, thou needs assume the role of gladiator and bathe in monipulator blood.${prompt};
As a monipulator, thou hast likely reduced opponents everywhere to bawling babes at the mere mention of thy name.${prompt};
Simultaneously, though, combatants who hath cut swaths through adversaries while inside bestial vessels betimes yearneth for more...to bite the hand that feedeth.${prompt};
A saga sung of those who instill terror and those who release the land from it...;
Bwahaha, a worthy tale of spiritual strife, forsooth.${prompt};
Now that the stage hath been set, I shall impart the extent of my gladiatorial knowledge to thee. Simply ask and thou shalt receive.${prompt};
What shall you ask about?;

Those who have the ambition to slay monipulators can do battle against them by speaking with ${choice: 1}[me/my Northern San d'Orian ally] or one of my brethren in either ${choice: 2}[Port Bastok or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Bastok] and receiving ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};

While it doth provide myriad boons to thee, it preventeth not those outside thy coterie from interfering with thy duty. Such a benediction will only descend upon the yare souls who hath claimed monipulators as their prey.${prompt};
I must also caution thee to beware that, depending on thy level of expertise, it may not behoove thee to tread upon the soils of certain lands.${prompt};
Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to me and I shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.${prompt};
Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to one of my compatriots and they shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.${prompt};
Three ranks doth serve to classify the world's monipulator executioners. There is the eponymous “gladiator (Gla),” “champion gladiator (CG),” and “high champion gladiator (HCG).”${prompt};
Naught else needs be explained anent this simple concept...save that a gladiator's rank is determined by his prestige.${prompt};
Prestige is the gladiator's equivalent of the common adventurer's fame.${prompt};
Defeating both monsters and monipulators increaseth thy prestige, while falling victim to their claws decreaseth it.${prompt};
Each rank also hath a corresponding maximum amount of prestige, much like the infamy of monipulators.${prompt};
Ascertaining thy current prestige is merely a trifle.;
(Access the “Profile” menu under “Status.”)${prompt};
Of course, prestige is not simply a means by which to boast to thy inferiors. Thou canst cede it to me in exchange for troves of splendid rewards.${prompt};
No victory doth taste as sweet as one where the stakes are high. Flaying treacherous notorious monsters and high notorious monsters occasionally earns thee spoils of war.${prompt};
A little cockatrice told me that monipulators even relinquish equipment betimes, so hold not back from slicing, stabbing, and spellcasting thy savage enemies to smithereens.${prompt};
Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics.${prompt};
Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics by my consorts.${prompt};
Athwart terrestrial beings such as thee, our mezzotinting process leaveth nary a scratch on extant arcane glyptics.${prompt};

Forget not that we must have ${item-plural: 0[2]} in order to engrave arcane glyptics, lest thou wish to incur the wrath of my people.${prompt};

Though monipulators and gladiators art diametrically opposed, thou mayest shift alliance betwixt both sides of the conflict as thy humors see fit. There cannot be good without evil, and the sides shall for all eternity be in stasis.${prompt};
Good and evil, monipulator and adventurer...they are but two sides of the same coin.${prompt};
Oh, how I yearn to assume the form of a monster in the same manner as thee. Wellaway, I must be content with mine empty husk of a vessel.${prompt};

Thank you for delivering this to me, even though it's so far out of your way-way-way.${prompt};
...Pardon me, but did you already open-wopen this?${prompt};
I understand that knowledge is power, but it's also a dangerous-wangerous thing--especially when driven by avarice-rice-rice.${prompt};
I can tell you're a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of integrity, seeing as how the seal is still intactaru.${prompt};
One would think such atrocities were unfathom-wathomable, but perhaps we should just learn to live amidst this chaos-os-os.${prompt};
Well, let's cut to the meat and potatoes-toes-toes. May I have a momentaru to read this?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
You should note that my expertise is status ailmentarus, not mysterious devices or runes-runes-runes.${prompt};
Still, I think I know what the issue-wissue is.${prompt};
...But first, you can use runes, rightaru?;
Try talking to me after you unleash the power of Ignis-nis-nis.${prompt};
I thoughtaru you were a rune fencer-cer-cer.;
Or maybe you just misheard me. I said “Unleash the power of Ignis,” not “Don't do a damned thing.”${prompt};
I take it you had to try a hundred times to engrave your firstaru rune? Because that's not Ignis.;
At least it's a rune, though-though-though.${prompt};
Yes, that's exactaruly what I wanted to see!${prompt};
So, here's my idea-dea-dea.;
Each of those contraptions is aligned with a specific-wific elementaru...${prompt};
Therefore, perhaps you could utarulize your runic aptitude to solve this riddle-dle-dle.${prompt};

Afterwards, examine-wamine the apparatus from front to back-back-back, top to bottom, inside and outaru.${prompt};

Fine, but don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're a remedial studentaru.${prompt};

Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt};
Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt};
“Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt};
Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt};
Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt};
Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt};
You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt};
Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt};
The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt};
Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt};
Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt};
“Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt};
These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt};
Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt};
Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt};
A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt};
Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt};
Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt};
When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt};
Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt};
No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt};
You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt};
An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt};
One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt};
A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt};
You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt};
Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt};
Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt};
Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt};
The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt};
It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt};
The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt};
Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt};
These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt};
Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt};
Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt};
You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt};
This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt};
This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt};
However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt};
Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt};
Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt};
Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt};
On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt};
Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt};
Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt};
Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt};
Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt};
A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt};
Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt};
A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt};
It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt};
Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.;
${color-alt: 138}The A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.;

Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.${prompt};
But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...${prompt};
And I am unable to remain here in 884.${prompt};
My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.${prompt};
Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt};
But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.${prompt};
May your steps remain swift and true.${prompt};
Head for...the palace...${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.${prompt};
But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.${prompt};
I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.${prompt};
If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!${prompt};
Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!${prompt};
Master...forgive me.${prompt};
Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.${prompt};

Luzaf...I wish you were here...${prompt};
Please...help me...${prompt};
Razfahd must be stopped...${prompt};
Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...${prompt};
I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.${prompt};
I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.${prompt};
Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.${prompt};
The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt};
Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt};
Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt};
Old gods? New?${prompt};
No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt};
We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.${prompt};
And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.${prompt};
There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.${prompt};
Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt};
And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt};
Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt};
But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt};
For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt};
Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt};
Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt};
It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt};
I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt};
All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt};
An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt};
I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt};
Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt};
I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt};
When I fell before you...${prompt};
...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt};
I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt};
And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt};
This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt};
Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt};
Open your eyes and witness the truth!${prompt};
Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?${prompt};
Is this a dream?;
${selection-lines};
What else could it be?;
No. It's something more...${prompt};
Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt};
A keen eye, as always.${prompt};
The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt};
As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt};
I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt};
And those...${prompt};
...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt};
I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt};
Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt};
And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt};
You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt};
At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt};
Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt};
So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt};
One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt};
Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt};
False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...;
The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt};
Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt};
Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt};
Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”;
Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt};
No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt};
...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt};
You must not. You cannot.${prompt};
Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt};
Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt};
There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt};
You are the culmination of all your experiences.;
Even those who are gone still depend on you.;

Master--the orb.${prompt};
You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.${prompt};
Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.${prompt};
He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt};
I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?${prompt};
What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt};
We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.${prompt};
Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.${prompt};
And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...${prompt};
The future should have changed...${prompt};
...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.${prompt};

Hm? I can talk about status changes all day, oh, all day-day-day. However, I have no clue about something as old as this...${prompt};
If it is from the ancient peoples, then I suppose if you take it to the mysterious device we researched earlier, you might get even better results.${prompt};
Of course, if you go and find nothing, it's not my responsibility-bility-bility.${prompt};
Hm? Did things go well-well-well?${prompt};
I was just trying to engage in pleasantries, but if things went well, that is quite exciting-ting-ting.${prompt};
Yes, yes... Good for you-you-you.${prompt};
Hmm? Hmmm? What now?${prompt};
Hey! I reme～mber that!${prompt};
My doll!;
Oh, it's yours, huh...${prompt};
Thank you so much! The Mithra who took it treated it so terribly!${prompt};
Ah! You mean during the Mithra Thief Spy～ing Incident!${prompt};
The thief a～lways gets away before she can be caught, so we decided to go spying!${prompt};
And we found out all about Nanaa Mihgo because of Shanruru, too!${prompt};
Me? A spy?${prompt};
I guess you did tra～il her...or was it that you were found out along the way?${prompt};
Well, I was able to find this wonderrrful ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} because Shanruru got caught!${prompt};
But I dropped my doll somewhere along the way...${prompt};
That'th why she tried to cheer you up!${prompt};
I think I deserve some prrraise for getting this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Ah! That ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ${choice: 1}[/is still under investiga～tion/is still a secret]!${prompt};
What's ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Can you eat-weat it?${prompt};
It's part of a letterrr of some sort. But it's too hard for me to read.${prompt};
I bet an adult can read it!${prompt};
Great idea! Okay, ${choice: 1}[friend/adult], you try to figure it out!${prompt};
Yippie!;
Hooray!;
Wheee!;
Haha!;
Oooh!;
Wooo!;
C'mon! It should be easy for an adult like you to understa～nd this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
And if you can't do it, then maybe we'll get the person who I heard helped Kupipi in Heavens Tower!${prompt};
We fowgot to intwoduce ourselves, didn't we? We're da Staw Onion Bwigade!${prompt};
We woam Winduwst looking fow this bad Mithwa to stop her!${prompt};
The thieving Mithwa can't hide fwom us fo' much longer, though!${prompt};
Maybe we can't read this thing-wing, but we can read restaurantaru menus all by ourselves!${prompt};
That slip of paperrr was no doubt dropped by that sneaky woman when she ran off!${prompt};
But she can't pull the wool overrr our eyes!${prompt};
Didn't Pichichi's mother make Shanruru's doll?${prompt};
It's amazing that it looks so much like the rrreal ones in the Manustery!${prompt};
You found the doll outthide the city wallth?${prompt};
It looksth as good as new. Whoever found it must've had a heart of gold.${prompt};
Thank you so much for finding my doll.${prompt};
Don't worry. I'll never let you out of my sight again!${prompt};
So? Did you fi～gure out the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Did you decipher it?;
${selection-lines};
Yup!;
No...${prompt};
Ugh. I thought you adults were supposed to be goo～d at this sort of thing.${prompt};
So let's see. “A treble for when you're in trouble.” What's a treble?${prompt};
Oh, I get it! It says that we have to find a special egg!${prompt};
Huh? It says to find a special egg?${prompt};
A special...${prompt};
Egg?;
${prompt};
I know where to get re～gular eggs. But what makes an egg special?${prompt};
Thewe are lots of kinds of eggs. Lizawd eggs, chocobo eggs...${prompt};
I want a boiled-woiled egg. Even a scrambled one would do!${prompt};
Hey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about special eggs, would you?${prompt};
Have any idea?;
${selection-lines};
Sure do.;
Not a clue.${prompt};
Hey, you're not being to～tally honest with us, are you?${prompt};
Now, now, there's no need to be rrrude. Even if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is an adult.${prompt};
Huh!? That rich man who lives in Windurst Waters!?${prompt};
And he wants to make a tra～de with the Yagudo?${prompt};
The Yagudo? Oh no! What if they eat-weat us!?${prompt};
How frightful!${prompt};
My mom always says that if you deal with a Yagudo, they'll capturrre you and you'll never make it back!${prompt};
Oh dearrr...${prompt};
The wich man in Winduwst Watews... I think his name is Honoi-Gomoi.${prompt};
His gweat-gweat-gweat-gwandfatha' was a powerful mage, so that's why he's so wich!${prompt};
But I heard that Honoi-Gomoi ith a very bad man.${prompt};
Really, Pichichi?${prompt};
If we go way, way, way, way, way, way back, he'th related to a very bad perthon.${prompt};
Are you...sure?${prompt};
It'th very confuthing, but it'th the truth.;
My mom told me tho.${prompt};
Well, if your mom said it, it mu～st be true!${prompt};
What is Honoi-Gomoi up to?${prompt};
Even though we've signed a peace tweaty with the Yagudo, only the people at the Whinostery have any contact with them.${prompt};
Maybe Honoi-Gomoi doeth too! He'th a bad perthon!${prompt};
And he's the one who said to break down Joker!${prompt};
If we go way, way, way, way, way, way back, he'th related to a very bad perthon.${prompt};
I bet it's related to the who～le incident with Joker!${prompt};
My mom thaid that he'th definitely involved in thome thinithter plots.${prompt};
Well, if your mom said it, it mu～st be true!${prompt};
We've got to stop him before it's too late!${prompt};
Who's with me?;
${selection-lines};
I am!!!;
...${prompt};
Woo hoo!;
Hooray!;
Yes!;
Yeah!;
Wheee!;
Fantastic!;
Oookay! Now, where do we begi～n?${prompt};
If that letter is true, then we've got to get that spe～cial egg, right?${prompt};
Yes. Definitely beforrre Honoi-Gomoi does.${prompt};
I remember hearrring something about special legendary eggs when I was living in the western lands.${prompt};
They said that they are incredibly brilliantly patterned eggs that brrring unimaginable good luck to the bearer.${prompt};
Hey! My dad has a really beautiful pot that sound-wounds just like your egg!${prompt};
What's that got to do with anything?${prompt};
Wait...could it be...${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt};
That's it! That's what they're called!${prompt};
Then we'll jutht have to find a perfect ${item-singular: 1[2]} and we'll all be happy!${prompt};
Uh, Pichichi? What're you on about?${prompt};
My mom thaid it's the rarest of all ${item-plural: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Don't you think that it'th at leatht worth a shot to bring us good luck? We can get one right near the Boyahda Tree!${prompt};
We'we not twying to get good luck, we'we twying to get in Honoi-Gomoi's way!${prompt};
It's not the best plan, but it might be good enough!${prompt};
We can interrupt their meeting and...hey, where was the meeting anyway?${prompt};
Leave it to the master spy!${prompt};
It might be too da～ngerous by yourself, so we should all go!${prompt};
Not alone! We should a～ll go!${prompt};
While we're doing that, you should go find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
You know where the Boyahda Tree is, right? Good lu～ck!${prompt};
Okay! Now we've got to find out where the mee～ting will take place!${prompt};
While we do that, you go to the Boyahda Tree and find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}!${prompt};
How awe we supposed to find the meeting place? Do we just sneak into his mansion?${prompt};
That's like stealing! And stealing is vewy, vewy bad.${prompt};
I'll head to the restaurantaru and see if I can't sniff out any clues!${prompt};
Hey, why are you still here? Shouldn't you be searrrching for ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}?${prompt};
You can rrrelax once the job's done. Just make sure it doesn't crack!${prompt};
Wherever the meeting will take place, it's prrrobably not here in Windurst.${prompt};
I'll devise a way to sneak us out of the city unnoticed!${prompt};
My mom thaid that ${keyitem-plural: 2[2]} are the raretht kind of ${item-plural: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I bet you can find one near the Boyahda Tree!${prompt};
I may not look like much, but I'm a really good spy!${prompt};
I won't be left here to rot while everyone else goes out and has all the fun!${prompt};
So this...is ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}?${prompt};
It certainly does have a very stri～king design.${prompt};
Now to intrude upon the meeting!${prompt};
But fiwst, an explanation. We managed to captuwe the Mithwa thief!${prompt};
And what's mowe, we discovewed a bunch about that secwet meeting. Honoi-Gomoi is going to trade the legendawy egg for the magic doll.${prompt};
And of couwse, we know the location in which the exchange is going to take place...${prompt};
But Shanruru got caught again.${prompt};
The thieving Mithrrra let her go, however.${prompt};
She was so scarrred when we told her that we had a strong adventurer friend coming for her!${prompt};
But she thaid thomething weird, too.${prompt};
Your name is ${name-player}, right?${prompt};
I kind of like that name.${prompt};
The thief said that you can sto～p the exchange from taking place.${prompt};
I don't think she liketh the Yagudo either.${prompt};
She also apologized for not treating my doll better.${prompt};
And she gave us a little something in apology...and we'll share it with you.${prompt};
My doll says “Thank you” too!${prompt};
Take good care of it!;
Look who it is!${prompt};
Don't forget to take Shanruru's gift of thanks!${prompt};
Oh, right. You want to know where the rich fuddy-duddy and the Yagudo are mee～ting.${prompt};
Behind a magic tower in West Sarutabaruta!${prompt};
As soon as everyone's rea～dy, we're off to punish the evildoer!${prompt};
Oh, and we'll get Joker to come-wome along with us!${prompt};
We can't. His body is too big to leave thwough the secret passage.${prompt};
Hmph. Maybe next time!${prompt};
Ghosty, pwease keep us safe, okay?${prompt};
Shanruru, you can ho～ld down the fort while we're gone, right?${prompt};
Hey!!! That's not fair!${prompt};
You're always such a slowpoke.${prompt};
Here's my plan. We stay as far back as we can and show the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt};
And when the Yagudo after the egg comes, we sca～tter and run away.${prompt};
But if we've got too many slo～wpokes, the plan goes poof!${prompt};
And if you get caught, the Yagudo might eat you!${prompt};
B-but...it's dangerous for everyone, not just me!${prompt};
Well, I guess you're ri～ght, but still...${prompt};
That's why the thief said to leave it to our adventurer friend!${prompt};
<Sigh> That's supposed to be a secret-wecret.${prompt};
It's way too dangewous to leave to adults!${prompt};
But if it's so dangerous, maybe we should listen to her.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Let me handle this!;
It should be okay.${prompt};
No way! We can take ca～re of ourselves just fine!${prompt};
After all, we're the Star Onion Brigade, and we stand for justice!${prompt};
That's right. And you'll be with us, so there'll be no pro～blem!${prompt};
And with justice on our side, we're invi～ncible!${prompt};
Yay!;
Woo hoo!;
Yes!;
Yippie!;
Hooray!;
Huh!?;
Fine. ${choice: 2}[Joker and I will/I'll] wait here.${prompt};
We'll go as soon as you're ready!${prompt};
We'll go hide near the magic to～wer in West Sarutabaruta. Remember, the meeting is going to take place behind it!${prompt};
We'll go hide near the magic to～wer in West Sarutabaruta. Remember, the meeting is going to take place behind it!${prompt};
I'll take good care of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} that the Yagudo are so eager to get their hands on.${prompt};
I've got the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} wight here with me.${prompt};
I wondew what Honoi-Gomoi is planning to do.${prompt};
We've got to be ready for a fight-wight!${prompt};
I'm the fastest of everyone in the Starrr Onion Brigade.${prompt};
I'll be a decoy to attract their attention so that my slower friends can escape!${prompt};
Don't tell my mom about our plans. She worrries too much.${prompt};
Adults are always saying that we can't do this, or have to do that. It's really annoying!${prompt};
Why do the Yagudo want the egg tho much?${prompt};
Wait. Why doeth Honoi-Gomoi want to trade with the Yagudo?${prompt};
Is everyone reaaally sure that this'll go according to plan?${prompt};
I guess I'll be here while you're out in the field, so keep an eye on everyone for me!${prompt};
I-I wasn't scared at all! Honest!${prompt};
Okay. Once more, for ju～stice!${prompt};
I was weally wowwied that we'd get caught! Okay, we have to be bwave!${prompt};
Sometimes fleeing is the better-wetter part of valor!${prompt};
I'm fasterrr than everyone else!${prompt};
Maybe I need a breather beforrre going back.${prompt};
Everyone's here, right? We didn't lose anyone?${prompt};
But we still have to finish what we started...${prompt};
Are we done playing tag?${prompt};
Is everyone going to be okay?${prompt};
Remember, you've got to look after everyone while I stay behind!${prompt};
Phew! That was qui～te the adventure!${prompt};
We were attacked by bodyguards, and Pichichi nearly got taken!${prompt};
I'm glad that you all made it back safely...even if I did miss all the fun.${prompt};
The egg may have broken, but it therved ith purpothe!${prompt};
Although we didn't quite cawwy out our goal of stopping the exchange...${prompt};
We did get the doll!${prompt};
I wish the doll came with a pastry-wastry of some sort...${prompt};
But if Pichichi is right, then it's a very evil doll.${prompt};
Ta-da! Here ith the evil doll right here!${prompt};
Chaos...${prompt};
Chaos? Maybe that's the name of a pastry!${prompt};
Is “Chaos” a type of pastry?${prompt};
Maybe an adult would know! What kind of pastwy is Chaos?${prompt};
Have you ever eaten Chaos?;
${selection-lines};
Om nom.;
No...${prompt};
<Sputter>...;
Oh no! The doll broke!${prompt};
It'th not moving anymore.${prompt};
Hmmm. Ma～ybe we just need to feed it some Chaos!${prompt};
Should you feed it Chaos?;
${selection-lines};
Sure. What could go wrong?;
I don't even know where to start.${prompt};
Maybe you should hold on to thith for a while.${prompt};
You're gonna give it up? Just like that!?${prompt};Je suppose que nous pourrions vous le confier. Qu'en pensez-vous, tout le monde?${prompt}
If it'th a bad doll, then it thould go back to ith rightful plathe.${prompt};Vous ne voulez pas!?${prompt}
Its ri～ghtful place? Do you know where that is?${prompt};Je parie qu'il devrait aller au Manustère!${prompt}
Do you?;Oui, si c'est une poupée maléfique, alors je parie que le Professeur Korru-Moru saurait quoi en faire!${prompt}
${selection-lines};Attendez... ça sent comme... la Tour des Cieux...${prompt}
Sure do.;Je suis sûre qu'un adulte peut s'en sortir!${prompt}
Nope.${prompt};Eh bien, ce que dit Pichichi, va. Qu'en dites-vous, tout le monde?${prompt}
I guess we could entrust it to you. What do you think, everyone?${prompt};Hourra!
You don't!?${prompt};Youpi!
I bet it should go to the Manustery!${prompt};Hourra!
Yeah, if it's an evil doll, then I bet Professor Korrru-Moru would know what to do with it!${prompt};Oui!
Wait...it smells like...Heavens Towerrr...${prompt};Hourra!
I'm thure an adult can figure it out!${prompt};Hourra!
Well, what Pichichi says, goes. What do you say, everyone?${prompt};Alors c'est décidé! Vous devez le ramener là où il appartient!${prompt}
Hooray!;Et quand vous le ferez, ne laissez pas les adultes malveillants s'en tirer à bon compte!${prompt}
Yippie!;Pichichi adorerait que vous rameniez la poupée maléfique là où elle appartient.${prompt}
Woo hoo!;Bien sûr, je ne sais pas où cela pourrait être - mais vous êtes un adulte, alors vous pouvez comprendre!${prompt}
Yeah!;Vous devez être très prudent autour de cette poupée. Je pense qu'il n'y a que de mauvaises choses à venir.${prompt}
Yay!;Je ne m'attendrais pas à ce que Honoi-Gomoi reste sans rien faire. Nous devons tous être très prudents.${prompt}
Wooo!;Ouf. Maintenant que c'est fait, organisons un grand dîner et ensuite un bon repos!${prompt}
Then it's deci～ded! You've got to take it back to where it belongs!${prompt};Nous nous sommes débarrassés des méchants et nous devons célébrer!${prompt}
And when you do, don't let the bad adults get away with anything!${prompt};Je suis vraiment excité par la façon dont tout s'est déroulé, même si c'était un peu ennuyeux sur le moment.${prompt}
Pichichi would just lo～ve it if you returned the evil doll to where it belongs.${prompt};Je dois continuer à m'entraîner jusqu'à ce que je sois plus rapide que l'éclair!${prompt}
Of course, I don't know where that would be--but you're an adult, so you can figure it out!${prompt};Eh bien, puisque nous n'avons pas vu de Yagudo, il pourrait être sûr de partager mes aventures avec ma mère.${prompt}
You have to be vewy caweful around that doll. I think thewe awe only bad things ahead.${prompt};Mais vous savez à quel point les adultes peuvent parfois se mettre en colère!${prompt}
I wouldn't expect Honoi-Gomoi to take it lying down. We've all got to be vewy careful.${prompt};La poupée a parlé avec une voix vraiment basse et effrayante...${prompt}
Phew. Now that that's done, let's have a big dinner-winner and then a nice rest!${prompt};J'aimerais que ma poupée soit aussi cool!${prompt}
We've gotten rid of the bad guys and need to celebrate!${prompt};Pouvez-vous imaginer avoir deux poupées au lieu d'une? Quel amusement!${prompt}
