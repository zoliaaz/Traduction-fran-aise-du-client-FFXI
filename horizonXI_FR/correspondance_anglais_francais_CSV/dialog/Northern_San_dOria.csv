No.${prompt};
You accept the mission.${prompt};
What do you want with this gatehouse?${prompt};
Your business?;
${selection-lines};
A mission, please.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Hmm...not much work for those wet behind the ears, but...${prompt};
How about slaying Orcish scouts? Only the yellowest of yearlings would run from that, and we've no work for cowards here.${prompt};
If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.${prompt};
Interested?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Never mind.${prompt};
"Here's your mission. Orcish scouts roam outside; kill one and bring me his axe as proof.${prompt}";
You'll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. No other kind will do. Understand?${prompt};
That is all. You'll take the mission then?${prompt};
Do you accept the mission?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
Could you explain again?;
No, thank you.${prompt};
"Bring me one of those axes, and your mission will be a success. No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}";
Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt};
That's another ${item-singular: 0[2]} for the armory, then. Mission complete! Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt};
What? I don't want this!${prompt};
Are you really a new recruit!?${prompt};
Listen, before you bring me something, you must first accept the mission! That is how things work around here!${prompt};
Persistent, aren't you? An Orc under the belt does not a hero make! Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt};
Bat patrol! How about it? Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself, no?${prompt};
Here's your mission, then. Clear out bats lurking in King Ranperre's Tomb and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt};
Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and your mission will be a success.${prompt};
"Deep in the tomb you'll find Goblins. Take care; I don't want to lose you yet.${prompt}";
Ah, you've returned! I was afraid that Goblins got you.${prompt};
That's one ${item-singular: 3[2]} for the gatehouse, then. Mission complete. Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt};
Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt};
Well, perhaps you can be of some help. Many of our children have disappeared mysteriously, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt};
The Royal Knights should be on the job by now, but the two princes are at each other's throats.${prompt};
Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt};
While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt};
They've been arguing this back and forth for days. The knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt};
If you really want to make a name for yourself, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt};
What say you? Will you go?${prompt};
Here's your mission, then. Rescue the two children kidnapped by the Orcs of Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt};
Ghelsba Outpost is northwest of West Ronfaure. Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the entrance up in the hills.${prompt};
If you have trouble finding the way, just follow one of the soldiers on patrol.${prompt};
Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check them first.${prompt};
Ah, you've returned! You were gone so long, I feared a warmachine had got you!${prompt};
At any rate, mission complete! And to reward your accomplishment...${prompt};
I hereby recognize you, ${name-player}, as a certified adventurer of San d'Oria! You're now mission rank two, as well.${prompt};
But don't get too excited. Your title is valid only here in San d'Oria, understand?${prompt};
In order to become a true adventurer, and bear ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you must be recognized by Bastok and Windurst as well.${prompt};
'Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law. I know it's hard, but those are the rules.${prompt};
For now, cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt};
You achieve rank 2!${prompt};
There's not much work in right now. I suppose you could go participate in the Temple Knights' rescue drills out on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt};
Enter the forest beyond the Westgate and head southwest. You'll come out onto the La Theine Plateau before long.${prompt};
Once you're out on the plateau, keep going until you see the knights. The training grounds aren't far from there.${prompt};
It's all just a drill, so this should be easy compared to your usual fare. Just follow orders and you'll be fine.${prompt};
You've returned! I hear the drill turned into something far more perilous. But real battle is the best drill for recruits, in my opinion.${prompt};
Regardless, you've done well. I'll turn to you when there's work to be done, now.${prompt};
Here, take this ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Go ahead, you've earned it.${prompt};
This time it's messenger duty. One of our knights is out scouting in a place called Davoi, on the southern edge of Jugner Forest.${prompt};
The Orcs' stronghold is in Davoi, so it's vital that we stop them from massing, or they may launch an assault.${prompt};
Of course, the Orcs are keeping an eye on us, too. Why, just a few days past, a squad of our Royal Knights fell to their axes.${prompt};
We have sent scouts to find a weakness in their defenses. You must find the scout there now, and bring back the latest scouting report.${prompt};
The scout's name is Zantaviat. He's somewhere in Davoi, but where I cannot say.${prompt};
Come back after you've gotten the report. Those lands are no place to wander.${prompt};
You have returned! And you've brought the scouting report. Good work, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Troubling news, this is. It says that Orcs are gathering deep inside the encampment. The time to act is coming!${prompt};
But that is not your concern. You've done well today. Mission complete!${prompt};
Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. And at just the right time, too. Monarlais Halver is looking for an adventurer such as yourself.${prompt};
"Enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver is there; he'll explain in person.${prompt}";
What? You haven't been certified in Bastok and Windurst yet? You may dally, but others are not! Get moving!${prompt};
Ah, welcome back. I see you've been certified in Bastok and Windurst. Good work. You'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt};
What's that, a report for our kingdom? I see. Take that to the monarlais when you go.${prompt};
You should receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Monarlais Halver. Now, go to Chateau d'Oraguille and let them know you're back!${prompt};
Hurry to Chateau d'Oraguille and give that report to Monarlais Halver!${prompt};
You achieve rank 3!${prompt};
Ah! You've come at just the right time. Zantaviat, one of our scouts in Davoi, needs an adventurer.${prompt};
He wants someone to infiltrate Davoi and scout behind enemy lines. Know anyone fitting that description?${prompt};
Now that you've got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, this is an opportunity to prove you're worth it!${prompt};
The situation in Davoi worsens by the day. This won't be easy, but I can't think of a better adventurer for the job!${prompt};
You've returned! Zantaviat told me everything. Congratulations on a job well done!${prompt};
But we can't let down our guard yet. Those Orcs will not just sit there. We must keep constant vigil, and move before they do!${prompt};
Here's your reward: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You're becoming quite the adventurer, aren't you?${prompt};
Welcome back! I have an important mission for you this time. Recently, land is eroding due to crystal formation...and it's getting worse.${prompt};
There's a small spring on the eastern edge of Jugner Forest, called Crystwater Spring. We must know what effect crystal formation has on the wildlife there.${prompt};
I want you to get me a fish from the spring. And not just any fish! You need to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, that reminds me--have you any fishing gear? You'll need some for this mission.${prompt};
There are people about that know a thing or two about fishing, should you need help finding and choosing your gear.${prompt};
Ah, the great angler returns! I was worried, to be honest. All you hear these days is the massing of beasts, the erosion of the Crystal Lines, and now...${prompt};
...rumors that the Shadow Lord himself has returned!${prompt};
We will examine the fish you brought. Depending on the results, we may need to act! I'll let you know if we need your help.${prompt};
Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. You've come at a good time. I've news for you.${prompt};
By order of the Kingdom of San d'Oria, you're to head to Jeuno as an ambassadorial attaché.${prompt};
Go to Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver will tell you all you need to know.${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
There you are! I've been looking for you. Monarlais Halver requests your presence at the chateau immediately.${prompt};
It sounds as if this is a fairly important mission. I need not remind you that you should take care to properly equip yourself before embarking on this journey.${prompt};
I'm not sure what it's about, but you'd best make haste. The monarlais is not to be kept waiting!${prompt};
Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! This is no time for loafing around, friend! Prince Trion is looking for you.${prompt};
For this next mission, he's requested you personally. You should be honored!${prompt};
As for the details of the mission, I've no idea what he wants, but he was in a hurry. You'd best be off to Chateau d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It is a great thing you've done, ${name-player}! I knew deep in my heart that you were the one for the task.${prompt};
You'd better get to the chateau quick. They're all waiting to welcome you back, I'd wager.${prompt};
You've saved our proud Kingdom of San d'Oria. No, you're the savior of all Vana'diel! There's not a soul that doesn't owe you a great debt, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
You had best hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille. It seems as if something terrible is in the works there.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!;
Your timing is perfect. The chateau just sent a request for an adventurer.${prompt};
It looks as if this next mission has something to do with the late queen. You should feel honored. It's not every day that an adventurer gets to work directly with the royal family.${prompt};
Spoken like a true San d'Orian!;
Now hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille and get the details on the mission from Monarlais Halver.${prompt};
What's wrong? Dealing with royalty is not your cup of tea? Well, think about it and come back when you've come to your senses.${prompt};
Prince Trion is requesting the aid of an adventurer. How about it?${prompt};
It looks fairly urgent, so you should hurry to the chateau. The prince is waiting in his chambers.${prompt};
I expected more from you, ${name-player}. If you change your mind, return here. I'll be waiting.${prompt};
I have received the details of your mission from Prince Trion. I will deliver this book to the scholars for deciphering.${prompt};
The deciphering of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will take a considerable amount of time. Return later for a report.${prompt};
You handed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over to the guard.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. We've been waiting.;
Prince Trion is calling for you. I wonder if this means the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been completely deciphered.${prompt};
Well done, ${name-player}! I knew you would not let the Kingdom down.${prompt};
I'm proud to increase your rank to 7!${prompt};
The papsque has work for you, ${name-player}. Are you willing to take on the task?${prompt};
Excellent. Proceed to the papsque's chambers on the third floor of the cathedral.${prompt};
The papsque often comes across as a difficult man, but he is actually very kindhearted and compassionate. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.${prompt};
The fair Claidie I d'Oraguille has invited you to the chateau. She wishes for you to see the flowers that have bloomed from the seeds you brought back from Altepa.${prompt};
It is an honor to be invited to the chateau garden. One day you may even have the opportunity to attend one of their royal garden parties.${prompt};
We cannot keep the princess waiting. Now, off to the chateau!${prompt};
A party of Royal Knights stationed in Ghelsba Outpost have reported strange activity by Orcs deep within Yughott Grotto.${prompt};
From your reports, we already know that the beastmen have built a giant portal, but their motives remain unclear.${prompt};
It makes me shudder to think of what those Orcs are planning with that portal...${prompt};
${name-player}, your next mission is to travel to Ghelsba and continue your investigation into the Orcs' activities.${prompt};
Be on your guard when traveling deep into Yughott Grotto. Losing an adventurer such as yourself would deal a great blow to all of San d'Oria.${prompt};
I see you need more time for preparations. When you are ready, I'll be waiting.${prompt};
It's hard to believe Orcs have their hands on such dangerous equipment. More patrols will have to be sent out to prevent any new developments in their evil plans.${prompt};
And this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... We will have to analyze it and begin reproduction for our forces. We cannot let Orcs get the Treasure of the Dragon King before San d'Oria does.${prompt};
Well, congratulations on the completion of your mission. Hmmm? Do I know of an adventurer named Eideialc? Never heard of him.${prompt};
But you need not worry about some petty traveler. You are in a different league. You are now rank 8!${prompt};
Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. This ceremony is an important facet of d'Oraguille tradition.${prompt};
Monarlais Halver has put out a call to high-ranking adventurers for their assistance in Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
Ah, the young princess has finally become a lady... Oh, I'm sorry. You can get the details of your next mission from Sir Halver.${prompt};
What? You do not wish to repay the kindness the princess has shown to you in the past months? As you wish...but if you change your mind, you know where to find me.${prompt};
I am busy with preparations for Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony. You don't know what kind of vermin could be roaming the streets and looking for trouble.${prompt};
Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is about to begin at the cathedral. I must remain at my post, but why don't you attend?${prompt};
The king has requested your audience. He has selected you from the mountain of adventurers in San d'Oria. You should feel honored!${prompt};
You have matured from a fledgling adventurer into a great asset to our kingdom. Do not let us down.${prompt};
There is no need for modesty at a time like this. The fate of San d'Oria is at stake!${prompt};
The authorities are saying that a dark cloud of despair is looming over the Kingdom. They are asking for the assistance of only the best adventurers.${prompt};
I can think of none more qualified than you. Will you accept this mission?${prompt};
Then proceed to the Audience Chamber in the Chateau d'Oraguille.;
Word has it that His Highness is not feeling that well. He may not be present for your briefing.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! The Kingdom is counting on you. Who else, I ask you, is worthy for this task?${prompt};
Ah, a time of great change is upon us. In a matter of days, the Rites of Succession will be held at the cathedral in Northern San d'Oria. It is then that the new heir to the throne will be decided.${prompt};
Due to the unpredictable circumstances that took place at the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, this time, only authorized personnel will be allowed near the proceedings. However, the royal family has requested your services as a guard.${prompt};
Even we Royal Knights have not been granted permission to attend... You must be held in high regard by His Highness. I envy you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am].${prompt};
When you have finished your preparations, proceed directly to the cathedral to report.${prompt};
Off the record, which of the two princes do you think should be the next heir to the throne?${prompt};
It is a difficult decision, but...;
${selection-lines};
Trion is better suited.;
Pieuje is better suited.${prompt};
Hm...;
Being the oldest, he is the true heir, and many people believe he is the most suited to rule the Kingdom. However, Prince Pieuje's prudent ways may be what this country is lacking.${prompt};
Many think as you do, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. However, what this country may need is someone who will not back down in the face of a threat--someone who will stand up for the pride of the Kingdom.${prompt};
But our opinion is of no matter. Lightbringer will decide who is the most suited to stand over our fine nation. And do not speak a word of today's exchange, for the monarlais will have our heads if he finds out.${prompt};
I realize that you must have many preparations before taking on such an important mission. Take your time and return here when you are ready.${prompt};

(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

I found ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

Master, Master!;
I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};
Master! What ${choice: 7}[an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there!;
Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...${prompt};
We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!${prompt};
Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo?;
Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!${prompt};
We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo!;
If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Look at what I found while cleaning out the ${item-singular: 3[2]}: ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
ボタン押すと次へ進みます${prompt};
It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;
Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!${prompt};

Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].;
I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.${prompt};
However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.${prompt};
I see that you currently have a trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.${prompt};
You do have the option to terminate your contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.;
Create a new contract with us?;
${selection-lines};
Immediately.;
Not today.${prompt};
Are you certain?;
${selection-lines};
I said, “Immediately.”;
On second thought...${prompt};
You have terminated your trading contract with the ${choice: 1}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};
Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.${prompt};
If you happen to create a ${color: 5}high quality${color: 1} version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.${prompt};
Trading us these items will earn you “guild points” which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.${prompt};
The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.${prompt};
When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.${prompt};
I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.${prompt};
If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.${prompt};
You have formed a new trading contract with the ${choice: 0}[Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.${prompt};

Now, what business would an adventurer have in the Carpenters' Guild?;
This is a union for woodworkers, masons, and the like.${prompt};
Then I'm going to have to ask you to leave. We pride ourselves in “safety first” here, and we don't want any visitors getting hurt, now.${prompt};
Well, you look like a strong one. And who knows? Maybe you'll catch on quick. Just to play it safe, we'll start you off with crystal synthesis.${prompt};
You're probably in a hurry to go off and beat some beastmen, so I'll cut the small talk. That shiny rock I just gave you--that's a crystal. I'm sure an adventurer like you has seen one before.${prompt};
Extract the energy out of one of these and you can cut, plane, join...well, let's just say, do almost anything with wood.${prompt};
I'm no scientist, so don't go asking me the details. As long as it works, we'll keep using 'em...but only on rush jobs. A good old hammer and some nails--that's where true carpentry starts.${prompt};
If you need any help starting out, ask the workers inside the guild.;
I evaluate my students on their abilities, and nothing else. You work hard, you'll move up in this trade.${prompt};
Hardness, elasticity, weight...wood has too many merits to be able to say for certain which is best.${prompt};
Wood is the body and soul of a tree. Listen to what the soul has to say and let those words live on in your works. Only then will you become a true carpenter.${prompt};
From the looks of you, it seems that you're ready for the next step.;
Make me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
If you pass my test, I'll teach you some new techniques.${prompt};
...;
Fairly nice work. I give you the title of ${choice: 7}[amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice].;
Work hard and never forget to be a good example to the younger students.${prompt};
...;
I see that your skills become more refined with each day. I present you with the title of journeyman.;
You make an excellent example for the other students.${prompt};
...;
Remarkable! Your work is nearly flawless! Starting today, consider yourself an artisan.;
There isn't a member of this guild who doesn't know of your work.${prompt};
Unbelievable. I've never seen such a...such a work of art!;
You are the pride of the Carpenters' Guild and worthy of the title of adept.${prompt};
It's as if Altana made this herself. It's nothing less than a blessing from heaven. I am proud to work alongside a veteran of your caliber.${prompt};
If I have told them once, I have told them a thousand times--if we do not start on the new weaponry, our forces will be no match for those fiendish Orcs...;
Oh, who might you be?${prompt};
Pardon me, but I have done all I can do for you at the moment.${prompt};
How pitiful--being unable to afford the wealth of knowledge I have to offer.${prompt};
I shall help you. However, if you happen to falter, blame only yourself.${prompt};
For an adventurer such as you, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} should be manageable.;
You will require...${prompt};
That is all.;
I am in the middle of an extremely important project. If you have finished with your business here, I request your departure.${prompt};
<Sigh>... When is tha' guildmaster of ours gonna stand up tae old Ulycille?${prompt};
Hey, somebody has already 'elped ye!${prompt};
Where's the rest? Lass week, Ah 'elped this lassie for free and got quite a smack upside me head from the guildmaster. Don't want that tae be happenin' anymore now do we?${prompt};
There we are. Now close yer eyes...${prompt};
An adventurer like ye would be best off wit' ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
Ah make it wit these...${prompt};
If ye want tae make somethin' fancy, ask Ulycille.;
Anything else, ask me. But bide away from Ramua. She makes too mannae mistakes.${prompt};
Hello!;
Sorry, but I am busy at the moment!;
Good day!${prompt};
I am sorry, but I cannot help you at the moment!${prompt};
I am sorry, but this is not enough...and my services are the most inexpensive here.${prompt};
Do not worry! I know what I am doing! Now please close your eyes...${prompt};
Yes. Why not try ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
It requires...${prompt};
I heard that if you travel to the forest on a chocobo, you are likely to find good timber...but do not tell Amarefice I told you his secret.${prompt};
Your skills as a carpenter impress me and the others of the guild. Build for me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
If you are able to complete this task, I will grant you the title of craftsman and you will become a true member of this guild.${prompt};
However, while I find it impossible to think that you would do such a thing, I warn you that there could be consequences from earning this title in more than one guild.${prompt};
Becoming a craftsman in any guild requires a high level of skill and concentration. But there is only so much that people like us can fit into our heads. Remember that.${prompt};
Excellent work! I knew that you could do it!;
I hereby grant you the title of craftsman. You are ready to accept the responsibility that comes with that name.${prompt};
There is no need to rush your work. Continue slowly along your path and you will not fail. Just remember to never stray too far from the road.${prompt};

Like I told you before, becoming a craftsman in any guild requires a high level of skill and concentration. But there is only so much that people like us can fit into our heads.${prompt};
And that is why I am going to give you a choice: revoke your craftsman status at all other guilds, or forget about your dreams of being a master woodworker.${prompt};
Revoke all other craftsman statuses?;
${selection-lines};
I'm ready.;
Not on your life.${prompt};
I knew you would make the right decision.;
Oh, and do not worry about informing the other guildmasters. I will send a notice of your intentions right away.${prompt};
And I thought you were different from those other adventurers...;
I guess I will have to find someone else to eventually take my position as guildmaster...${prompt};
The synthesis items for that rank are still beyond your skill, I'm afraid.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a wonderful new method of woodworking that allows you to bundle lumber together, making it easier to process more bolts with one crystal.${prompt};
If you think that as ${choice: 0}[a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] you've learned all there is to know about carpentry, think again!;
There is magic that can be worked with hammer and nail that would blow your mind into sawdust. Would you know more?${prompt};
Strive for more?;
${selection-lines};
Sign me up!;
Another time, perhaps.${prompt};
Spoken like a true carpenter!;
First, you'll want to speak to Andreas and--assuming he's not too busy carving one of his famed wooden pheasants--obtain from him a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Mind you, you'll have to hammer yourself out a few guild points if you don't have some in stock already.${prompt};
And so the carpenter's hammer proves too weighty for yet another.;
Fear not, I shall be waiting here should you decide to heft it once more.${prompt};
Have you not spoken with Andreas as instructed? Or was he too occupied with his pheasant-carving to give you a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Back so soon?;
Haha! I knew that devouring the contents of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} would be as easy for you as sawing a log.${prompt};
Your next task is to craft for me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Finding the required materials may prove a challenge in itself. You'll be needing...${prompt};
And don't forget to carve your name into your work.;
Think of it as applying the final coat of varnish to give your piece that special sheen!${prompt};
Have you been using that hammer of yours to beat your own head in?;
I just told you that making ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} requires...${prompt};
.........${wait-36: 3};
This doesn't happen often, ${name-player}, but your peerless craftsmanship has left me at a loss for words.;
Let it suffice to say that you have earned the title of expert, and then some.${prompt};
While I cannot fault the craftsmanship, neither can I credit you for a work that doesn't bear your signature.${prompt};
Rules are rules, and I cannot--I will not--make exceptions even for one of your talents.${prompt};
Your skills as a carpenter impress me and the others of the guild. Build for me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
If you are able to complete this task, I will grant you the title of ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] and you will become a true member of this guild.${prompt};
However, while I find it impossible to think that you would do such a thing, I warn you that there could be consequences from earning this title in more than one guild.${prompt};
Becoming ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in any guild requires a high level of skill and concentration. But there is only so much that people like us can fit into our heads. Remember that.${prompt};
Mind you, becoming ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in any guild requires a high level of skill and concentration. You would do well to remember that there is only so much knowledge we can fit in our heads.${prompt};
So you went and became ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran] at another guild... And this after I told you that it was not a wise idea. What were you thinking?${prompt};
Like I told you before, achieving such a rank in any guild requires a high level of skill and concentration. But there is only so much that people like us can fit into our heads.${prompt};
And that is why I am going to give you a choice: revoke your ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] status at these other guilds, or forget about your dreams of being a master woodworker.${prompt};
Do not worry about informing the other guildmasters. I will send a notice of your intentions right away.${prompt};
Never did I think I would hear you say those words, ${name-player}.;
You disappoint me gravely.${prompt};
And yet, let it not be said that we carpenters hold grudges.;
Should you decide to return to the path of the hammer and nail, our doors will be open for you.${prompt};
This is the Blacksmiths' Guild, where skilled weapon and armorsmiths gather. Without us, a proud knight is but a paper tiger. Well, what is it, then?${prompt};
Aha! A Bastok spy, are you? Many secrets we hold dear, and pigs will fly before I surrender them!${prompt};
Bah, another adventurer... Devotion to our craft is in short supply of late. Here!${prompt};
"I'm sure you know, but that is a crystal, filled with incredible energy. No, not like blood; it is more akin to a block of coal.${prompt}";
You can synthesize crystals to make all sorts of things. Focus your will upon it, bring forth the heat, and transform the materials.${prompt};
"But not me! I'm not fond of using them; they're costly, and the process finishes too quickly. Yes, toil is what makes things dear!${prompt}";
Go and ask the others what materials to use. And, though it pains me to say it, you may learn much about smithing by visiting Bastok.${prompt};
You still have much to learn. Even our newest apprentices are a step ahead of you.${prompt};
You think you've reached the top? Your head is still in the clouds, young adventurer. Even I am still climbing...${prompt};
I believe you are ready to move on to the next rank. Craft me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Finish a quality piece, and I will teach you more.${prompt};
Hmm... Well, not bad. I shall promote you to the rank of ${choice: 7}[amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice]. Do not rest, for the road ahead is long.${prompt};
Yes... This will do. I hereby award you the rank of journeyman. Congratulations. We have high hopes for you.${prompt};
Why, bless my bellows! A work of art, indeed! You shall henceforth be addressed as artisan. May you live up to that name.${prompt};
Unbelievable that a mere adventurer like you could forge such fine steel. Reminds me of when I was your age...${prompt};
I...I'm at a loss for words. You've more than proven yourself as a veteran of the Blacksmiths' Guild! Why, you're almost as good as I was when I was your age...almost.${prompt};
Can't you see I'm busy? We are up to our ears in work these days!${prompt};
No, you should try it on your own.${prompt};
Oh, I'm sorry. The guildmaster is displeased when we give help for free. “A friend is but a competitor,” he likes to say.${prompt};
All right. Close your eyes, and focus on the craft.${prompt};
Hmm... Well, I'd recommend someone of your skill to try crafting ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Here's what you'll need:${prompt};
Did you get that? Remember, our guildmaster is strict, but behind his grim face lies joy at seeing new apprentices. Come back any time, friend!${prompt};
Clang-clong! All the day long!♪;
We work by the forge and pound blades strong!♪${prompt};
Why, hello! You look awfully weary!${prompt};
Money makes the world go round. Yes, it does!♪${prompt};
Okay! Take a deep breath and believe in yourself!${prompt};
That's right! That's right!♪;
That's what you'll need for this task!;
If you ever forget, just come back and ask!♪${prompt};
I'm busy.${prompt};
I won't help you just yet.${prompt};
Not enough gil? Well, you'll get no help from me.${prompt};
All right. Let's begin!${prompt};
Say, why don't you try crafting ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Here's what you'll need:${prompt};
That should do it. Now let me be.${prompt};
How diligently you've been working of late! Here, make me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, and I'll judge your handiwork.${prompt};
Pass this trial, and you will be recognized as a craftsman.${prompt};
But, beware! Once a craftsman, always a craftsman! Ever must you uphold the honor of this guild.${prompt};
Your knowledge of our craft is still in its infancy. Strive to further your skills, lest others trade jokes at our expense.${prompt};
Impressive! A precious piece of work, indeed! ${name-player}, I grant you the rank of craftsman. May you put your considerable talents to good use!${prompt};
You shall be taught henceforth the most treasured techniques of our craft. Your studies will require devotion, my friend, but do not overburden yourself!${prompt};

It has come to my attention that you have achieved craftsman status at another guild.${prompt};
While I admit it is always wise to broaden one's horizons, I cannot commend this choice you have made.${prompt};
If you truly wish to follow the path of the mastersmith, you must remain focused in your studies. Craftsman status in any other guilds will only poison your mind and lead you astray. However, the choice is yours...${prompt};
Revoke all other craftsman statuses?;
${selection-lines};
Immediately.;
Not just yet.${prompt};
I knew you would make the correct decision.;
Now return to your training. I shall contact the other guildmasters to inform them of your decision.${prompt};
I am quite disappointed in you, ${name-player}. I always believed you were a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of higher standards...${prompt};
Listen, I think you're reaching a bit high.;
Ask again when you're ready for that rank.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to shape softened ingots with a mandrel, making it easier to process more chains with one crystal.${prompt};

You have made admirable progress, this is true.;
But are you content to remain ${choice: 0}[a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] forever?;
There are yet greater heights to strive for, if you so desire.${prompt};
Strive for greater heights?;
${selection-lines};
Certainly!;
Maybe later...${prompt};
Excellent. I knew you were not one to rest on your laurels.;
Seek out Macuillie and obtain yourself a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
As you may surmise, this transaction will require a nominal fee in guild points.;
The duties you perform for our guild shall be the key to further advancement.${prompt};
A most unfortunate decision, given your aptitude for smithing.;
And yet perhaps it is for the best, if your heart is not truly in your work.${prompt};
Seek out Macuillie and obtain yourself a copy of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Your confident mien speaks volumes to me.;
You have reviewed the contents of ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, yes?${prompt};
Then your next task is to forge ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.;
Part of your test is acquiring the necessary materials, which are...${prompt};
And do not forget to put your name to your work.;
This is necessary to verify its authenticity, and speaks as well to the pride you take in your craft.${prompt};
<Sigh>... Your forgetfulness does not bode well for your prospects.;
Yet I suppose we all have our momentary lapses.;
The ingredients for ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} are...${prompt};
Yes...yes, indeed... You have confirmed my greatest hopes--this is truly the work of an expert.;
Stay devoted to our craft, and it will not be long until I can call you my peer.${prompt};
What is the meaning of this, ${name-player}?;
The work itself is satisfactory, but without your signature engraved, we have no way to ascertain that it is truly yours.${prompt};
Consider this a chance to outdo yourself and produce a truly transcendent piece of steel.;
Now, back to the forge with you.${prompt};
How diligently you've been working of late! Here, make me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, and I'll judge your handiwork.${prompt};
Pass this trial, and you will be recognized as ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran].${prompt};
But, beware! Once ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran], always ${choice: 5}[an artisan/an adept/a veteran]! Ever must you uphold the honor of this guild.${prompt};
Your knowledge of our craft is still in its infancy. Strive to further your skills, lest others trade jokes at our expense.${prompt};
Maintaining your level of mastery with San d'Orian smithing techniques will requires discipline and devotion.;
Now that you have reached ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] status in our guild, I would advise against delving too deeply into other crafts.${prompt};
${name-player}. Pray tell me that rumors deceive, and that you have not achieved ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] status at a guild other than our own.${prompt};
Were you a lesser smith, I might commend this decision to broaden your horizons.;
At your level of expertise, however, the time has come to devote yourself to a single path.${prompt};
What say you? Will you relinquish your ${choice: 5}[artisan/adept/veteran] status in other fields, that you might perfect your blacksmithing skills like finely tempered steel?${prompt};
You need only say the word, and I will inform any other guildmaster of your decision.;
Your mind is made up, is it not?${prompt};
Unfortunate words.;
And here I thought you were one of us, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Words cannot convey my disappointment.;
And yet, you are a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your own mind, with your own heart to follow.;
Do as you will.${prompt};
The Gates of Paradise only welcome souls free of desire. I have given my riches to the cathedral. I am now free.${prompt};
May Altana guide my soul to Paradise. My heart is calm as never before.${prompt};
Our furniture is built to last!${prompt};
Say, that ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} you've got there...${prompt};
What did you say? It was in the ${item-singular: 2[2]} you purchased...from us?${prompt};
Might I have a look? Wait, this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} looks familiar.${prompt};
Yes, as I thought! This is the mark of the royal family. This is a teacup of noble lineage!${prompt};
You must return it to its rightful owner, wherever he or she might be.${prompt};
That ${item-singular: 2[2]} you found was crafted of old. I would love to hear the history behind it.${prompt};
Few pieces of such age and quality remain.${prompt};
Shame on Calovour! Hawking such a treasure as if it were junk!${prompt};
What? The ${item-singular: 2[2]} I consigned to the furniture store? Yes, I remember it.${prompt};
Really, that was inside? I've not seen this for many years!${prompt};
I was once in the service of the late Queen Leaute. Her Highness gave it to me personally.${prompt};
Ah... Seeing this brings back many memories. I took good care of the queen and her newborn prince!${prompt};
I prayed for the royal family every time I poured ${color: 5}mistletoe${color: 1} tea into that teacup.${prompt};
Kind adventurer, I beg you. Please find me ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I would very much like to taste those memories once more.${prompt};
Please, I know it is an odd request, but it would mean so much to me.${prompt};
Kind adventurer, I beg you. Please find me ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I would very much like to taste those fond memories once more.${prompt};
Please, I know it is an odd request, but it would mean so much to me.${prompt};
As I sit, with this teacup in hand, I question whether I truly deserve Paradise.${prompt};
Queen Leaute, bless her soul, has passed away. And her two sons are forever quarreling. All I can do is pray for them both!${prompt};
Over the years, my heart has grown as dusty and dry as this old teacup.${prompt};
With this ${item-singular: 3[2]} you brought me, I will drink again from my old teacup, and reflect on what I can do for them.${prompt};
Here, please take this as a token of my gratitude. You have done me a great service!${prompt};
I tried to cast aside all desire, but in the process I lost my identity.${prompt};
I threw aside my riches to find peace, but all I found was peace for myself, alone...${prompt};
Quiet! I've no time for every fool that wants to chat.${prompt};
Quiet! Leave me alone.${prompt};
Hey, you there! You're going into the chateau to see Halver, no?${prompt};
I want you to give him this letter.${prompt};
Just give it to Halver, my friend. That's all you have to do.${prompt};
So was Halver...upset? Heh-heh-heh... I wish I could have seen it!${prompt};
It was the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for Chateau d'Oraguille! Heh-heh... Halver wouldn't give me anything for it, but the Orcs did!${prompt};
What now? You're going to take me in? Fine, but you won't get a gil for doing that.${prompt};
How about running a little errand for me instead? It could be profitable!${prompt};
Take the job?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No way.${prompt};
Heh-heh-heh... Fool of an adventurer. I pity you!${prompt};
Many youths just like you have died, crushed under the heel of this land's sinister history.${prompt};
All right. How about you go into Ghelsba, get the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I sold to those Orcs, and bring it back?${prompt};
Heh-heh... Not that I expect you to survive...${prompt};
All right. How about you go into Ghelsba, get the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I sold to those Orcs, and bring it back?${prompt};
Heh-heh... Not that I expect you to survive...${prompt};
Heh-heh... Here's your reward. Now we're partners in crime, eh?${prompt};
Next time you're around, I might have another job for you. Heh-heh...${prompt};
Next time you're around, I might have another job for you. Heh-heh...${prompt};
Heh-heh... Feel like doing a job for me again?${prompt};
Do the job?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Excellent. I want you to do the same thing, then. Bring me the ${item-singular: 1[2]} from Ghelsba. Got it?${prompt};
We have a Blacksmiths' Guild and a Carpenters' Guild here in Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
Their halls are open to the public, but do not interfere with their work.${prompt};
Did you hear the news? Someone's been going around offering to sell ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
They say the chateau's floor plans were torn into three pieces. One went to the royal family, another to the church, and the last to the guild elders.${prompt};
Hrmm... Have you heard about ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Seems the royal family and the church all think I gave up my copy of the floor plans. But I've kept mine safe, I swear it!${prompt};
Still, these rumors do have me worried. The guild elders have always kept the plans locked away. But we do not possess the key!${prompt};
Hrrm... You seem a trustworthy adventurer. Might I ask you a favor?${prompt};
There is a small island to the south of Batallia Downs, surrounded by steep cliffs. I've heard that ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} is buried there.${prompt};
I would be most grateful if you could bring me that key.${prompt};
Accept his request?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not now.${prompt};
It's on the island south of Batallia Downs. Don't ask me how to get there, for I do not know.${prompt};
What a world! I had little faith in our youth before, but now...${prompt};
The floor plans should be here, locked inside. We need that ${item-singular: 2[2]} to open it and ensure the plans are safe!${prompt};
Search for the key on the island south of Batallia Downs. I've no idea how to get there, so ask me not!${prompt};
Should the floor plans to Chateau d'Oraguille fall into enemy hands, our kingdom will be safe no more!${prompt};
I heard the plans were torn into three sheets. Should the enemy find but one of them...I fear for us all!${prompt};
I wonder if this really is the key to that old box, eh?${prompt};
Ah! It opened! And inside...?${prompt};
There it is! Our section of the plans, safe and sound. I smell a rat in the clergy...or perhaps the royal household?${prompt};
"No, forget what I just said. Here is your reward; may it serve you well in your adventures.${prompt}";
Our piece of the plans was safe. I smell a rat in the clergy...or perhaps the royal household?${prompt};
Long have the Royal Knights and the Temple Knights watched over our kingdom. They are the sword and shield of San d'Oria.${prompt};
But above all in the Kingdom of San d'Oria is the Dragon Knight. Alas, who knows what became of him?${prompt};
Nearby is a large square with a fountain: the Parade Grounds. Each country has a consulate there.${prompt};
Where are the consulates? Really, you adventurers should learn to open your main menu and select “Map” before asking directions!${prompt};
Nearby is a large square with a fountain: the Parade Grounds. Each country has a consulate there.${prompt};
You want to find the consulates? Really, you should go to Southern San d'Oria and buy a map from the lady in front the Westgate!${prompt};
Ever heard of the Brugaire Consortium? They're the largest trading company in San d'Oria, with merchants traveling as far as Jeuno.${prompt};
The vast cargo rooms down at the port belong to them, you know.${prompt};
My big brother, he's a Royal Knight. He's off fighting Orcs, far, far away from here.${prompt};
It's so lonely without him. But someday I'll be a Royal Knight, too, fighting by his side!${prompt};
Always take care of your sword, the body that wields it, and the spirit that guides them!${prompt};
Whether you lose your sword or lose your arm, never quit while you still have fight left in you!${prompt};
You've been to the cathedral, have you not? Did you not find it magnificent?${prompt};
All things are touched by the light of judgment. Ah, but it is hard to express faith in something so crude as words.${prompt};
Only the honorable may serve San d'Oria in all her glory. We don't need vagabonds watering down our ranks.${prompt};
Finish your business, and get out of our city!${prompt};
It's been twenty years since my son joined the Temple Knights... And still Ronfaure is thick with Orcs!${prompt};
It's all the fault of those Royal Knights! Does Prince Trion think to undo all that my son has wrought? Does he?${prompt};
Have you heard of the Goddess of the Dawn?${prompt};
When the Gates of Paradise open, the Shining One will lead all San d'Orians to her celestial utopia.${prompt};
In the war twenty years ago, San d'Orian knights crushed the Shadow Lord and his hordes. We sealed off the Northlands from whence he came.${prompt};
Eh? Windurst and Bastok? They could barely protect their gates! If it weren't for the valor of our knights, all would have fallen into shadow!${prompt};
When I was young, San d'Oria was a beautiful city, where life was pleasant and the days were long.${prompt};
But now our rulers favor adventurers, drawing mobs of foreigners to town. Oh, my ears burn with their babbling!${prompt};
Hrmm... You look like another adventurer obsessed with shining swords and gleaming shields. Am I wrong?${prompt};
Well, the hallmark of an adventurer is a richly-decorated domicile. Really, you must visit the furniture shop!${prompt};
We've battled Orcs for years! And yet their ranks do not diminish.${prompt};
No, they are greater, pressing harder from the west. We must take Ghelsba before all is lost!${prompt};
Say, you see that little boy crrrying by the fountain?${prompt};
Maybe you could help him out. I'm no good with kids.${prompt};
Haha, I saw that. You rrreturned his fishing pole. How nice of you!${prompt};

If there are no objections, I would like to call the 136th Conquest Evaluation Assembly to a close.${prompt};
Just a moment.${prompt};
Prince Trion, is there something you wish to add?${prompt};
...;
I will not deny that the participation of adventurers has been of great benefit to the conquest, as well as maintained a new level of safety in the outlying regions.${prompt};
In addition, the many treaties signed by our nations have successfully paved a path of peace. No longer need our border guards fear attacks from our friends to the south and east.${prompt};
However, the beastman forces display no signs of weakening. Those noble guards stationed in faraway lands must deal with this reality constantly...and the burden has begun taking its toll.${prompt};
The already large gap between the guards on our borders and the guards in the Outlands expands with each day. If nothing is done, morale shall continue to fall while discontent grows.${prompt};
I sense that my kingdom is not alone in these worries.${prompt};
Soldier morale...${prompt};
Well, well, well! I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence from a member of the mighty d'Oraguille family!${prompt};
Ohohoho!;
I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence;
from Destin's baby boy--Trion, the prince.${prompt};
How dare you!?${prompt};
I think that is quite enough, Minister.${prompt};
I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt};
Doctor Shantotto...;
I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt};
In a republic like Bastok, where a large portion of our army is made up of normal citizens, it is easy for morale levels to slide. This is a problem that is constantly being tackled by our officials.${prompt};
Really?;
Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.${prompt};
Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to far-off places. It gives them the opportunity to run and jump and hunt and roll around in the mud--whatever those feminine felines like to do in their free time.${prompt};
Maybe instead of buffing up your soldiers' muscles all day, you should try training their minds...like we do. And that's my two gil!${prompt};
Oh, rea～lly?;
Well, that's your nation.;
We don't have such problems in the Federation.${prompt};
Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to faraway places.;
It gives them time to take their naps, hunt their mice, and go on their chases.${prompt};
Maybe it's to the lack of confidence that you can give thanks;
for the drastic fall of morale in your pathetic ranks.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt};
Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt};
The more regions under your nation's control, the more mercenaries you must hire. And before you realize it, your vaults will be empty.${prompt};
I suspect that the conquest is taking its toll on the Federation.${prompt};
Well, we...${prompt};
Ohohohoho!;
In a matter of months, our wishy-worries will be gone,;
When our Outland regions are patrolled by automatons.${prompt};
Operation costs will stay lower than low.;
And into our vaults the gil shall flow.;
Ohoho!${prompt};
Shantotto!${prompt};
If you wish, Windurst can also build some for use by the king and the president.;
All for a small fee payable in five easy installments.${prompt};
Ohohohoho!;
In a matter of months, our wishy-worries will be gone,;
when our Outland regions are patrolled by automatons.${prompt};
Operation costs will stay lower than low.;
And into our vaults the gil shall flow.;
Ohoho!${prompt};
While we appreciate the concern from Destin's baby and Karst's pet,;
I don't think Windurst will be taking any drastic actions yet.${prompt};
But if you wish, we could build some Cardians for use by the king and the president.;
All for a small fee payable in five easy installments.;
O～hohohohoho!${prompt};
That sounds like a lovely plan, Minister Shantotto.${prompt};
But wouldn't the use of automatons in the conquest be in violation of the Treaty of Nations...?${prompt};
Hmph.;
And I have heard many a tale of those walking scarecrows turning on their masters...${prompt};
Like father, like son, I say.;
I would not trust a lump of rubbish made by one of you lunatics any more than I would trust one of you lunatics!${prompt};
How can one call a soldier that does not obey his leader a soldier? And how can one call a leader who cannot control his soldiers a leader?${prompt};
Ooh, somebody's in a bad mood...${prompt};
Prince Trion.;
You certainly did not bring up this issue without having a solution in mind.${prompt};
Exactly!;
You'd better have something interesting to say.;
Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt};
Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt};
Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt};
Yes.;
Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt};
Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt};
Excenmille was furious.${prompt};
Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt};
According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt};
However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt};
That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt};
Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt};
...;
I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight.;
Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?${prompt};
Excenmille offered me with the following suggestion...${prompt};
Revive Conflict!${prompt};
...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
...!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
C-Conflict!?;
A series of games based on battle exercises, played by select heroes from each of the nations...${prompt};
Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War.;
You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt};
That is what I propose.${prompt};
Conflict...;
An interesting idea...${prompt};
There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt};
However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt};
If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt};
Prince Trion, Prince Trion.;
If that's all that you wanted to say,;
you didn't have to go beat around the bush all day.${prompt};
Windurst welcomes Conflict with open arms!;
A little feuding fun could do no harm.${prompt};
Shantotto!?${prompt};
Oh, there's nothing to get all excited about. The forces of Windurst are in good hands.;
A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.${prompt};
The forces of Windurst are in good hands.;
A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.${prompt};
And once we get our fearless loyal adventurers to help,;
it will be your two nations letting out cries and yelps.${prompt};
If San d'Oria and Windurst have agreed to participate, the president is sure to grant his approval.${prompt};
And I know our adventurers will be more than happy to take up their swords for the Republic.${prompt};
Excellent.;
I look forward to meeting you all again on the battlefield.${prompt};
Well...;
It is a rare occasion that all three nations agree on an issue.${prompt};
Unfortunately, ducal law prevents Jeuno from participating in such matters.${prompt};
However, we will assign officials to take part as Heralds and watch over the games.${prompt};
I have no objections.;
Now let us return to our nations and begin with the preparations.${prompt};
Then it has been decided.;
Sir Wolfgang.${prompt};
Ahem.;
Then, if there is nothing further, I call the 136th Conquest Evaluation Assembly to a close.${prompt};
Though I'd rather be sitting on the beach, catching some sun,;
sometimes these stuffy-snuffy meetings can be kind of fun!${prompt};
Though I'd rather be sitting on the beach, catching some sun,;
sometimes these stuffy-snuffy meetings can be kind of fun!${prompt};
I could take up my staff and participate in Conflict myself,;
but my super-duper whammy-slammy spells would be bad for my opponents' health!;
Ohohohohoho!${prompt};
What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Basic rules.;
About area-specific rules.;
About returning to battle.;
About special rules.;
Nothing at the moment.${prompt};
Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt};
The rules are simple.;
Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt};
Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt};
These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt};
Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt};
${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt};
Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt};
(1) Successfully throw them into a rook.;
(2) Leave the area.;
(3) Are knocked out.${prompt};
But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt};
As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt};
All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt};
However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt};
The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt};
Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt};
Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt};
So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt};
There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt};
To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook's${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt};
Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt};
This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt};
Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt};
The following match types are area-specific:;
All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest;
All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands;
Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt};
Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt};
Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt};
Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt};
When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt};
For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt};
After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt};
If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt};
Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.;
Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt};

Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt};
Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt};
If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt};
Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt};
Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt};
Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt};
While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt};
Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt};
However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.;
Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player's ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt};
All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt};
Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt};
During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt};
In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:;
Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt};
Level 40 matches: 31～40;
Level 50 matches: 41～50;
Level 60 matches: 51～60;
Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt};
Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt};
When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt};
Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt};

Basic Information.;
Registering Points.;
Rewards.;
Chevron & Title List.;
None.${prompt};
Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.${prompt};
Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.${prompt};
After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.${prompt};
If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special ${color: 5}chevron${color: 1} as well as a new ${color: 5}title${color: 1}.${prompt};
There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.${prompt};
Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.${prompt};
Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.${prompt};
However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.${prompt};
Finally, ${color: 5}checking${color: 1} someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.${prompt};

What shall you ask?;
${selection-lines};
About the coming Ballista matches.;
About the Ballista schedule.;
About Ballista Earrings.;
About the rules of Ballista.;
Nothing at the moment.${prompt};
The next match will be held shortly.;
Let me inform you of the details.${prompt};
Listen up, and I will give you a briefing on the details!${prompt};
The coming matches? I guess I could tell you what I know.${prompt};
There are no matches scheduled at this time. Of course, the moment there are, you shall be the first to know.${prompt};
I regret to inform you that there are no matches scheduled in the near future! That is all!${prompt};
The coming matches? I'm sorry. Currently there are no plans for any in the near future.${prompt};
Ah yes, the schedule. Let me read you the set of dates and times.${prompt};
Those fat cats up in Jeuno have finally finished worrrking on the fixed schedule. Let me fill you in on what has been decided.${prompt};
Remember, soldier, as long as I'm alive, the schedule I am about to tell you is set in stone! Try to find room in your puny head to fit it in!${prompt};
I understand this schedule may seem confusing, but it is really quite simple. Perhaps you should try writing the information down?${prompt};
Ah yes, I almost forgot to mention that once you have participated in a match, you must wait a short period until you can make your next entry. Take this into consideration when planning which matches you will attend.${prompt};
Did you get all that in your pea-sized brain, soldier!? If you can't handle a simple schedule like that one, you're too stupid to participate in Ballista! That is all!${prompt};
And!;
Once you have taken part in a match, you will not be able to immediately participate again. Think about this when choosing which matches to attend! That is all!${prompt};
Did you get all that?;
What? It's too complicated?;
Well, you can always do what I do and wrrrite it down.${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing. Once you've parrrticipated in a match, you must wait a few days before signing up again. Think about that when planning which days to attend.${prompt};
Your air...;
Your attire...;
An adventurer, I assume.;
Have you come looking to register for Conflict?${prompt};
I truly am sorry, but we are not accepting applications from those who have yet to prove their loyalty to the crown.${prompt};
However, do not let that dampen your spirits. I am positive the day will come when I can welcome you to our noble ranks.${prompt};
The future of our kingdom is riding on your shoulders.${prompt};
Wait a minute, don't tell me... You'rrre one of the Federation's adventurers, right? And you want to sign up for Conflict?${prompt};
Hmmm... I don't know...;
Your rank is awfully low. How am I supposed to trrrust someone who hasn't prrroved themselves to the nation?${prompt};
Get out there and do some missions, and I'll guarantee you a spot on our team. You look like you've got what it takes!${prompt};
What!?;
You think you're ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] enough to join our nation's Conflict forces!?${prompt};
Why, you're still a worthless maggot that hasn't done squat for the Republic! Come back when your rank is at least higher than your IQ!${prompt};
I'll be watching you, soldier!${prompt};
Your air...;
Your attire...;
An adventurer, I assume.;
Have you come looking to register for Conflict?${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am Excenmille M Aurchiat, acting Conflict Commander of the San d'Orian forces.${prompt};
I have heard good things about you, ${name-player}. Your loyalty to the crown is well-renowned throughout the Kingdom.${prompt};
I believe that you would make a fine addition to our ranks, and I welcome you.${prompt};
You have come to register for Conflict, have you not?${prompt};
Well, before you make a hasty decision, let me explain the finer details of what has transpired in recent months.${prompt};
It all began at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly held in conjunction with the International Commerce Convention. His Majesty, Prince Trion, made the following proposal...${prompt};
Do you understand?;
I was whom the prince was speaking of. And it is I who believe that your unmatched loyalty, bravery, and ability are necessary for the Kingdom's victory.${prompt};
If you are truly a servant of the crown, you shall not object to raising your sword in the name of the royaulais.${prompt};
I see...;
I realize that you adventurers have other matters that keep you busy.;
However, do not forget the debt you owe to the Kingdom that provides for you.${prompt};
Wait a minute, don't tell me... You'rrre one of the Federation's adventurers, right? And you want to sign up for Conflict?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Your rank seems high enough... OK! You'rrre in.;
I could use a veteran like you to whip some of my younger mercenaries into shape.${prompt};
My name's Mhabi Molkot. Up until a few days ago, I was Captain of the Terrible Tigresses, the most fearrred group of Mithra Mercenaries in all of Windurst!${prompt};
And then all of a sudden, they make me Conflict Commander...${prompt};
Anyway, I said you'rrre in, so you'rrre in already!;
What? Don't tell me you're having second thoughts!${prompt};
Let me tell you a little about what's been going on in the past few months. It all starrrted at some stuffy conference to talk about the conquest...${prompt};
And there you have it. The bigwigs up in the ministries probably hearrrd that I was a professional Conflict player back in my homeland, and entrrrusted me with the reins of this runaway horse.${prompt};
Maybe it's my instincts talking, but you look like the type who's dying for a chance at the hunt. What do you say?${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Hmph. Well, you've got guts. You're the first man who's ever turned this cat down./You're turrrning me down?];
But I know you'll be back. I can see it in your eyes...${prompt};
What!?;
You think you're ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] enough to join our nation's Conflict forces!?${prompt};
You think that just because you have a few missions under your belt that you're ready to play with the big boys!?${prompt};
Well, soldier, I've scraped bigger things than you off the bottom of my boot!${prompt};
Listen up!;
My name is Invincible Shield, Legatus of the third division of the Republican Legion.${prompt};
The president himself has made me Conflict Commander and put the Bastokan forces under my control. If you join, you will serve under me and under me only!${prompt};
What!? You have questions about Conflict!?;
I don't remember anyone giving you permission to ask questions, soldier!${prompt};
I will let it slide this time, but it better not happen again!;
Now, listen up!${prompt};
Did you understand what I just told you!?;
It is an honor and a privilege to participate in Conflict!${prompt};
You want to be a hero!? Well, here's your chance, soldier!;
Sign this application form and you can be on your way!${prompt};
More time!?;
And I thought you were more than just a whining sissy!;
The Republic doesn't need any more wimps like you!;
You are dismissed!${prompt};
So, you have finally realized your debt to the Kingdom and decided to repay that debt through service in Conflict?${prompt};
Well, look who's back. I knew you couldn't rrresist the excitement of Conflict. You're ready to sign up, right?${prompt};
I see that you have finally come to your senses, soldier!;
Now sign this application and you can be on your way!${prompt};
Excellent.;
However, there is one last task I must ask you to perform before approving your application.${prompt};
Travel to Bastok and Windurst and meet with their leaders. You need not worry with the details. They already know you will be coming.${prompt};
I also wish you to deliver these letters to the two nations' Conflict Commanders.${prompt};
A lofty Galka, Ginu...Invincible Shield, will be waiting for you in Bastok.${prompt};
And I recall the Commander of Windurst's forces was a Mithra named Mhabi...something-or-other. I have such trouble remembering foreign names.${prompt};
That is all. You may set off immediately.;
I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.${prompt};
Wonderful!;
I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.${prompt};
To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.${prompt};
And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.${prompt};
I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.${prompt};
Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!${prompt};
Heh heh heh...;
When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!${prompt};
You've made the right choice, soldier!;
From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!${prompt};
Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once!;
You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!${prompt};
What!?;
Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!?;
The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!${prompt};
After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations!;
Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!${prompt};
Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst!;
Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!${prompt};
You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes!;
Dismissed!!!${prompt};
Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt};
Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.${prompt};
What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.${prompt};
Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!${prompt};
Now listen up, soldier!;
After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot!;
And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!${prompt};
Welcome back from your journey.;
......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.${prompt};
Well done, ${name-player}.;
Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.${prompt};
Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost!;
...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, ${name-player}. You've just made my day.${prompt};
Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.${prompt};
Well done, soldier!;
I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!${prompt};
If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives!;
Don't you forget that, soldier!${prompt};
Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform!;
Get moving!${prompt};
I commend you, ${name-player}. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.${prompt};
As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.${prompt};
Ah, I almost forgot.;
Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.${prompt};
Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them.;
That is all.${prompt};
OK! You'rrre done. Here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.${prompt};
And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Oh yeah, I almost forgot...;
Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.${prompt};
They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!${prompt};
Well done, soldier!;
I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.${prompt};
We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!${prompt};
In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!${prompt};
While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!;
Dismissed!!!${prompt};
I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...${prompt};
All right, soldier, listen up!;
Repeat after me the following rules!${prompt};
Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...${prompt};
An exquisite display of force, ${name-player}!${prompt};
It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!${prompt};
Great job out there, ${name-player}!${prompt};
The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!${prompt};
Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory!;
But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!${prompt};
Now get back out there, soldier!;
Do you want to live forever!?${prompt};
Unthinkable...;
A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.${prompt};
If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt};
I cannot believe what I am hearing...;
A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...${prompt};
Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt};
You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...${prompt};
Ahem!;
Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}! You'rrre making me look bad!${prompt};
Hissssss!;
You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...${prompt};
Ahem!;
Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!${prompt};
Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!;
What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!${prompt};
Why did you fail!?;
What did you do wrong!?;
And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?;
Do not make me repeat these words, ${name-player}! Dismissed!!!${prompt};
Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!;
You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched!;
But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!${prompt};
Why did you fail!?;
What did you do wrong!?;
And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?;
Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!${prompt};
I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...${prompt};
Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!${prompt};
A draw!;
A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!${prompt};
You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again!;
Dismissed!${prompt};
So close, yet so farrr...${prompt};
Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?${prompt};
You wish to know about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.${prompt};
While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.${prompt};
You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.${prompt};
You want to see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Here, take a look.;
These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.${prompt};
When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.${prompt};
He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.${prompt};
Listen up, soldier!;
In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!${prompt};
And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!${prompt};
Ask for an earring?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
A wise decision, ${name-player}. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.${prompt};
Here, let me put it on for you.;
Hmmm...;
You look great!;
Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!${prompt};
Smart move, soldier!;
Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!${prompt};
I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.${prompt};
Well, if you think that you don't need one...${prompt};
If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!${prompt};
What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
How's the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} worrrking? Or maybe you don't need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.${prompt};
Is there something wrong with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt};
Return the earring?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.${prompt};
Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.${prompt};
Well, it's about time!;
I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own!;
Dismissed!!!${prompt};
What is this?;
I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?${prompt};
???;
If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.${prompt};
Does this look like Windurst, maggot!?;
If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force!;
Move! Move! Move!${prompt};
What is this?;
I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!${prompt};
Are you talking to me?;
Are you talking to me?;
Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.${prompt};
What is that smell!?;
Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer!;
If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!${prompt};
Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license...;
I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.${prompt};
Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...${prompt};
Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation!;
What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!${prompt};
Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?${prompt};
You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers.;
However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.${prompt};
Wait, don't tell me...;
You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!?;
(Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)${prompt};
Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?;
Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt};
So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?;
It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt};
I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt};
What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt};
.........;
How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt};
You!;
Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!${prompt};
A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...${prompt};
.........;
Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt};
Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt};
What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?${prompt};
.........;
If he thinks that I...${prompt};
You!;
You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe!;
Now get out of my face!!!${prompt};
A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!${prompt};
.........;
I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!${prompt};
You!;
Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!${prompt};
A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!${prompt};
.........;
Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt};
You!;
You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!${prompt};
What is that you have there, maggot!?;
A shopping list from your mommy!?${prompt};
.........;
Th...vixen...sh...I...ki...${prompt};
You!;
You tell that worthless commander of yours that she can scream and she can cry, but I will show her no mercy on the battlefield!;
Now get out of my face!!!${prompt};
Excellent show, ${name-player}!;
I have just received word that ${choice: 0}[you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].${prompt};
"I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!${prompt}";
I just received the news, ${name-player}! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.${prompt};
I applaud you on your skill! Maybe it's time I challenged you to a little one-on-one...${prompt};
Well, if it isn't the pond scum I found floating on my toilet this morning... What is this? You mean to tell me that you ${choice: 0}[were awarded some fancy chevron!?/were the top scorer at the last Ballista match!?] I... I...${prompt};
What are you looking at, soldier!? Haven't you seen anyone with dust in their eye!?;
Just because by some fluke you had a fine day on the Ballista field doesn't mean squat!;
Now get back out there, ${name-player}!${prompt};
I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt};
After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt};
A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--;
Kupopo!?${prompt};
The moogle appears to have received a message...!;
G-grave news, kupo!!!;
Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt};
Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt};
Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!;
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt};
We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt};
To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
When you plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!${prompt};
Alright then!;
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!${prompt};
Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!;
Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt};
A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt};
Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt};
But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! Great!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt};
The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.${prompt};
You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! I like your enthusiasm!;
Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt};
After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}${prompt};
We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have in your possession, kupo!${prompt};
Nooo, that ${item-singular: 0[2]} won't do.;
Come back again after you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo!;
You've absorbed ${choice: 0}[a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!${prompt};
Thanks, kupo.;
We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!${prompt};
You can purify absorbed malice by planting your ${item-singular: 0[2]} here.${prompt};
A mysterious power absorbs the malice!${prompt};
Please select absorption value.;

What's this? You're still new to this land?;
I'm afraid you're not yet strong enough to handle our potent moogle magic!;
Just forget I said anything, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, what a shame! The mog tablets have been scattered to the winds once more!;
Without their power, I'm afraid we can't help you, kupo.${prompt};

Assignments, or “hunts,” can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.${prompt};
Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference.;
As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.${prompt};

More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments.;
Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.${prompt};

I say! Watch where you're going!${prompt};
Oh, a new recruit, are you? That explains it!${prompt};
Well, far be it from me to chastise someone on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] first day. Still, as a citizen of San d'Oria, you--${prompt};
Ah, Nonterene! What are you doing here?${prompt};
Prince Trion, I was explaining to this recruit here about what it means to be a proud citizen of San d'Oria!${prompt};
A recruit? Strengthen your sword arm and your stature as a knight. Thus will you best serve the glory of our great kingdom.${prompt};
San d'Oria has more than enough soldiers already, brother. Speaking of which, should you not be training them, instead of bothering new recruits with talk of war?${prompt};
You are too bold!${prompt};
Really, Pieuje! Is that any way to speak to your brother?${prompt};
I've said the truth, nothing more. The ranks of our armies could swell to bursting, and victory would still be far.${prompt};
It is your head that is swollen, brother. With enough numbers, we could crush the beastmen! And without having to resort to your misguided tactics!${prompt};
My tactics, misguided? Oh, that is rich! Tell me of the tactics that lost an entire company in Batallia Downs the other day?${prompt};
It's good you're so fond of talking, as I've never seen you wield a sword! Better to shout orders from the rear than reveal your ineptitude in actual combat!${prompt};
Stop your quarreling, both of you!${prompt};
A divided leadership only creates unrest among the people, soldier and civilian alike. Surely you are both aware of this?${prompt};
Oh, I suppose. I warn you, Pieuje, talk to me that way again and I won't be so forgiving.${prompt};
Good old Trion. Threats of violence are his only recourse when a conversation does not go his way. Like a child, he is!${prompt};
They are both like children, quick to insult and quicker to take offense! Really...${prompt};
I must apologize for that. But ours is truly a great kingdom, and I expect you to further her glory.${prompt};
Those two are a handful, but they truly are the closest of brothers.${prompt};
You seem lost, recruit. Tell me if there's anything you wish to know.${prompt};
Something you'd like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing in particular.;
I want to go out and fight!;
I want to go shopping.;
I want to know more about adventuring.${prompt};
Just arrived and you're already aching to leave, eh? Listen, the land is wild beyond our gates, filled with fiends and their ilk.${prompt};
If you must go outside, head through Ranperre Gate. Allow me to explain.${prompt};
Right now we're on the Parade Grounds. Find the gate to the west.${prompt};
Step through and pass the furniture store and the inn. Take the gate on the left.${prompt};
Make another left down the stairs. You'll see Ranperre Gate beyond.${prompt};
Should you need directions, ask those around you. Our citizens are friendly, for the most part.${prompt};
Wait, wait--one more thing. If someone aids you, be sure to show them your gratitude. That is all.${prompt};
For weapons and basic supplies, take a walk through the city and you'll find all that you need.${prompt};
Recruits... Don't know which way to hold a sword and you think you're ready. Well, what would you like to know?${prompt};
You really are a handful! You need to go to Novice's Hall. Head through Victory Arch, across the courtyard, and through the gate you'll see on the right.${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Hunting monsters.;
Making easy money.;
Working for my country.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! I saw a lady in front of a house on Pikeman's Way who may be in need of assistance.${prompt};
Novices... Don't know your own limits until a fiend beats it into your head for you. Very well. How about gathering some hides for the Tanners' Guild in Southern San d'Oria?${prompt};
Southern San d'Oria is just beyond Victory Arch there. Pass through and go west. You'll find the Tanners' Guild soon enough.${prompt};
Easy money, eh? Typical! I can't promise ease, but check the lumberyard on Laborman's Way. They should have some work for you.${prompt};
Go through the gate to the west and pass the Phoenix Perch Inn. You should see another gate there to your right. That gate leads to Laborman's Way.${prompt};
Ah, a commendable choice! Each entrance to the city has a gatehouse. Tell the guards there you wish to work for the glory of the Kingdom!${prompt};
Here, take this. It's an adventurer coupon. Give it to Matildie in front of Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
To hand items to others, select “Trade” from the main menu. That should be easy enough for a new recruit to understand.${prompt};
What do you want?${prompt};
Ah, a new recruit! What are you doing in the city? Get out there and slay some fiends! That's where the money is!${prompt};
Speaking of money, I haven't seen that gambler all day. Has he run off again?${prompt};
You know him. I reckon he's out scouring the Parade Grounds for suckers with gil to wager.${prompt};
Who does he think he is, running off when we've piles of work to do! I'll give him a good lashing when he gets back!${prompt};
Gambling is the ruin of many, I tell you...${prompt};
A gambler? Oh, you mean Varchet. He went strolling through Victory Arch just a while ago.${prompt};
He's probably at some tavern by now. You'd best stay away from gamblers like him.${prompt};
He was a knight, once, and always loved games of chance. They say his habit eventually cost him his knighthood.${prompt};
Hey, it's that recruit from before. So you're the one who got Varchet to show up again!${prompt};
I don't remember asking you to fetch him, but I owe you my thanks anyway. Here, take this!${prompt};
Eh? That gambler, Varchet? Aye, he was just here.${prompt};
Varchet? I gave him a proper lashing for what he did, and then he ran off again! He's not to be trusted, that one.${prompt};
A magic shop, you say? A bit of magic would come in handy... I know! I'll have my daughter study it for me!${prompt};
Weary traveler, come pray with us.${prompt};
Here in the San d'Oria Cathedral, we devote our lives to helping people reach the shining gates of Paradise.${prompt};
Should you wish to know more about Paradise, come to the vicasque's sermon. Much will be revealed.${prompt};
Should you wish to hear the sermon, please prepare an offering of ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as proof of your faith.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to bring the water. Please beseech the friar who stands thither.${prompt};
Welcome. I distribute material goods for visitors to our cathedral.${prompt};
Should you seek ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, step forth! I humbly ask for a donation of 10 gil.${prompt};
Make a donation?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, of course.;
No, I will not.${prompt};
You donate 10 gil.${prompt};
Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} to East Ronfaure. “Trade” it to the Cheval River to draw its hallowed water!${prompt};
May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt};
That is unfortunate. Truly unfortunate...${prompt};
Present that ${item-singular: 0[2]} to Miageau. Stands he at the portal.${prompt};
Admirable is your generosity, but this is not ${item-singular: 0[2]} .${prompt};
Thank you. Sacred is the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you conveyed hither.${prompt};
In testament to your devotion, I give you this ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Through it, Altana's providence is yours.${prompt};
The Cheval runs through East Ronfaure. Exit the city through the Eastgate, and head north until you come to a small bridge over the river.${prompt};
Stand upon the bridge in peace... Then “trade” your ${item-singular: 0[2]} to draw the sacred water!${prompt};
Once you have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, return to me, Miageau.${prompt};
My ${choice-player-gender}[son/child], your offering of ${item-singular: 0[2]} was generous enough. You need not obtain another waterskin.${prompt};
Oh, where could he be?${prompt};
I-I came here with my father, and now he's g-gone!${prompt};
My father is a knight! Today he's on holiday, and so we went out for a walk. B-but now...${prompt};
M-my father is so proud of his knighthood, he's still in uniform today. He looks noble indeed, though his armor creaks with each step!${prompt};
He's not wearing his helmet, though... We came through Victory Arch together but, but now...${prompt};
Oh, Father! Where are you?${prompt};
What's that? My son, at the Parade Grounds, crying? I'm busy here, so could you let him know I'll go as soon as I'm done?${prompt};
What? Y-you found my father?${prompt};
Ailbeche?${prompt};
Father?;
Why, you milksop! Lose sight of your father and all you do is wail for the nearest stranger? Have you no shame?${prompt};
B-but, Father...${prompt};
Enough! You are Elvaan! I expect more from you! Understand?${prompt};
B-but, Father! No...${prompt};
I'll forge you into shape yet! Now, stand there till you get a hold of yourself!${prompt};
No, Father! Don't leave me!;
Let me apologize for my son. Please accept this in return for your time.${prompt};
No! Th-that's my fishing rod... Father!${prompt};
Quiet! I will not have my own son cry like a baby!${prompt};
Good day, adventurer!${prompt};
Confound it! What am I to do?${prompt};
What's the matter, Montaube? Why aren't you cooking supper for the guests?${prompt};
That's just the problem! I started the soup, see, and then I realized I've no batagreens! The broth is but water without it!${prompt};
Now that's odd. Just this morning, I asked Boncort to fetch one...${prompt};
Bon-bon!${prompt};
Yes, Master Abeaule?${prompt};
Where are the batagreens I asked for?${prompt};
Oh, I forgot to tell you! The grocer said his herb-man ran into Orcs, so he couldn't get any today!${prompt};
I searched every stall in the city, but there wasn't a sprig to be found! Honest!${prompt};
Well, how can I make my sheep-head stew without batagreens?${prompt};
Bon-bon, go track down this herb-man yourself!${prompt};
Do you think I'm mad? Who would greet the guests if Orcs got me?${prompt};
Now, now... Simmer down, lads.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Madam], you're an adventurer, are you not? We can't leave the city with fiends on the road, so we need your help.${prompt};
Our trader, a supplier of fresh produce, works from a tower on the southern edge of West Ronfaure. Might you procure ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for us?${prompt};
Of course, you'll be paid for your time. What do you say?${prompt};
Well?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
I must decline.${prompt};
Ah, too bad, You got my hopes up.${prompt};
So, you've had a change of heart, have you?${prompt};
Splendid! Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} to Phairet. He's in a tower far south into West Ronfaure. He'll hand you ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in return!${prompt};
We always pay after delivery, so you needn't give him any money!${prompt};
Bring back that ${item-singular: 1[2]} as quick as you can, eh? And don't drop the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, either!${prompt};
You've lost it?;
${selection-lines};
No, it's right here!;
Sorry...${prompt};
Ah, that's a relief.${prompt};
For the love of--! Ah, well, I suppose I can write you up another one. Don't you lose it again, now!${prompt};
Sorry, no time to chat! I've yet to finish cleaning the rooms.${prompt};
Begging your pardon, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam], but I'm cooking right now. If you've got something for me, it'll just have to wait.${prompt};
Oooh, this is a fine ${item-singular: 0[2]}! Fit for our guests' soup!${prompt};
Here, this is yours for your trouble. Thank you!${prompt};
You're my favorite adventurer! Thanks again for your help!${prompt};
Eh, what's this? I've no need of this clutter.${prompt};
Welcome, weary traveler. The vicasque will soon begin today's sermon.${prompt};
Have you come to hear the sermon? Good, the vicasque will begin soon.${prompt};
Believers, today's sermon will now begin.${prompt};
Kindly reflect upon his words in silence.${prompt};
All of Altana's children are welcome here.${prompt};
Is this your first time here? Join us in prayer!${prompt};
Paradise is a place without fear, without death!${prompt};
Papsque Shamonde sometimes addresses the city from the balcony, you know. I long for his blessing, if but once!${prompt};
With each sermon, I take another step closer to Paradise.${prompt};
Truly fortunate are we that words of sacrament are read every day!${prompt};
Goddess above, deliver us to Paradise!${prompt};
I shall begin shortly. Should you have questions, kindly beseech the friar at the narthex.${prompt};
My children, welcome. Today I would like to speak about Paradise.${prompt};
In this world, we are born to wither and die. Every mortal is bound by these chains.${prompt};
Only the chosen may pass through the gates of Paradise, to live forever under Altana, free from fear and decay.${prompt};
Here in the San d'Oria Cathedral, we devote each day to helping believers along the blessed path.${prompt};
Though the road to Paradise is fraught with peril, there is no other way to life everlasting.${prompt};
Altana has guided us here today. Toward the gates of Paradise we walk together, one step at a time.${prompt};
My children, as you prepare to take your first step, remember that naught is as important as the spirit of giving.${prompt};
Providence shall come with the renunciation of greed. The one treasure we may keep is generosity!${prompt};
Now, I recall a friar on retreat in East Ronfaure.${prompt};
He spends his days fasting in prayer, pausing only to eat blue peas.${prompt};
In reverence of his devotion, let us deliver him sustenance!${prompt};
Beseech Friar Abioleget at the narthex, so that he might entrust the peas to you.${prompt};
Eschew all desire, give yourself to Altana, and she will bless you in her glory.${prompt};
And with these words, I send you. May her light shine upon you, always.${prompt};
I will provide you with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for a pittance of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
Take you this ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Within a tower in East Ronfaure shall you find the friar.${prompt};
You shall carry the peas to the friar, and return hither.${prompt};
We recognize your conviction. Today, you are a step closer to Paradise!${prompt};
To honor your devotion, I bestow upon you this blessing.${prompt};
See Friar Abioleget at the narthex so he may hear of your service. Quickly, now!${prompt};
Go now, my child. Know in your heart that Altana watches over you.${prompt};
This is the entrance to the watchtower, which overlooks the woods of Ronfaure.${prompt};
You're on watch today? What's the password, then?${prompt};
You're new here, aren't you? First, target me, then type /pass password Where “password” is the password, get it?${prompt};
That's good enough for me. Follow the guard's instructions once you're inside, and you'll do fine.${prompt};
－－見張り塔内部へゾーンします－－${prompt};
That's not it. Better go ask again, eh?${prompt};
おう、あんたか。;
こないだはありがとよ。${prompt};
東ロンフォールへ仕事に行ってる;
（仲間の名）に届け物をしたいんだが、誰も;
今行ける者がいなくて困ってたんだ。${prompt};
そこで、あんたに頼みがあるんだ。;
この（アイテム）を（仲間）のところへ;
届けてきてほしいんだ。${prompt};
もちろん、報酬はきちんと払う。;
どうだ、ひとっ走り、行ってくれないか？${prompt};
${prompt};
おお、そりゃ助かるよ。仲間の名前は;
（木こり）だ。東ロンフォールのどこかに;
いるはずだから${prompt};
Greetings, faithful one. Have you come to hear the vicasque's sermons? Indeed they are the surest way to Paradise.${prompt};
I study scripture so that I, too, may one day give sermons like Vicasque Arnau.${prompt};
In this chamber we study the teachings of Altana. Through years of prayer and devotion have we earned this right.${prompt};
By the way, I have heard of your deeds, and I would ask of you a trivial favor.${prompt};
One of our order is on retreat at the Crag of Holla. Might you take him scrolls for his next circle?${prompt};
How unfortunate! I fear your place in Paradise may be in jeopardy.${prompt};
Great is the generosity in your heart! Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and carry it to Friar Faurbellant at the Crag of Holla.${prompt};
Friar Faurbellant is on retreat at the Crag of Holla. Please give ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to him.${prompt};
Gracious are we for your service. Receive this as acknowledgment of your devotion.${prompt};
"Friars spend every day in ascetic training. Greet them kindly; it will inspire them to strive ever harder.${prompt}";
How may I help you?${prompt};
I'm in a hurry, my good fellow! I need five iron swords, and quick!${prompt};
I can only do what I can do, no more.${prompt};
I was ordered by the captain himself! We're sending a force to Batallia Downs tomorrow, and they need blades!${prompt};
I don't care who's ordered what! I can't make blades without iron, now, can I? If you want them that badly, bring me metal!${prompt};
Stop it right now, the both of you. This is a place of business!${prompt};
Hmph... You're right. But how am I to get the iron?${prompt};
Why don't you just cop some weapons from Orcs in Ghelsba? Kill two birds with one stone, that way.${prompt};
You mean, melt down the Orcish weapons to make new ones? Now, that's an idea. How many would you need?${prompt};
Hmm... I'd say about 10 knives, give or take a blade.${prompt};
Then speed is our ally! Quick, you go to the forest and I will report back to the captain.${prompt};
Eh? I'm a blacksmith! I make swords, not use 'em! I'm not fighting no Orcs.${prompt};
Mind your tongue, insolent smith! Do you not know who I am? I am Lord Ancolain, officer of the Royal Knights!${prompt};
Really, behave yourselves! Why don't you just go find an adventurer to do the job?${prompt};
Things aren't usually this rough around here, really. Say, you look like a bit of an adventurer, yourself. How about it?${prompt};
You're an adventurer, right? As you may have heard, we're in need of your services.${prompt};
Listen to what he has to say?;
${selection-lines};
Listen.;
Turn away.${prompt};
My... Adventurers these days! Too busy to lend a helping hand.${prompt};
Listen close, they are many Orcs in the camps of Ghelsba, and some carry knives.${prompt};
Might you be able to gather ten of those knives and bring them here? We've not much time.${prompt};
How fare you? Have you gotten the knives?${prompt};
Looks like you've got ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[knife/knives] so far. Bring ${number: 1} more, and please hurry!${prompt};
Our stalwart adventurer has returned! You've brought all ten! Let's have them, then.${prompt};
That's 10 Orcish knives. Perfect, and thank you.${prompt};
I...see.${prompt};
I'm right in the middle of something important. Please be quiet.${prompt};
Can't you see I'm busy? If you've some business, talk to me later.${prompt};
It seems that officer is in a pickle. Maybe you could help him out, eh?${prompt};
That officer was singing in praise of you. Aye, you've the makings of a fine adventurer!${prompt};
It's a sign of troubled times when we're this busy. I appreciate the extra gil, but worrying for my skin isn't worth it.${prompt};
A smith is not judged by his strength, but by his skill in his art!${prompt};
This is the reliquary, where our late papsque, Muchavatte, is interred.${prompt};
We continue our spiritual discipline here, so that we may reach Paradise like His Holiness before us.${prompt};
Behold the candles on either side of the epitaph. Vigilantly their flames have burned since the departure of Papsque Muchavatte.${prompt};
They are placed here to light his way to Paradise.${prompt};
But many a candle are needed to keep his journey alight. Ever must the faithful bring ${item-plural: 0[2]} for candle-making.${prompt};
We humbly ask visitors to donate two ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Would you make an offering?${prompt};
Altana smiles on the generous. Once you have obtained two ${item-plural: 0[2]}, carry them hither.${prompt};
Surely the late papsque frowns upon you. Return hither when you remember charity.${prompt};
May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt};
I thank you for offering two ${item-plural: 0[2]}. The late papsque would be pleased.${prompt};
In thanks for your service, the San d'Oria Cathedral presents you with this ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Wear it, and Altana's providence will be yours.${prompt};
I thank you for your generous offering, but I am afraid I cannot accept this.${prompt};
I await your offering.${prompt};
Thank you for your generous service.${prompt};
Ah, if it isn't our favorite adventurer! The guests were overjoyed, thanks to you.${prompt};
Actually, we're in need of your help again...if you have the time, that is.${prompt};
One of our guests from last night has caught cold. We'd like to help, but we've no medicine, you see.${prompt};
There is an old woman named Amaura, a brewer of salves and medicines, in Southern San d'Oria. Might you be able to fetch one from her?${prompt};
Of course there's something in it for you, too. What do you say?${prompt};
So, you've decided to talk to Amaura for us?${prompt};
I see... I'll just have to look for someone else. Come by again if you change your mind.${prompt};
I knew you were the one to ask, as always!${prompt};
Amaura makes her home on Watchdog Alley. If you can't find her, ask someone along the way. I'll be waiting here!${prompt};
Ah, just the stuff! I'll buy it from you and give it to the guest right away!${prompt};
You've been a great help, again. I don't know how to thank you!${prompt};
Hrm... Mysteries... Why is this part different from all the rest?${prompt};
A receipt, eh? I can't read this fancy writing. Who's it for? Prince Trion, or Prince Pieuje?${prompt};
Who is it for?;
${selection-lines};
Prince Trion.;
Prince Pieuje.${prompt};
（トリオン様に渡してほしい。）${prompt};
（ピエージェ様に渡してほしい。）${prompt};
All right, I'll deliver it for you. We can't let you in looking like that! Wait here.${prompt};
I delivered the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Prince Trion. You're dismissed.${prompt};
I delivered the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to Prince Pieuje. You're dismissed.${prompt};
Imbecile! That envelope was for Prince Trion, not Prince Pieuje! Such idiocy... Get out of here!${prompt};
Imbecile! That envelope was for Prince Pieuje, not Prince Trion! Such idiocy... Get out of here!${prompt};
Oh, and tell that shopkeeper to send someone respectable next time!${prompt};
I've delivered the receipt. Give the prince's regards to that shopkeeper.${prompt};
Nothing to report.${prompt};
Behold Chateau d'Oraguille, the greatest fortress in the realm!${prompt};
You stand before Chateau d'Oraguille. If you've no business here, begone!${prompt};
Hey! Who said you could go in? Get back here, scum!${prompt};
Proceed!${prompt};
This is Victory Arch. Beyond lies Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
You stand before Victory Arch. Southern San d'Oria is on the other side.${prompt};
This gate leads to Port San d'Oria.${prompt};
This is Ranperre Gate. Fiends lurk in the lands beyond, so take caution!${prompt};
Blessed are those who cherish Altana and heed the word of the papsque. To them the Gates of Paradise will open.${prompt};
We're here to see the papsque address the faithful. He sometimes stands at the cathedral balcony beneath the steeple.${prompt};
Hmm... His Holiness should appear soon.${prompt};
I see him! The papsque!${prompt};
Yes, there he is!${prompt};
Beloved San d'Oria, Altana watches over us, always.${prompt};
She is the ally of the weak. She feeds the hungry and clothes the needy.${prompt};
She has given us the path to eternal Paradise. By this trial shall she judge us all.${prompt};
May Paradise open its gates to all her children!${prompt};
His words resound in my heart, long after they are spoken.${prompt};
Every time I see the papsque, I feel as though I'm one step closer to Paradise!${prompt};
Everyone should seek blessing from the papsque himself!${prompt};
Welcome to the Consulate of Jeuno. I am Galahad, Consul to San d'Oria.${prompt};
May I assist you?${prompt};
If you have business with Consul Galahad, you'll find him inside.${prompt};
Welcome to the Consulate of Jeuno.${prompt};
Hello there. I'm the consul from Bastok. Name's Helaku.${prompt};
I'm Consul Helaku. Didn't you bring ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Oh well, just take a look around then. Might as well enjoy the place while you're here.${prompt};
Pardon me, but we're in the middle of a very important discussion here.${prompt};
You're here with business from the administration, correct? I believe you should talk to Consul Helaku.${prompt};
You're here with business from the administration, correct? You should probably talk to Consul Helaku.${prompt};
Welcome to the Consulate of Bastok.${prompt};
A San d'Orian, huh? This is the Consulate of Bastok. We're here to serve travelers from Bastok.${prompt};
A Windurstian, huh? This is the Consulate of Bastok. The Consulate of Windurst is right outside.${prompt};
Consul Helaku? Go in.${prompt};
Really? You don't say... Thank you.${wait-animation: 3}${prompt};
You've come all the way from Bastok, have you? I'm Lion, a traveling adventurer, you might say.${prompt};
You've come all the way from Windurst, have you? I'm Lion, a traveling adventurer, you might say.${prompt};
Have you heard? The Orcs have a new forward base in Ghelsba, to the northwest. Now their greedy eyes are turned towards this land!${prompt};
Orcs are cruel and violent. They attack wayfarers on the road, and steal children, all to inspire terror in the San d'Orian people.${prompt};
But, there's one thing that just doesn't make sense.${prompt};
Orcs never were known for their craft, but they carry even better armor and weapons lately.${prompt};
I suspect there's someone behind the Orcs, pulling the strings, if you get me.${prompt};
Someone has to figure out their plans and take action, before this country falls to an Orcish invasion!${prompt};
People whisper in the streets of trouble in the royal house. They should focus on what's outside their walls first, if you ask me.${prompt};
Well, I don't expect things will be getting any easier around here for a while yet, but you take care, all the same.${prompt};
You must be tired from your trip. But first, let me get you up to speed on the situation here in San d'Oria.${prompt};
Northwest of the city is an Orc village. They call it Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt};
Our reports tell us that the Orcs are using Ghelsba as a forward base for an upcoming invasion of San d'Oria, but there's a few things that just don't fit.${prompt};
We all know that Orcs are beastmen, right? To say they're low on brains would be an understatement.${prompt};
Which is why I wonder how they came by the high-quality armor and weapons they've been using. Not to mention the ranged weapons and devices!${prompt};
We suspect there's someone behind the beastmen calling the shots, but we've no idea who.${prompt};
I wish I could send you to Ghelsba immediately, but in this region official missions require San d'Orian approval.${prompt};
What I want you to do is go to Chateau d'Oraguille and speak to Monarlais Halver. He'll issue you a formal mission order.${prompt};
"Leave this building, and you'll see a great fortress to the right. That's Chateau d'Oraguille. And be polite; San d'Orians can be quite touchy.${prompt}";
Looks like Lord Halver gave you your orders. Good luck, and be careful out there.${prompt};
It is good to see you are well! Lord Helaku will be pleased to see you again.${prompt};
Welcome back! You didn't get hurt, did you?${prompt};
Monarlais Halver tells me you went to defeat Warchief Vatgit, eh?${prompt};
A lot of adventurers make their way into the Ghelsba Outpost, but most turn around once they get up to the higher encampment.${prompt};
Well, you've done a great job. As consul, I'm honored to congratulate you on a mission well done.${prompt};
I'll be sure San d'Oria makes you a certified adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now that that's settled, your next goal is Windurst! It's a wild world out there, so keep your wits about you.${prompt};
What's this? Here, take it back.${prompt};
"Just the thing! I count ${number: 0}; no more, no less. Good job, ${name-player}.${prompt}";
Next stop: Windurst, eh? Good luck, and watch yourself out there!${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, is it? I heard good things about you from Consul Melek in Windurst.${prompt};
San d'Oria is locked in battle with the Orcish horde. It's tough on the townsfolk. They can't even go outside without fearing for their lives these days.${prompt};
The royal house is trying to suppress the beastmen. But with so much intrigue in the royal family, they can't take decisive action!${prompt};
But I shouldn't keep you here too long. I don't know the details of your special assignment, myself.${prompt};
You are to head to Chateau d'Oraguille and speak to the San d'Orian monarlais Lord Halver. He'll tell you all you need to know.${prompt};
You've done it again! You make me proud!${prompt};
You've been officially certified by the King of San d'Oria. Now all there's to do is to go home and get your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, and you'll be an official adventurer.${prompt};
Make haste back to the homeland and go to see Naji by the President's Office. He'll be waiting for you.${prompt};
Also, I'd be much obliged if you could bring this report back when you go. Don't forget to give it to him, now.${prompt};
You'd best get back to the homeland. Naji is probably wondering where you are by now.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}! You look well! Stay as long as you like. You deserve a rest, my friend.${prompt};
Greetings! I am Consul Kasaroro, at your service. How may I help you?${prompt};
I am Consul Kasaroro. What? You don't have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? You'll have to bring one if you've business with me!${prompt};
Welcome to the Consulate of Windurst!${prompt};
If it's the consul you're a-seeking, she's inside!${prompt};
A San d'Orian, are you? This is the Consulate of Windurst. We provide all sorts of aid to our countrymen here.${prompt};
A Bastoker, are you? This is the Consulate of Windurst. If you're looking for your consulate, it's out the door and across the way.${prompt};
Welcome to the Consulate of Windurst. Consul Kasaroro is inside, if you're looking forrr her.${prompt};
You've come on orders from the homeland, have you? You should speak with Consul Kasaroro.${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}! I am Consul Kasaroro. Let me tell you about current events here in the Kingdom of San d'Oria.${prompt};
Beastmen known as Orcs steadily grow in number outside San d'Oria.${prompt};
They have set up a forward base in Ghelsba, northwest of San d'Oria. From here, they plan to launch an invasion!${prompt};
Orcs love battle-wattle, but they aren't the brightest bunch. There's just one thing...${prompt};
It seems their armor and weapons have been improving by the day-way! Now they're using traps and bows, too!${prompt};
I, and a few others, think that there's somebody behind these Orcs, supplying them with the goods, and calling the shots. But there's not enough to go on right now.${prompt};
If it were up to me, I'd send you to Ghelsba pronto! But this is San d'Oria, and missions are their jurisdiction.${prompt};
So, first you should talk to Monarlais Halver in Chateau d'Oraguille. He'll give you official orders.${prompt};
Step right outside, and you'll see a big castle on the left. That's Chateau d'Oraguille. They're a little touchy in there, so mind your manners!${prompt};
So you've gotten an offer-woffer from Monarlais Halver? Excellent! Take care out there.${prompt};
Welcome back. I trust you weren't hurtaru?${prompt};
I heard from the monarlais that you went to fight-wight the great Warchief Vatgit!${prompt};
A great many adventurers see Ghelsba Outpost on missions, but most turn back at the highland encampmentaru!${prompt};
You've done swellsy-wellsy! I'm proud to be your consul.${prompt};
I'll formally request the San d'Orian court to certify you, ${name-player}, as an official adventurer.${prompt};
Now all you have to do is get recognition from Bastok. Keep your wits about you, and you'll be finey-shiney!${prompt};
This isn't what I asked for. Take it backeddy-wackeddy!${prompt};
Ah! ${number: 0}! Thank you very much. Your mission here is completaru!${prompt};
Now you just have to complete a mission for Bastok! It's a dangerous world out there, so take care-beware!${prompt};
Why, it's ${name-player}! I heard about your success from Consul Patt-Pott in Bastok. Sounds like you've done a bang-up job!${prompt};
That Patt-Pott talks a malm-a-minute, so it was hard to make out what he was saying at firstaru...${prompt};
But that's neither here nor there-where! The war goes on here in San d'Oria, and the civilians are trying to cope.${prompt};
I know the Kingdom wants to settle things quickly, but with all the hubbub going on in the royal family, they can't focus on the war!${prompt};
There's a special mission waiting for you. Even I haven't heard what it's all aboutaru!${prompt};
You'll have to head to Chateau d'Oraguille and ask Monarlais Halver. He'll fill you in, he will!${prompt};
I've heard of what you did, and I have to say I'm impressed! You make me proud to be a Windurstian!${prompt};
I hear you've been officially recognized by San d'Oria, too. The next time you return to the homeland, pick up your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Also, when you do go back, could you hand this report to Lady Kupipi, at the Heavens Tower? Don't forgetaru!${prompt};
Now, back home you go! I'm sure Lady Kupipi eagerly awaits your return.${prompt};
${name-player}, right? You seem well-swell! Feel free to hang around as long as you like!${prompt};
All right, once more!${prompt};
One!${prompt};
Two!${prompt};
Stop!${prompt};
What's the meaning of this? Don't interrupt!${prompt};
Welcome. We have all kinds of furnishings here!${prompt};
How can I help you?${prompt};
A pickpocket, you say? Come to think of it, I did see a scoundrel skulking about...${prompt};
Hmm... I've no idea what you're talking about.${prompt};
A pickpocket? No, can't say I've seen anyone like that. I'll keep an eye out, though.${prompt};
A pickpocket? I've got bigger fish to fry! Ask someone else.${prompt};
A pickpocket, you say? Hmm... Come to think of it, I did spot a strange woman running across the bridge over there a bit ago.${prompt};
She ran toward that gate, which would mean she could be at the Parade Grounds by now.${prompt};
A pickpocket? Hey, I wonder if you mean that lady running helter-skelter over there just now...${prompt};
A pickpocket? I did just see an undignified sort of woman just now. She was running toward Ranperre Gate.${prompt};
This part of town is so lively, I like watching everybody just go about their business.${prompt};
A pickpocket?${prompt};
Well, I did see a stranger. She ran for the gate over there just now.${prompt};
A pickpocket? Maybe it was that foul-mouthed woman just now. She called me a “spoony bard!” Unthinkable!${prompt};
Good day. I am Ulycille. Have you an interest in woodworking?${prompt};
San d'Orian woodworkers are blessed with an abundance of raw material, for our kingdom is surrounded by wooded hills.${prompt};
Should you look to refine your skill in woodworking, heed this counsel: San d'Oria is the perfect place to start!${prompt};
An adventurer, are you? This is one of the finest workshops in the land. Of course, much depends on you.${prompt};
Should you wish to refine your skill, craft the same thing over and over. Work hard, and you may become known among us.${prompt};
Say, have you heard?${prompt};
About the princes? Who has not? Things are getting worse, I hear!${prompt};
Yes, but I trust Prince Trion more than Prince Pieuje. He's the elder, and stronger, of the two.${prompt};
Oh, he's all brawn and no brains, unfit to decide the fate of our kingdom. I would follow Prince Pieuje, personally.${prompt};
Is it just me, or are there more strangers in town these days? Whatever could it mean?${prompt};
What, have you not heard? They are recruiting adventurers in droves!${prompt};
I hear they're taking any who will come--foreigners, even!${prompt};
Well, guess what happened to me. I was tidying the house yesterday, when a strange man walked in. He then ran out the veranda without even saying hello!${prompt};
Shame on those adventurers! At least they could knock before barging into our homes.${prompt};
Are you a new recruit? Hello, I am Matildie.${prompt};
You seem nice--much nicer than the other adventurers. Remember, ask for help if you lose your way!${prompt};
Why don't I give you a little money for your ${item-singular: 0[2]} there, just to get you started. Spend it wisely!${prompt};
Should you lose your way, just check your “Map” from the main menu.${prompt};
Farewell, and good luck to you!${prompt};
Goodbye!${prompt};
These sluice gates divide Northern San d'Oria into two parts: the Parade Grounds, and Laborman's Way.${prompt};
Laborman's Way is much lower than the rest of the city. So to prevent flooding, we use these sluice gates to adjust the water for the entire district!${prompt};
Wait, you're an adventurer, aren't you? I have a request, if you've the time...${prompt};
Don't tell anyone, but someone sent me a letter saying they poisoned the water here! We're looking into the veracity of that claim now.${prompt};
In the meantime, we must prepare a neutralizer to eliminate the poison. Might you be willing to obtain one?${prompt};
Go fetch the neutralizer?;
${selection-lines};
Let's do it.;
Not right now.${prompt};
That is good news, indeed! Now, all we need is someone versed in the ways of poison, but they're a hard lot to find...${prompt};
Oh, we can't just let innocent people die from poisoned water now, can we?${prompt};
It's no easy task, finding a neutralizer, is it? Few are skilled in the arts of poison, though that's a good thing, I suppose.${prompt};
You've got the neutralizer! But, the thing is...it turns out it was all just a hoax. But we'll reward you anyway.${prompt};
That's funny. I could have sworn she asked me to meet her here...${prompt};
He's late! I do hope he hasn't forgotten.${prompt};
Stars are more beautiful up close. Don't you agree?${prompt};
At night, the starry sky here is a sight to behold! If it weren't for all those chimneys, it'd be a finer sight still!${prompt};
Hello.${prompt};
Ah, good day. I am Morjean, a researcher here studying the rich past of our kingdom.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I'm not entirely certain, but perhaps I have heard a story about this thing you seek.${prompt};
In order to get ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, your hands must not be dry... I'm sure that's what I read. But it was so many years ago...${prompt};
That's all I know... I do hope it will be of some use to you.${prompt};

Hello there! Through my teachings I seek to raise the awareness of San d'Oria's fine citizens.${prompt};
My specialty is the elements and their correlations. Of course, those from abroad are welcome to my knowledge, too.${prompt};
View the chart of elemental correlations?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Ah...that is a shame. You've been taught all you need to know, have you?${prompt};
Excellent choice, friend. This may not be the best place for study, but let's get started!${prompt};
Ever heard of the elements, the most primal forms of energy? There are eight in all.${prompt};
Behold, they are like a wheel, with arrows forming a circle. This shows how the myriad elements relate to one another.${prompt};
They are like six serpents in a circle, each biting the tail of the one before it.${prompt};
I will explain simply. Water puts out fire, whilst the heat of fire melts ice.${prompt};
Ice blocks wind, whilst wind wears away at earth. Can you see it right there?${prompt};
Earth steals energy from lightning, whilst lightning throws its bolts into water.${prompt};
Light and darkness occupy the center. They are in mutual opposition, for one cannot be both at once.${prompt};
Ah, yes! There's one more thing you should know: the elements are tied closely to the status of your health.${prompt};
If you'd like to learn more, I am willing to continue.${prompt};
Are you ready to hear more?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, that will be enough.${prompt};
Very good! Fire causes disease, ice paralysis, wind silence, earth petrification, lightning stun, and water poison.${prompt};
Then there is charm, which is caused by light, whilst blindness, curse, and sleep are all the domain of darkness.${prompt};
Therefore, armor and accessories that resist certain elements also help you avoid status ailments caused by those elements.${prompt};
That will be all for today's lecture. Should you wish to review, just ask! I teach all who wish to learn.${prompt};
Welcome! San d'Oria Carpenters' Guild shop, at your service.${prompt};
San d'Oria Blacksmiths' Guild shop, at your service!${prompt};
Finding your way around Northern San d'Oria? Let me show you what's where!${prompt};
View his map?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
In the center lie the Parade Grounds and its fountain. Round them stand Chateau d'Oraguille, the San d'Oria Cathedral, and the consulates of our allies.${prompt};
Laborman's Way runs to the northwest. Down there you can find great centers of industry, like the Carpenters' Guild and the Blacksmiths' Guild.${prompt};
Fine, have it your way.${prompt};
I'm glad you brought a letter of introduction, but you haven't finished your duty to Consul Melek yet. You'll need to come back once that's out of the way.${prompt};
Nice letter of introduction you have there, but you've accepted a job from Consul Patt-Pott, right? Finish your work, then we'll talk! Ta-taru!${prompt};
I'll admit, you're one of my favorite recruits, so I've always had new missions for you. But I'm responsible for other adventurers, too!${prompt};
Henceforth I will check your rank points to determine whether you're ready for the next mission.${prompt};
The best way to earn rank points is to join the conquest and thereby obtain crystals.${prompt};
If you want to know more about the conquest, ask the lord knight at any gatehouse.${prompt};
You need to receive orders from Monarlais Halver in Chateau d'Oraguille for your mission to be deemed official.${prompt};
Before heading out for Ghelsba, be sure to receive orders from Monarlais Halver in Chateau d'Oraguille. Otherwise, your service won't be deemed official.${prompt};

Hello!${prompt};
Do you accept the mission?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
No, thanks.${prompt};
The Kingdom's influence is waning in Aragoneu. I cannot import goods from that region, though I long to.${prompt};
Would that Valdeaunia came again under San d'Orian dominion, I could then import its goods!${prompt};
I'd make a killing selling Fauregandi produce here, but that region's not under San d'Orian control!${prompt};
Once all of Li'Telor is back under San d'Orian influence, I'll fill my stock with unique goods from there!${prompt};
I'd be making a fortune selling goods from Qufim Island...if it were only under San d'Orian control!${prompt};
Have a look at these goods imported direct from Qufim Island!${prompt};
San d'Orian woodcraft is the finest in the land!${prompt};
Hello there! You're the one with the introduction, eh? I'm bizzy-wizzy right now. Perhaps you'd like to talk to one of the staff?${prompt};

I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.${prompt};
You've earned conquest points!${prompt};
You've received your nation's Signet.;
You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!${prompt};
I am ${name-npc}, a Temple Knight.;

${choice: 0}[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.];

I have some questions...;
Nothing, sorry to bother you.${prompt};
What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Conquests.;
Conquest results.;
Donating crystals.;
Conquest points.;
The effects of controlling regions.;
Regions controlled by other nations.;
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};
Where do you wish to take the supplies?;

We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations.;
Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.${prompt};
We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign.;
You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.${prompt};
Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race!;
Here is a small token of our appreciation.${prompt};
Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.${prompt};
You cannot currently purchase this item.;
Please choose another.${prompt};
Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.${prompt};
Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of ${number: 5} members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.${prompt};
Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.${prompt};
There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.${prompt};
Join the E.F. in ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?;

Join the E.F.;
Not this time.${prompt};
Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.${prompt};
One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.${prompt};
One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.${prompt};
One of your party members is below level ${number: 6}. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.${prompt};
I see that you are ready.;
I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.${prompt};
Are you ready to be teleported to ${choice: 7}[Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?

You received ${number: 1} conquest points!${prompt};
When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.${prompt};
I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties.;
Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.${prompt};
You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.${prompt};
The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.${prompt};
You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!${prompt};
Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.${prompt};
We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.${prompt};
Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.${prompt};
You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.${prompt};
Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.${prompt};
Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!${prompt};
Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.${prompt};
Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.${prompt};
Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.${prompt};
Your inventory is full. You could not accept the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.${prompt};

Hm? You want me to read this letter?${prompt};
My, what a predicament he has got himself into.${prompt};
I wondered why I had not seen much of my friend Rauteinot these days, but to think he was traveling around Kazham...${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 1[2]} that he has also sent... Very interesting, it is. It is perfect for carving a statue of the Goddess.${prompt};
With Rauteinot out in the wilderness risking his life for the cathedral, trying my hand at this statue is the least I could do.${prompt};
Then let us waste not time and carve a statue worthy of the Goddess.${prompt};
Patience! Patience! Even one such as I needs time to carve a statue worthy of Altana.${prompt};
Patience! Patience! Patience is what guided me to carve such a beautiful statue.${prompt};
However, I still cannot see how me making this sculpture can be of any assistance to my friend Rauteinot...${prompt};
Here. I entrust this statue to you.${prompt};
I know not whether you believe in the Goddess of the Dawn, but I trust you will handle her image carefully.${prompt};
I know not whether you believe in the Goddess of the Dawn, but I trust you will handle her image carefully.${prompt};
But how can carving some sculpture possibly help Rauteinot?${prompt};
Hmm... With magic, I could get hold of materials a mite easier. I'll have to check this “mart” out.${prompt};
A flyer? For me? Some reading material would be a welcome change of pace, indeed!${prompt};
Opening a shop of magic, without consulting me first? I must pay this Regine a visit!${prompt};
Magic could be of use on my journey to Paradise. Thank you so much!${prompt};
Your flyer is accepted!${prompt};
This person already has a flyer.${prompt};
F-Father... How could you!${prompt};
There's something foul in the air of late. Can you not feel it? I must get some charms to ward away this wickedness.${prompt};

Thank you! This should hold the darkness at bay...if only for a while. Bring more, if you can.${prompt};
There's a guard in the dungeon of Chateau d'Oraguille. Have you heard what they say of him?${prompt};
They say he's a vampire! He dwells there perhaps to hide from the light. And there's plenty of adventurers to suck fresh blood from!${prompt};
I have been eating ${item-plural: 0[2]} just to be safe. You don't think you could bring me ${number: 1}, could you? I'll pay!${prompt};

I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!${prompt};
We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt};
I watch over our friars on retreat. They journey to the hallowed white spires of every land, to bond with the essence of Altana.${prompt};
Ah, you have met Virnage? How does he fare? What's that? He wanted you to help restore the statue of the Goddess?${prompt};
Hah! He has much to learn! A true friar would have the Bastokers rediscover their faith on their own.${prompt};
But, you have helped...and for that we owe you thanks. I was going to give this to him... But here, I believe you are more deserving.${prompt};
May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt};
You saw Gantineux? Tell me, how does he fare? What is that? He's studying magic, you say?${prompt};
He has always had a penchant for research, but he relies too much on his head for answers. He must revere Altana with body and soul!${prompt};
I am sorry for any trouble he may have caused you. Please accept this as an apology.${prompt};
Ah, the intrepid ${name-player}. Word of your deeds has reached me. As such, I have a request to make of you...${prompt};
We friars journey to the hallowed spires of every land. There we touch the heart of Altana.${prompt};
There is word of a foul wind blowing upon the Crag of Dem in Konschtat Highlands. We believe it comes from Gusgen Mines.${prompt};
In elder days we put wandering spirits there to rest, sealing a pact of friendship with Bastok.${prompt};
We placed a seal there to keep the dead from waking, but it weakens. Here, take you this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
The seal was placed in a small hut deep within the mines. Attach the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} to strengthen it.${prompt};
That land is sacred to those who serve Altana. Should the evil winds persist, surely all of Vana'diel shall suffer.${prompt};
Please, you would be doing us a great service.${prompt};
You have returned! Word is that you strengthened the seal with the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} and protected that sacred land.${prompt};
Perhaps you feel no difference, but I can sense that the evil on the wind is greatly diminished.${prompt};
How now, Eperdur? Often do you fraternize with adventurers of late!${prompt};
Why, Prince Pieuje! How fares Your Highness?${prompt};
Save the formalities. What did you ask of this adventurer?${prompt};
Your Highness, an evil wind blew forth out from the mines of Gusgen. To seal it off at the source, I prepared ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
I see... But should not such things be left to Bastok? I see no need for our clergy to--${prompt};
It was by order of the papsque, my prince. Bring Altana's blessing to every land, so that Paradise may open its gates to all... So bade His Holiness.${prompt};
I see. Papsque Shamonde speaks wisdom, as always. Her blessing to every land, indeed...${prompt};
Farewell. May Paradise open its gates to us both.${prompt};
May it so, Your Highness. Oh, and I must give my thanks to you, my child.${prompt};
Here, take this. Normally it is given only to the most reverent of friars. You have earned it.${prompt};
You have performed great services for us in the past. Now even greater peril draws nigh.${prompt};
In order to extend our influence north, Prince Pieuje has ordered us to research more potent spells of white magic.${prompt};
Thanks to Chief Cid of Bastok and his research of the Crystal Lines, we have established a new Telepoint in the Northlands.${prompt};
We have made many copies of a certain scroll of white magic, but it seems we have lost the original.${prompt};
Without it, we cannot create more copies. We believe that the original was brought out of Fei'Yin long ago.${prompt};
In the days of the ancients such scrolls were common, so perhaps another can be found there.${prompt};
Please, do what you can to locate ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Huzzah! You found ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. This is fine news, indeed.${prompt};
"I should inform you, though... The scroll was not lost; it was destroyed by one of the excommunicated.${prompt}";
He apparently harbored hatred against San d'Oria and her clergy. Truly lamentable...${prompt};
At any rate, my friend, you deserve your just reward: a scroll of white magic, upon which is inscribed a new spell. Without your help, we could never have deciphered it.${prompt};
Have you come to pray, my child? First fetch ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You will be judged by your actions, not words.${prompt};
Excellent. Now, pray to her. May she show you the way to Paradise.${prompt};
Curilla? Is that you?${prompt};
Are you all right?${prompt};
You are awake, at last! I am much relieved. Once you began to pray, you seemed...anguished.${prompt};
Who knows what they would say if you suddenly collapsed here? We are fortunate that you are well!${prompt};
Wait, what have you there? Plated boots of some sort. You had them not when came you hither...${prompt};
What is all this?${prompt};
Why, Your Holiness!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Hmm, what business has this illustrious adventurer here?${prompt};
What? You saw a ghost of a red mage--of Rainemard?${prompt};
You say it is not a dream, that the dead give away boots? This is evil you speak!${prompt};
Those boots! The spirit of Rainemard gave you them?${prompt};
Hmm... No, it cannot be! Tell me, who bade you come and utter this blasphemy?${prompt};
I will not be fooled so easily! Pray to Altana and beg for forgiveness!${prompt};
You have angered His Holiness! You had best leave, and reflect upon your trespasses!${prompt};
Come not hither again! Understood?${prompt};
A ghost of a red mage is in the church!${prompt};
The enemy is here! Knights, to arms!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Father!${prompt};
Wait, Curilla! Be not deceived! That is no father of yours!${prompt};
Curilla!?${prompt};
Stop, Curilla!${prompt};
Prince Trion!${prompt};
Knights, stand down!${prompt};
Curilla, drop your sword.${prompt};
I will not be defeated...${prompt};
Argh!${prompt};
Curilla!${prompt};
But I am not afraid of defeat.${prompt};
Look out!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Ulp!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
By a hair's breadth I made it in time. Curilla, forgive me for exposing you to this danger.${prompt};
Father...${prompt};
A true warrior does not shrink from defeat. My only regret was not teaching that to you.${prompt};
But it seems that you have already learned, Curilla. My, how you have grown!${prompt};
Watch over her, Prince.${prompt};
You have my word.${prompt};
Long have I troubled you. When I appeared here, a minion of the dark followed me. For that I am sorry.${prompt};
This will not fully expiate my sins, but perhaps you may find some use for it. Please accept it.${prompt};
And keep a watchful eye on this church. It is a pity I can say nothing more.${prompt};
Curilla, I am relieved to see you standing tall. Though we shall never meet again, I want you to remember...${prompt};
You will always be my daughter. And I will always watch over you.${prompt};
I should return this watch. Carry it in memory of me.${prompt};
Now, I must go... Farewell, my daughter!${prompt};
Father!${prompt};
I'll always be your daughter.${prompt};
Your inventory is full. Speak to Curilla for your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The prrretty yellow rocks go round and round,;
Round and round, meow meow meow.♪${prompt};
I want a rrrock that's nice and round,;
And a little yellow.♪${prompt};
I wish that all of San d'Oria was full of pretty flowerrrs...${prompt};
...I wonder if everrrybody knows about garrrdening.${prompt};
(Nobody knows the way to a girrrl's heart anymorrre...)${prompt};
(Now, if only somebody came along with one of those rrred beauties...)${prompt};
This is sooo cute...but members of the Star Onion Brrrigade are supposed to do only good deeds...but this is sooo cute.${prompt};
Meooow...;
Wouldn't it be grrreat if my whole house was made of flowerrrs?${prompt};

Reooow? You'rrre giving this to me?${prompt};
Meooow... But this...meooow...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks a little confused.;
I only like prrretty flowerrrs and prrretty rocks. Don't need anything else.${prompt};
Prrretty yellow rocks! That's what I'm collecting!${prompt};
Wow! What a prrretty flowerrr! It smells sooo good!${prompt};
Wow! What a prrretty rock! It's sooo smooth!${prompt};
${number: 3}! I'm sooo happy! Purrrrrr...${prompt};
Now my room will be full of prrretty rocks and flowerrrs! Heh heh!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc}looks very happy.;
Now, all my collection needs is ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt};
Anyway, thanks, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/miss]♪${prompt};
Meooow! This is the one! This is the one!${prompt};
This is the one I've wanted forrr my collection!${prompt};
This one is grrreat, too! You got all these forrr me?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks really happy.;
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks really, REALLY happy.;
You're the grrreatest!!${prompt};
I can't give you anything in returrrn, but I can tell you my secrrret!${prompt};
Come closerrr...${prompt};
(Meow meow meow meow...)${prompt};
(Meow meow meow meow...)${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You have learned your way through the back alleys of Jeuno! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.${prompt};
Heh-heh...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks extremely happy.;
Don't tell anybody I told you that! It'll be our little secrrret!${prompt};
Wow! Thanks! My house is filled with prrretty flowers!${prompt};
Wow! More yellow rocks! My house gets prrrettier every day!${prompt};
But my moogle, my moogle is rrreally upset. She says we don't have any more space in my house!${prompt};
“You have no more room, kupo!”;
Reooow... Give me a brrreak!${prompt};
So, you can have that back!;
I guess I'll just have to give up on it this time. (Sigh)${prompt};
Hee-hee.;
${choice-player-gender}[Misterrr/Miss], I don't need this.${prompt};
I'd like to keep it, too, but I'm already out of space in my room...${prompt};
Meow? Is this for me?${prompt};
I'm happy, but...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks a little confused.;
But what I rrreally want is a prrretty flower to put in my vase at home...${prompt};
Thanks for the offerrr, though, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/miss].${prompt};
Meow? A prrresent for me?;
Wow! Purrrrrrr...${prompt};
${number: 3} prrretty flowerrrs for me? These will look grrreat in my room!${prompt};
With all these, I won't have to pick any flowerrrs here for my rrroom.${prompt};
I looove all kinds of flowerrrs. Especially prrretty ${item-plural: 3[2]}!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks very happy.;
Thank you, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/miss]!${prompt};

This is my favorrrite flowerrr in the whole wide worrrld!;
Purrrrrrr...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks very, VERY happy.;
OK! I'll let you in on a little secrrret...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} starts whispering something in your ear.;
(But you have to prrromise not to tell anybody...)${prompt};
（Whisper...meow...whisper)${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You have learned your way through the back alleys of Windurst! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.${prompt};
Heh-heh... Pretty cool, huh?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks pleased with herself.;
Don't forrrget, you prrromised not to tell anybody! Not even the other memberrrs of the Star Onion Brigade!${prompt};
This is just between you and me!${prompt};
Thank you♪ Thank you♪ Thank you♪${prompt};
Thank you for all the prrretty flowerrrs!♪${prompt};
But I've rrrun out of vases to put them in! You can have this back.${prompt};
It's a prrresent from me to you!${prompt};
Flowerrrs...purrrrrr...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} can't take her eyes off the flowers in front of her, and pays no attention to your gift.;
Meow? For me?${prompt};
...${prompt};
You, you, you...${prompt};
You can't move the hearrrt of a lady with junk like this!;
You'll need something more--more exciting, more excellent, more extrrravagant! Something like flowerrrs...${prompt};
There aren't many people who can imprrress me.${prompt};
Herrre. I don't need this, ${choice-player-gender}[misterrr/miss].${prompt};
How beautiful! You really know the way to a lady's hearrrt.${prompt};
But this is just the basics. You've still got a ways to imprrress me!${prompt};
This tiny bouquet is cute, but you're still far from imprrressing me!${prompt};
And a full bouquet! You're starting to catch on, but anyone can brrring me this.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} smiles slyly at you.;
If you really want to melt a girls' hearrrt, you should trrry ${item-plural: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Well, thanks anyway for the flowerrrs! La la la la la♪${prompt};
What's this...;
...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} looks very happy!;
This is it! The colorrr! The shape! The frrragrance! Purrrrr...${prompt};
I have to admit it. You rrreally know how to imprrress a girl.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} checks the area before approaching you.;

${color-alt: 121}You have learned your way through the back alleys of Bastok! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.${prompt};
<Giggle> Thank you!${prompt};
You've rrreally touched my hearrrt.♪${prompt};
Another one! You know that this is my favorrrite! Thank you!♪${prompt};
Meow? Did you already forrrget the way to a girrrl's heart?${prompt};
If I took all the norrrmal gifts I got from my fans, I wouldn't have any room for the rrreally nice gifts.${prompt};
You can have this back!${prompt};
It's tough being adorrred by hundrrreds, but I guess I'll have to get used to it.${prompt};
You can have this flowerrr back.${prompt};
Meow? What's this?${prompt};
For me? Hmm...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-npc} does not look that excited.;
I'd rather have a flowerrr like the one in Queen Leaute's garrrden.${prompt};
Here, you can have this back.${prompt};
A flowerrr, for me? I have to show this to Mister Chalvatot!${prompt};
You know--you know--Mister Chalvatot is always rrreally happy when I bring him flowerrrs.♪${prompt};
This little bouquet is just like the lovely bunch of flowers Mister Chalvatot gathered for me one time! Thank you so much!${prompt};
Someday--someday--I'm gonna be just like Princess Claidie! Chalvatot said if I take rrreal good care of my flowerrrs that I could!${prompt};
I'm gonna take these and plant them all around San d'Orrria! Thank you!!${prompt};
If I only had ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}...${prompt};
If I ever get ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, I'm gonna plant it in Queen Leaute's garden!♪${prompt};
Meooow! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}! For me? Yeah!${prompt};
Now--Now Queen Leaute's garden will be prrrettier than ever!${prompt};

You've been so nice. I wanna give you something to say thanks...${prompt};

You are returning it to me? Why, thank you! Now I can go fishing with my friends!${prompt};
But please do not pity my father. He is kind sometimes.${prompt};
Oh, when will my father take me fishing...${prompt};
Thank you for the fishing rod! By the way, there is something else I wish to ask of you.${prompt};
Would you please do me this favor?${prompt};
I need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Ordelle's Caves. I must have it in order to sharpen a certain sword.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do my best.;
I can't right now.${prompt};
Wonderful! I wish I could tell you where it could be found. Try asking someone who often sharpens blades.${prompt};
That is all right. I have troubled you enough. Perhaps I will ask someone else.${prompt};
I wish I could tell you where ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is inside the caves. Try asking someone who often sharpens blades.${prompt};
Thank you. Here, this is for you. I snatched it from my father's chest. He won't notice if one goes missing. And besides, I'll be sharpening this blade for him!${prompt};
Good day. You are becoming quite a knight!${prompt};
Hello, Ailbeche. How fare you?${prompt};
Why, hello, Vilbert!${prompt};
You've returned from smiting Orcs, haven't you? Please, tell me of your adventures!${prompt};
I am sorry, Ailbeche. First I must rest, for I am weary. And who is this? You seem to be a knight, like me.${prompt};
Yes. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] went to great lengths to help me while you were away.${prompt};
Is that so?${prompt};
Many apologies! I am Vilbert, substitute to Captain Exoroche of the Royal Knights. Allow me to express my thanks for watching over Ailbeche.${prompt};
Vilbert is in the same division as my father.${prompt};
Since Captain Exoroche has fallen ill, I was given temporary command of his division.${prompt};
Strange, that is... My father is well.${prompt};
At any rate, Vilbert is a great swordsman. He last won second place at the tournament!${prompt};
Well, I attribute that to luck, nothing more.${prompt};
Hey!${prompt};
Greetings, Zarnei-Hamnei. What is it?${prompt};
I hear you got yourself a fishing rod! Now we'll take you with us to fish for the big one!${prompt};
Truly? I begged a thousand times, yet always the answer was no.${prompt};
Yeah, of course. On one condition...${prompt};
Condition?${prompt};
Yeah. You have to bring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
What? You ask the impossible! How is a child like me supposed to catch ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, duh. Just ask your dad. He's a captain of the Royal Knights, after all.${prompt};
I don't know...${prompt};
Well, see you later! You'd better have it when I come back or I'm not gonna take you!${prompt};
Is the big one really that big?${prompt};
Of course! They say he often swallows pieces of treasure. We won't stop until he is ours!${prompt};
But therein lies a secret. We'll never tell where he bites, lest others catch him first!${prompt};
Well, the legends speak of a brave knight who once slew a great fish, and gained the treasure it had consumed. Ailbeche, you should ask your father for help with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, yes. You are right. I shall ask him.${prompt};
Right. Well, I must go report to Prince Trion, then. Ailbeche, I shall see you again once I am rested.${prompt};
It was an honor to meet you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]. Farewell.${prompt};
Wow, someday I wish to be a knight like him!${prompt};
Say, you are a knight, aren't you? Do you not want to catch the great fish of legend for its treasure?${prompt};
Want to catch the big one?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do it.;
Not right now.${prompt};
That's a fine knight! First we will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to get started. I doubt my father would give one up if we asked.${prompt};
What? How can you say that without even trying? After all, your opponent is a mere fish...${prompt};
Oh, how I wish that Father was more like Vilbert. He wouldn't give one up, even if I asked.${prompt};
Oh, I knew he would say no. Long ago, Father was not like this.${prompt};
You see, my mother was killed by Orcs. My father was there, but he couldn't save her.${prompt};
He blamed her death on the quality of his armor and weapons. He gave up practicing swordsmanship every morning, and spends all his time scouring the shops for equipment.${prompt};
He is needed in the expeditions, but always he declines due to a supposed sickness or insufficiencies in equipment. I fear he will lose his rank as captain.${prompt};
I am sure a knight of my father's stature could soon get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. How can I go fishing now?${prompt};
Oh, ${item-plural: 0[2]} can only be found in the Crawlers' Nest. And such a quest is beyond me! I wonder how I could get one...${prompt};
What? This is for me? You always give me things. Are you sure you do not want to use it to go fishing yourself, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam]?${prompt};
Hey, Ailbeche!${prompt};
You got ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, right? If not, you ain't coming with me!${prompt};
Oh, actually, no...${prompt};
I could not find any...${prompt};
What? Your old man didn't get any for you, huh? He's not really a captain, is he? Forget it, I'm not taking you anywhere!${prompt};
It's always like this.${prompt};
I will never get there, so let me tell you where you can fish for the big one. They say he's in Castle Oztroja.${prompt};
If you take a renowned fisherman with you, then you should offer him something. At the very least, you should give five ${item-plural: 0[2]} or so.${prompt};
But if you are to fish for him yourself, you should catch him easily, as long as you've had a little practice. After all, fishing is all about patience!${prompt};
If you do catch the big one, watch out! They say he's one feisty fish. Your skills in swordsmanship will be of greater use than those of fishing, I gather.${prompt};
I have uncovered all of this, yet I cannot go myself. Please, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam], catch him in my stead!${prompt};
They say that you can catch the big one in Castle Oztroja. It would be foul if someone caught him before you!${prompt};
What? You caught the big one? Amazing! I doubt I could have done the same.${prompt};
Now, hurry and get it cleaned! I have heard of an expert fisherman in Selbina. You should find him and ask him!${prompt};
Wow! Such a thing was inside its gizzard? Surely I would never have caught him, for he gave even you a run for your money.${prompt};
Father, how could you forget this sword?${prompt};
What? Vilbert is in league with the Orcs? Hah! What nonsense!${prompt};
I will not fall for such a joke so easily. Vilbert is taking me fishing in Jugner Forest. Be not surprised if I catch a bigger fish than the big one!${prompt};
You saw, did you not? My father is a mighty knight! I wish to become like him!${prompt};
Father promised to take me fishing! But I know that he is a much greater swordsman than a fisher.${prompt};
Now I shall prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that you gave me.${prompt};
Behold the beauty of this cathedral. We failed to protect it once, but never again.${prompt};
Narcheral, I bring news!${prompt};
What!? Are you certain?${prompt};
Yes.${prompt};
They are massing by the hundreds!? I-Impossible!${prompt};
At any rate, you must return and continue the investigation.${prompt};
Adventurer, I have a request. Depart at once for the western borders of Valkurm Dunes. Find the messenger of the dark stalkers there, but only at night.${prompt};
Defeat the dark stalker and take its ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
If the reports are correct, the dead of Tavnazia are returning. This is dire news, indeed!${prompt};
Yes, this is indeed ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Our worst nightmare has come true.${prompt};
This is for you. I foresee I will need your help yet again...${prompt};
Excellent work, my friend. This is what I promised. We can only await Prince Pieuje's decision now.${prompt};
Why, I heard an adventurer smote Marquis Altedour, but to think it was you!${prompt};
Prince Pieuje disappoints me for his failure to act. I would have suggested that he claim credit for the defeat of the marquis.${prompt};
I saw in him a more luminous mind. I suppose royalty will never know how secure one's position is in society.${prompt};
Oh, please disregard my musings. You have done us a great service, and for that you should be rewarded.${prompt};
Say, are you an adventurer?${prompt};
My name is Rochefogne, and I am an adventurer, too. I have just arrived at San d'Oria...${prompt};
And already I am struck at how little has changed! Time has no dominion over this city.${prompt};
Can you see the great cathedral yonder? Faithful San d'Orians gather there still in worship to the Goddess of the Dawn.${prompt};
And behold its balcony! Could the papsque still rise there to grant benedictions?${prompt};
Hmm? And they must be Royal Knights...${prompt};
Swiftly do they return to Chateau d'Oraguille, surely from some expedition abroad...${prompt};
You, too, must learn the difference between the Temple Knights and the Royal Knights, if you are to bear San d'Orian citizenship!${prompt};
The Temple Knights shield the capital, while the Royal Knights strike at our foes!${prompt};
I heard mention in my travels that Prince Trion had assumed control of the Royal Knights.${prompt};
Yes, Trion... Of him I have heard naught for ages. I do hope the princes are well.${prompt};
And Princess Claidie! Fair is said to be the younger sister of Trion and Pieuje. Perhaps someday I may meet her!${prompt};
But, I ramble. Many pardons!${prompt};
So long have I been away that my head races. Please, let me hear your questions.${prompt};
What would you ask?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing in particular.;
I want to go outside and fight.;
I want to shop.;
I want to know about adventuring.${prompt};
Should you wish to leave the city from here in Northern San d'Oria, you must pass through Ranperre Gate to the west.${prompt};
You surely must have a map of this city, but hear my directions anyway.${prompt};
First, walk west from the Parade Grounds upon which we now stand.${prompt};
Pass through the gate, and follow the road past the furniture shop and the inn.${prompt};
Take the gate on your left, and make another left down the stairs. Soon Ranperre Gate will rise before you.${prompt};
Shopping? Well, at the auction houses and bazaar are goods from other adventurers. But let me tell you of the shops I frequent.${prompt};
For weaponry, ask at the weapon shop in the northwest corner of Northern San d'Oria. Upon your map is written a sword. That is the place.${prompt};
For armor, walk south into Southern San d'Oria. Check your map for the shop marked with a shirt of mail.${prompt};
If you seek magic, go northwest. Near the Carpenters' Guild is the gate that opens to Port San d'Oria. Look for a scroll on your map to find the magic shop.${prompt};
For money, townsfolk may give you a reward for helping them. You could also hunt monsters and sell the bounty to merchants in town.${prompt};
Spoken like an adventurer! What do you seek to know?${prompt};
What do you seek to know?;
${selection-lines};
Helping people.;
Hunting monsters.;
Easy money.;
Finding work.${prompt};
Helping people, eh? Come to think of it, I saw a lady pacing back and forth before a house in Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
Perhaps you could help her. She should still be there on Pikeman's Way.${prompt};
Walk through Victory Arch behind you to enter Southern San d'Oria. Then, open your map and find the way.${prompt};
You seem confident of yourself. I am much relieved.${prompt};
Come to think of it, a merchant outside the Tanners' Guild in Southern San d'Oria asked me to gather some hides.${prompt};
Maybe you could instead? Walk through Victory Arch behind you to enter Southern San d'Oria. Then, head west to reach the Tanners' Guild.${prompt};
New weapons and armor can cost a fortune.${prompt};
But, hmm... Ah, yes. I recommend you see the woodworkers on Laborman's Way. They might have something for you.${prompt};
Laborman's Way lies north-west of us. Pass the furniture shop and the inn, and take the gate on the right. Laborman's Way opens beneath it.${prompt};
To further San d'Oria's glory, you should undertake missions given from the gatehouses.${prompt};
They do not pay, but you can earn rank points as proof of your contributions to our kingdom.${prompt};
With enough rank points, your rank will rise.${prompt};
And with higher rank comes greater opportunity. Those of high rank are granted tasks that decide the fate of the Kingdom!${prompt};
Now, you'd best be on your way. Adventure proudly for San d'Oria, and your ${choice: 6}[sword/sword/fists/staff/staff/sword/blade] shall never falter!${prompt};
Do you follow? Adventure proudly for San d'Oria, and your ${choice: 6}[sword/sword/fists/staff/staff/sword/blade] shall never falter!${prompt};
Is that so? Well, adventure proudly for San d'Oria, and your ${choice: 6}[sword/sword/fists/staff/staff/sword/blade] shall never falter!${prompt};
Oh, before I forget... I give you this for your journeys. Show it to Matildie, who stands before the drawbridge to Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
However, know you of our tradition regarding the bequeathal of objects? Ere giving to others, we open the main menu and select “Trade.”${prompt};
Do not hesitate to ask other adventurers for help.${prompt};
Now, I must go and seek entrance to the castle. May we meet again, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Oh, an adventurer. If you are here for the sermon on the Gates of Paradise, beseech the friar standing at the narthex.${prompt};
You say you came on behalf of the Temple Knights? And you want to know about Tedimout?${prompt};
Why, may Altana bless thee! Yes, Tedimout was a friar in training.${prompt};
Oft would he enter the woods of Ronfaure, in search of wild herbs for the making of tea and medicines.${prompt};
Ever did I warn him against going alone, for the trees can hide predators...and worse!${prompt};
He claimed that the blue robes of the clergy would protect him.${prompt};
But it seems his faith was ill-placed. I fear that Orcs took him!${prompt};
The horror he must be facing now... Each morning and night I pray to the Goddess of the Dawn to deliver him from their clutches!${prompt};
Why, Prince Pieuje! And, Papsque Shamonde!${prompt};
Vicasque Arnau, I've come to talk to you about the missing acolyte. It seems his disappearance may not have been the Orcs' doing after all.${prompt};
That is correct, Your Highness. I hear that Tedimout sometimes went into the forest to look for herbs.${prompt};
Let us not jump to conclusions. Perhaps Tedimout set out on his own...for an extended hike, for example! Temple Knights are sent out only in special cases. First we must know more!${prompt};
You speak the truth, Your Holiness. The citadel cannot be emptied of Temple Knights for so uncertain a cause.${prompt};
I understand, of course. However... If it were true that Tedimout did happen to be kidnapped by Orcs, surely we could not simply let him die?${prompt};
No, of course not. I have decided to send an adventurer. If ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] finds that Orcs do hold the boy, then the Temple Knights will be there to claim him.${prompt};
I understand, Your Highness. I am very thankful.${prompt};
By the way, who have you been talking with?${prompt};
Your Highness, ${name-player} is here on errand from the knight at the gatehouse. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] came to ask about Tedimout.${prompt};
Well, that's perfect. I shall order you to undertake this mission.${prompt};
Infiltrate Ghelsba, and determine whether they hold this Tedimout captive. I've heard they keep prisoners in a small hut somewhere.${prompt};
Once you know, notify a Temple Knight. Now, go!${prompt};
You have my eternal thanks for saving Tedimout!${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
All I can do is pray for adventurers. Please, let me pray for you, too.${prompt};
May light shine upon thy path, and may the Gates of Paradise open to you!${prompt};
So, Tedimout has returned... Confound that meddling adventurer!${prompt};
We can negotiate with the Orcs once we know what they want, but I loathe the prospect of sending Temple Knights to scout.${prompt};
That hotheaded brother of yours refuses to think pragmatically. Our research through the centuries proves that the Gates of Paradise will soon open forth!${prompt};
And still his ears are deaf to us! Your Highness, I fear we may fall behind the other nations.${prompt};
I understand. We must first find what the Orcs know of Paradise's gates.${prompt};
Bold have they become of late. Some say their arm has reached as far as the Tomb of King Ranperre and Ordelle's Caves.${prompt};
Hm? Is someone there?${prompt};
How dare you! Eavesdropping on the papsque as he entertains the prince!${prompt};
No, it is all right, Your Holiness.${prompt};
You came to deliver the report, yes? Well, let us see it.${prompt};
So... The Orcs are searching for something. What it is we cannot say. This requires further delving.${prompt};
Hmph.${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}. I will inform the gatehouse knight that your mission is complete.${prompt};
Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt};
For one so new, I'd be... Hmm?${prompt};
Lord knight, forgive this interruption, but there is something I must ask of you.${prompt};
I question whether Queen Leaute truly passed away fifteen years past. Tell me, of what cause did she die?${prompt};
Who are you, and why do you pry with such inquiries?${prompt};
Please, I have traveled from afar to see Her Highness!${prompt};
You've what!?${prompt};
Very well. Listen closely. Fifteen years ago, Queen Leaute fell to a rare sickness. She left this world before we could save her.${prompt};
Ah, so an illness claimed her life.${prompt};
Well, it's none of your concern at any rate. Even if she lived, an adventurer like you could never see her, much less the inside of Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt};
Er...${prompt};
What was the name of her illness?${prompt};
We are not told such things. Only the royal family would know.${prompt};
Is that so? Well, I thank you for your kindness, proud knight of San d'Oria.${prompt};
Hey, wait!${prompt};
What was the matter with that adventurer? He was awfully stubborn, wasn't he?${prompt};
He seemed to know the late queen personally, but how could he not be aware of her death?${prompt};
At any rate, your work is done. Excellent form, my friend!${prompt};
What, you want the mission from rank one again?${prompt};
I knew you'd return safely, and with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission completed!${prompt};
Have you ever set foot into King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt};
Two hundred years ago, the curtain fell on the golden age of San d'Oria. Civil war erupted over the Kingdom's hegemony.${prompt};
King Ranperre was there to extinguish the conflict. When he died he was interred in a great tomb south of East Ronfaure.${prompt};
But unknown hands have defiled his grave of late.${prompt};
Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Ravaging a royal tomb is an unforgivable crime!${prompt};
Your orders are to investigate the tomb and determine if there is any truth to what they say. Do you understand?${prompt};
Accept the mission?;
${selection-lines};
I accept.;
I do not accept.${prompt};
I implore you to make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt};
But wander too deeply within, and Goblins might find you. Tread boldly, my friend, but do not go in over your head!${prompt};
Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Scour the tomb and determine if they speak the truth.${prompt};
Make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt};
Have you really searched the tomb?${prompt};
So, you got this from bats in King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt};
You see, this actually belonged to an Orc. What could Orcs want with the tomb?${prompt};
At any rate, your mission is over. Speak not a word of this to another.${prompt};
Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt};
I know you came all this way, but I can't help you right now.${prompt};
Oh, who am I fooling? Of course I could use your help!${prompt};
Have you not heard? Orcs came and kidnapped some children! We think they're keeping them at their lair in Ghelsba.${prompt};
Why, not long ago came ill news from the cathedral. A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt};
The Royal Knights would march to his rescue, but Prince Trion is away in the north, and cannot give the order.${prompt};
Prince Pieuje is in earnest deliberations over whether to send Temple Knights instead. It seems his efforts are focused upon saving the children, but...${prompt};
But no matter. We need knowledge of the enemy. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt};
A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt};
The Temple Knights may be mobilized soon. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt};
Prince Trion just informed me of your handiwork. You've done beautifully.${prompt};
Due to your exemplary contribution, ${name-player}, San d'Oria hereby recognizes you as an adventurer of rank two.${prompt};
But do not let it go to your head. This certificate is valid only in San d'Oria.${prompt};
Work hard and better things will come, my friend. Someday your name will be known to our allies as well.${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing. The vicasque of the cathedral said he wants to thank you on behalf of the boy.${prompt};
You achieve rank two.${prompt};
At any rate, you completed the mission well enough. Time for a reward!${prompt};
I award you with rank points commensurate with your achievement.${prompt};
Prince Trion ordered scouts from the Royal Knights to Davoi, while Prince Pieuje ordered scouts from the Temple Knights. It's like the right hand knows not what the left is doing!${prompt};
Monarlais Halver is furious, but first he needs knowledge. You must find the scout from the Temple Knights, receive his scouting report, and return that report to the monarlais.${prompt};
What? You were told to hand the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} to Prince Pieuje personally?${prompt};
Well, you should find His Highness in the cathedral.${prompt};
You've come just at the right time! Prince Trion wants a word with you. It seems he heard of you when you received your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Head to the chambers of Prince Trion inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt};
Prince Trion has called for you. Head to his chamber inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt};
I know not what Prince Trion wanted you to do, but see it through to the end! Understand?${prompt};
"Hello there. Now's not the time for missions; Chateau d'Oraguille has been visited by bandits!${prompt}";
You must make haste to Chateau d'Oraguille! Find Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt};
Bandits infiltrating Chateau d'Oraguille is unprecedented in history! Make haste and see Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt};
Oh, I want my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
<Phssshooooowoooo>;
You never see Goblinshhh from underworld? Me no bad. Me sell chipshhh. You buy. Use with shhhtone heart. You get lucky!${prompt};
I've been trying to import goods from Vollbow, but it's so hard to get items from areas that aren't under San d'Orian control.${prompt};
What is this? You wish to learn of dragons? If only Doctor Oiheaurese were...${prompt};
...here!${prompt};
Doctor, this adventurer is inquiring about dragons.${prompt};
Well, then our adventurer has come to the right place. First of all, young ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lass], you must understand that where there are holy dragons, there exist dragons of evil as well.${prompt};
Why, Sir Rahal. What gives us the honor of your presence here today?${prompt};
Nothing urgent, Doctor. I was just wondering if anything peculiar--any suspicious characters--had been spotted in this area recently.${prompt};
No...nothing out of the ordinary, sir.${prompt};
I see... I just thought that...maybe the body of...his body was...no...${prompt};
Carry on.${prompt};
Ahem! Now that he is out of the way, where was I?${prompt};
Ah, yes. As I was saying, recently there has been a large drop in the number of dragons born in Vana'diel.${prompt};
That is where you come in. There is a rumor that a wyvern has laid an egg in the Maze of Shakhrami.${prompt};
I would like you to excavate the egg and protect it from the dragonslayers.${prompt};
To prevent them from killing the wyvern while it is still young, we must get to the egg before they do.${prompt};
Doctor Oiheaurese said that a wyvern egg has been laid deep in the Maze of Shakhrami. Could this be true?${prompt};
Ah, it is you.;
I am sorry to inform you that Doctor Oiheaurese is not available at the moment. Perhaps he has taken ill. His work keeps him up late into the evening.${prompt};
Do you have business with the doctor? Well, he is currently away from the cathedral.${prompt};
And who might you be? I have not seen you around here before.${prompt};
My name is Yachemidot. I am what you would call a student of Doctor Oiheaurese.${prompt};
That egg? Is that really from a wyvern?${prompt};
How would you like to try hatching that egg? The doctor has told me that it would be dangerous, but I would like to give it a try. Any true scientist would feel the same way.${prompt};
And I just happen to know how to do it. Are you willing to help? You want to see it hatch too, don't you?${prompt};
Take part in Yachemidot's plan?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Wonderful! Take the egg and place it on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine located in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};
It's not that difficult! All you have to do is take the egg and place it on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine, which is located in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};
If that wyvern has the holy crest, then there's a possibility that a new dragoon may be born!${prompt};
I've never heard the Doctor mention any Yachemidot. And what is all this with placing the egg on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine in the Meriphataud Mountains?${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. You have come.;
The royal family requests your assistance.${prompt};
I can assume you have heard of the late King Ranperre's Lightbringer. If that sword were to fall into Orcish hands, San d'Oria would have her back against the wall.${prompt};
This situation must be prevented at any cost.${prompt};
We have Temple Knights participating in the search efforts, but there is an obvious lack of manpower.${prompt};
Our scholars have been combing through the ancient San d'Orian text you retrieved, searching for any new clues.${prompt};
I am confident they will find something.${prompt};
If only the cathedral's library had survived the fires of the Great War, we would not be so behind in our research on Lightbringer.${prompt};
Your Holiness!${prompt};
I apologize. You have a visitor...${prompt};
Mind you not. What is it, Morjean?${prompt};
Yes, Your Holiness. During the search of the library, we came across an ancient parchment hidden inside another book. Until now, we had passed it off as a poem written by someone long ago.${prompt};
However, after deciphering it, we realized it was a message reporting something hidden deep within the Bostaunieux Oubliette during the Great War.${prompt};
What? Could it be the holy sword, Lightbringer?${prompt};
We were unable to tell from the content of the parchment, but the fact remains that this item was hidden for a reason.${prompt};
Thank you for the update. You may leave now.${prompt};
We must report these new findings to the king immediately. This may shed some light on the whereabouts of Lightbringer.${prompt};
Prince Pieuje, what if we were to send ${name-player} to investigate?${prompt};
${name-player} was the first to find the true resting place of King Ranperre, and has the trust of King Destin. I feel a preliminary search of the area is necessary before a full-scale survey is carried out. ${prompt};
Prince Pieuje! You must act before Prince Trion. Have you already forgotten the incident at King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt};
I understand your words, Your Holiness, but I feel it is my duty to first report these new findings to my father.${prompt};
Your Holiness.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
${name-player}, will you journey into the Bostaunieux Oubliette and investigate the findings?${prompt};
On the outside, the prince may deny it, but on the inside, he is counting on your success in this mission.${prompt};
According to the newly deciphered parchment, scientists hid “something” down in the Bostaunieux Oubliette during the time of war. I want you to journey down there and find that something.${prompt};
I see... So you did not find Lightbringer. But what you have found is truly a possession of the lost Dragon King.${prompt};
Your Holiness, the Royal Knights sent to investigate the Bostaunieux Oubliette have returned. Their search turned up nothing.${prompt};
What is that!?${prompt};
Prince Pieuje, ${name-player} retrieved this stone tablet from deep within the oubliette.${prompt};
When the great King Ranperre brought the chaos in San d'Oria under control, it is said that his admonition was carved in stone.${prompt};
This may be that very tablet, my prince.${prompt};
I was correct in assuming that the Royal Knights would not be suited for a task such as this--one that requires perseverance.${prompt};
However, we cannot be sure that this tablet is King Ranperre's...${prompt};
Absolutely. There is still much deciphering that must be carried out by our scholars. It will require much more time.${prompt};
However, I promise you that I will make this task our top priority.${prompt};
As for the report on our finding of the tablet, I shall take the matter up with the king myself.${prompt};
And as for you, ${name-player}. Once the deciphering has been completed, we may have another task for you.${prompt};
Good day.${prompt};
You say you were under orders from the papsque? I am sorry for all the trouble he may have caused you.${prompt};
When it comes to the subject of Lightbringer, the papsque becomes a different man...${prompt};
I hereby conclude the coming-of-age ceremony of Claidie I d'Oraguille.${prompt};
So the baby princess has finally become a lady... Did you know that it is custom at the coming-of-age ceremony for the dark d'Oraguille secrets to be revealed?${prompt};
I'm sure you have already heard that during the Great War, the d'Oraguille family betrayed my father, Altedour, and dragged Tavnazia into ruin.${prompt};
Silence, infidel!${prompt};
Who are...${prompt};
Where did this vagrant come from!?${prompt};
No, I do not expect you to know who I am. This is the first time I have been to this cathedral.${prompt};
Wait, you look familiar. But you couldn't be...${prompt};
But I am. My name is Rochefogne I Tavnazia. Son of Altedour, and sole surviving heir to the Tavnazian throne.${prompt};
My mother's...brother!?${prompt};
Rochefogne!? You were slain in the Great War!${prompt};
You doubt your own eyes? Pitiful d'Oraguille. That will be the downfall of you all.${prompt};
Know this, d'Oraguilles: I will find Lightbringer. It is the destiny that drives me.${prompt};
After him!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Stop, scoundrel!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
Wait!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt};
That Rochefogne is a poison in our fair country. Dispatch the knights and have them comb the countryside--no, all of Vana'diel--for him!${prompt};
But how could it be...and what could he want with the holy sword...?${prompt};
Good day! Take a look at my selection from Li'Telor!${prompt};
Specialty goods from Vollbow! Specialty goods from Vollbow!${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Why must all craftsmen be so uptight?${prompt};
I wish to have a breastplate repaired at the Blacksmiths' Guild, but the people who work there are so difficult to approach...;
Would you mind coming with me?${prompt};
Go along?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, I'll go with you.;
I don't have time to hold your hand.${prompt};
You'll come?;
Thank you. I get so nervous sometimes!${prompt};
Excuse me... I would like to have this repaired. It's a keepsake from my father, but it's become a little weathered.${prompt};
Let's take a look...;
Ah, this is far too old to repair. You'd be better off buying a new one. We have a range of goods here, so why don't you go pick something out.${prompt};
I don't really want anything new, I just...${prompt};
Then you have no more business here. I'm sorry, miss, but I have better things to do than work on a relic like that.${prompt};
Oh, I see... Well, thank you for your time.${prompt};
That didn't go well at all.;
I appreciate you coming with me, though...${prompt};
Just a moment there, young lady.;
That's an interesting piece of armor you're carrying.;
Might I have a closer look?${prompt};
I, uh... Can I ask who you are, sir?${prompt};
Me? I am Ranchuriome, an unaffiliated blacksmith. I'm a craftsman that makes a scanty living taking on the jobs that the guild won't touch. Now, can I see that breastplate?${prompt};
I thought to have it repaired at the Blacksmiths' Guild, but they quite bluntly refused the job...${prompt};
And this is what you want to have fixed? Hmm... It's showing the passage of years, but I can see that it's been well cared for. This is well worth repairing. However...${prompt};
“However”? Will it be expensive?${prompt};
Not at all. This kind of thing I'd do for free. It's just that for items of this age, you need special tools. If I had ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} from the Eastern Altepa Desert...${prompt};
I...I hesitate to impose upon you again, but would it be at all possible for you to find me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}? Naturally, I will pay you for your troubles...${prompt};
Accept the task?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Oh, that's a shame...;
Maybe there is someone else I can ask.${prompt};
Once you have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, I'll do the necessary repairs.;
Good day to you.${prompt};
You'll help me?;
Thank you. It would mean so much to me.${prompt};
That's all settled then. I'll be here once you have the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} ready for me.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} can be found in the Eastern Altepa Desert.;
Please take care on your travels!${prompt};
So this is the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} that Ranchuriome was talking about. I am most grateful for your help.;
Please accept this as payment.${prompt};
Here, Ranchuriome. ${name-player} is the reason we have this!${prompt};
Excellent! You managed to find one. Now I can start on those repairs.;
I'll have it ready for you by dinnertime.${prompt};
I've really been feeling my years lately... No matter. I'm sure I'll perk up once I start working. I'll be back as soon as I'm done.${prompt};
I'm most grateful to you!${prompt};
You don't see many people with that kind of integrity around anymore. If my father was still alive, they would have struck up a solid friendship, I'm sure.${prompt};
Thanks to your help, my father's breastplate is looking like new, but... That nice old man, Ranchuriome, has passed away.${prompt};
I can't help but think it's my fault in some way...that the repairs he did for me were too strenuous. When I attended the funeral to pay my respects, though, his features seemed to be at peace.${prompt};
I attended Ranchuriome's funeral to pay my respects and express my thanks for his kindness.${prompt};
During the ceremony, I was distracted by an unusual lady among the mourners.${prompt};
Something about this woman seemed out of place. I tried to follow her after the funeral ended, but...${prompt};
I lost sight of her not long after.${prompt};
I searched around, trying to find her again. Instead, I came across Ranchuriome's son lying unconscious on the ground.${prompt};
I tended to his wound, and thankfully, he soon regained consciousness.;
I found this lying nearby.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} might be a clue as to what happened.${prompt};
It's probably just my overactive imagination, but perhaps it will help in some way. Here. You should hold on to it, just in case.${prompt};
A suspicious woman and ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}...;
Probably just my overactive imagination.${prompt};
Oh, that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} came in handy after all? That's wonderful! I'm glad I could help someone out in the same way that you and Ranchuriome helped me.${prompt};
I don't think I'm suited for a career as a detective, though... I think I'll concentrate on helping people in a way that's more within my capabilities.${prompt};
My name is Charlaimagnat. I am engaged in the translation of ancient texts found in ruins across Vana'diel.${prompt};
Ah, you must be the adventurer, ${name-player}. I have recently received correspondence from Alfesar. I believe you have a letter and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for me.${prompt};
As Alfesar reported in his letter, ancient magic is engraved upon this tablet.${prompt};
However, I will need more time to decipher all the text. I still cannot tell what magic this spell is for.${prompt};
Please return another day and I shall share with you what I have found. May Altana's providence guide you on your journey.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. I have finished deciphering the spell. I give you my thanks for your assistance.${prompt};
Now that the text is translated, we can produce copies. I would like to offer you one in expression of our gratitude.${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.${prompt};
Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Yippee! It must be destiny that brought us together!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.${prompt};
I can't talk about it too loudly, but have you ever seen one of those huge crystals?;
They're found all over the world, far into the wilderness, and deep down in dungeons...${prompt};
From those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth.;
Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt};
Well, take a look at this!${prompt};
As a result of our research, we finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt};
Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!;
However, they didn't appreciate being woken up, and attacked us.${prompt};
Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
I'm sure that you could do it!;
Will you help us out with our research? ${prompt};
Take up the challenge?;
${selection-lines};
Bring it on!;
Ah, no, thanks...${prompt};
Wonderful!;
Here, take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will awaken the giant crystal that is found ${choice: 2}[in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are!;
Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} from me. Okey-dokey?${prompt};
If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did! ${prompt};
As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again.;
I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...${prompt};
Excuse me!;
If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now is there?${prompt};
Is it true?${wait-36: 1};
You really defeated a prime avatar!?${prompt};
...I see.;
The prime avatar said that to you?;
I wonder what it could mean.${prompt};
...There is no need to understand...;
...You will forget what I have said...${prompt};
Y-you, you're...!?;
...You have power...${prompt};
...Will you allow...that power...;
...to slumber...for eternity...?${prompt};
Surrender...that power...to me...;
and I...will craft...that power...;
into whatever...you desire...${prompt};
...We meet...again...${prompt};
...I must...fulfill...my charge...${prompt};
...The beast...shall claim...its due...${prompt};
Choose...;
What...do you desire...? What...do you seek?${prompt};
What do you desire?;
${selection-lines};
Gil.;
Nothing (a pact with the avatar).${prompt};
...This is what you desire...?${prompt};
You want ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Wait!${prompt};
You want ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Wait!${prompt};
You want ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?;

Listen to the voice within you!${prompt};
If you focus, you will see the true Vana'diel!${prompt};
...Even if...that...;
Uh?;
Huh? I went all spacey-wacey for a moment there...${prompt};
Um, excuse me, but who were you again?;
Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?${prompt};
Did I already tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst?${prompt};
You are now able to summon ${choice: 2}[Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].${prompt};
Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt};
Hey, Juroro!;
Oh, it's Ildy-Goldy!${prompt};
It's been some time since you made that tuning fork. Are you still researching those giant-viant crystals?${prompt};
Ah, yes, I've asked a veteran adventurer to look into that for me, but ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] hasn't come back yet.${prompt};
...Wait.;
Did ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] come back already?;
...Or did I even ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to do that yet?${prompt};
Vhat's wrong vith you? Pull yourself together, man.;
I don't think the food in this country agrees with you. Or maybe you haven't been getting enough snoozy-vooze time lately?${prompt};
No, it's nothing like that...;
I guess I have been kinda tired lately, though...${prompt};
Vell, no mattaru.;
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Adventurer, you look like the reliable-viable type. Maybe you can help me out here. Take this ${item-singular: 3[2]} to the Quicksand Caves in the Eastern Altepa Desert.${prompt};
Using my improved tuning fork of earth along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, should allow more people to be drawn into the crystal than using the regular ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Ildy-Goldy is extremely-wemely proficient in hand-to-hand combat, something very unusual among we Tarutaru. He's always high on the list when researchers are looking for a Rhinostery adventurer to accompany them to the wild lands.${prompt};
With his skill, he's likely to defeat the avatar that slumbers within the protocrystal.${prompt};
Please make your way to the Quicksand Caves of the Eastern Altepa Desert and bring the ${item-singular: 5[2]} into contact with the crystal.${prompt};
...By the way...;
You probably want to assist Ildy-Goldy with his experiment, but have you ever thought of doing your own investigation into the protocrystals?${prompt};
Do you want to do your own investigation?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I thirst for knowledge!;
Um, not really...${prompt};
Well, then.;
First, let me introduce myself.${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
You lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}!?${prompt};
What a spacey-wacey individual...;
Well, I guess I'll give you a new one.${prompt};
Welcome back.;
Ildy-Goldy returned a little while before. He's been waiting for you.${prompt};
Oh good, you made it back in one piece.;
I'm sorry about before, I was completely-vetely caught up with chasing down Uran-Mafran.${prompt};
I didn't end up collaring him, though. Those mages can be a slippery-vippery bunch...${prompt};
...But at least ve know the reason vhy the researchers have been acting so odd-voddly lately.${prompt};
It vas all his doing.;
Uran-Mafran... He's been erasing everybody's memories.${prompt};
Vhen you get back to Vindurst, could you report this to the principal?${prompt};
I don't know if Principal Koru-Moru vill remember Uran-Mafran, but it's vorth a shot.${prompt};
Urrrrgh...${prompt};
Ah, excuse me!;
I need your help!${prompt};
I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1} from me and took off!${prompt};
I have absolutaruly no obligation to hand over that incredibly difficult-to-make tuning fork to someone so uncooperative towards the Rhinostery's experiment!${prompt};
I beg of you!;
I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1} from me and took off!${prompt};
Please chase after that knave and take back the ${color: 5}improved tuning fork of ice${color: 1}!${prompt};
...What's that you say? You'll help me get back the improved tuning fork but you also want to investigate the protocrystal in Fei'Yin?${prompt};
Investigate the crystal in Fei'Yin?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
...Well then, allow me to introduce myself...${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
The improved tuning fork was used by that rougue...?${prompt};
But it didn't work properly?;
Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt};
...Oh dear Goddess...;
Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt};
When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt};
Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt};
Please take this.;
North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?${prompt};
...Well, I must regain my focus and continue with my work...${prompt};
Um, I'm looking for an adventurer to investigate a protocrystal in this area.${prompt};
Investigate?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not right now...${prompt};
Well, then.;
I should start by introducing myself...${prompt};
I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt};
...We m-m-meet again...;
...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt};
...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions.;
...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?${prompt};
..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?${prompt};
Hahaha...;
...Rather than strength without purpose...;
...you should be seeking...true power...${prompt};
...We m-m-meet...again...;
I shall...fulfill...my charge.${prompt};
The beast...shall claim...its due...${prompt};
I shall...see it...carried out...${prompt};
What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Hrmmm...;
So it's time to use...no...${prompt};
Hello?;
You're an adventurer, right?;
Maybe you can help us out.${prompt};
Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt};
I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt};
But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt};
We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.;
Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt};
Listen, muscle-hussle brain.;
Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt};
Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt};
That's where you come in.;
I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt};
No no no no no!;
Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt};
Listen up.;
And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt};
...;
Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
You do have a point there...;
I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt};
No, one round could not hurt.${prompt};
You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.;
Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt};
Are you really-dilly sure?;
${selection-lines};
Fork me!;
On second thought...${prompt};
Well, you asked for it!;
Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt};
I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt};
I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.;
Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt};
Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt};
Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt};
Are you sure you are ready?;
${selection-lines};
Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!;
Not just yet...${prompt};
Ma'am, our adventurer has completed ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] preparations and requests a warp.${prompt};
...;
Alacazimzam-scooby-dooby...;
...;
Sha-mone!;
Don't use that excuse on me, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].;
If you want another ${item-singular: 1[2]}, all you have to do ask.${prompt};
If you do not bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]} we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].${prompt};
Did you remember to bring the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
What!?;
You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt};
Ma'am!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt};
...;
Ma'am...${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
(Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)${prompt};
I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another ${item-singular: 1[2]} near a giant crystal.${prompt};
Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Fork me baby, one more time.;
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.${prompt};
Hey! You're that famous adventurer, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Maybe you can help us outaru!${prompt};
Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt};
You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?${prompt};
Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?;
And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt};
You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt};
Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt};
Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt};
Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt};
Would you be interested in purchasing some adventurer-issue armor? Be careful when selecting, as we accept no refunds.${prompt};
Currently, the cathedral is conducting preparations for the Rites of Succession. If it were not for the outbreak at the coming-of-age ceremony, the services of the Temple Knights would not have been necessary...${prompt};
The responsibility of conducting such an important event has taken its toll on all of us here. Even His Holiness has been on edge as of late.${prompt};
I'm sorry ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, but due to matters of security, I am not to allow anyone into the chateau until the Rites of Succession have taken place.${prompt};
I hereby declare the commencement of the Rites of Succession.;
The terms of selection will coincide with those found engraved on the recently discovered stone tablet of the Dragon King, Ranperre.${prompt};
“Light will befall the great Vana'diel only when the true heir of d'Oraguille raises Lightbringer to the heavens.”${prompt};
We shall now watch as the two princes attempt to draw forth the holy sword.${prompt};
Only then will it be known which is worthy to become our next king.${prompt};
Your Highness, have you any objections?${prompt};
I have none. Continue with the ceremony.${prompt};
Prince Trion, come forth...${prompt};
Wait!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Who goes there!?;
Are you oblivious to the events that are transpiring here today?${prompt};
I am completely aware! That is why I have come!${prompt};
Coteaulepoint? What has come over you?${prompt};
No... That voice...;
You are none other than the rogue, Rochefogne!${prompt};
I could care less of this play you perform for your own amusement. I have come for one reason, and one reason only--to take Lightbringer.${prompt};
You should be dead! What is the meaning of this!?${prompt};
Hah. If you refer to the assassins you sent to kill me, you may be able to find them...at the bottom of the Bastore Sea.${prompt};
Their hidden identities only assisted me in erasing them, unnoticed, from the face of Vana'diel. And that is how I was successful in crashing your little party.${prompt};
If you do not wish to see your lovely sister's head rolling on the floor, you had best hand over Lightbringer.${prompt};
Why, you...${prompt};
As you wish, Rochefogne.;
On the count of three, I will throw you the holy sword, and you shall let the princess go.${prompt};
One...${prompt};
Two...${prompt};
THREE!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
A wise decision, Trion.${prompt};
I need not your praise.;
But perhaps you may enlighten us--how do you plan to escape whilst surrounded by our Royal Knights?${prompt};
Compared to what I have gone through to get this sword, escaping from this place will be child's play.${prompt};
And what if the sword you hold is not the true Lightbringer?${prompt};
What?;
Why, you...!${prompt};
We had been expecting you all along. When your body did not turn up, we assumed that you were still out there, planning your next move. However, we did not expect that you would be posing as one of our own men.${prompt};
Ugh...${prompt};
Now has come the time to end your life--and the darkness that lurks about it. Come forth, O Lightbringer!${prompt};
Trion! No!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
Claidie, now!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};
We cannot let Lightbringer fall into the hands of those fiends!${prompt};
What is going on here?;
Where is Lightbringer!?${prompt};
Why!? The sword was unsheathed, but the Gates of Paradise did not open!${prompt};
The Gates of Paradise...?${prompt};
Hah! You know nothing of what that sword can do.${prompt};
That sword is the evil weapon that destroyed my country...${prompt};
How do you know this?${prompt};
I know this only because it was I who drew Lightbringer and brought an end to my homeland.${prompt};
It cannot be!${prompt};
Now is not the time to explain. However, Trion, you now know why I must reseal the holy sword.${prompt};
When I removed Lightbringer from its sheathe, it felt as if I had all of Vana'diel in the palm of my hand...as if all other life on this planet was useless...${prompt};
Had your sister not thrown the dreamrose pollen at you, you would have most certainly been consumed by the power of the sword.${prompt};
We must retrieve Lightbringer from the grasp of the Orcs, then return it to its proper resting place in King Ranperre's Tomb. If we do not, another country may vanish from the face of...Vana'diel...${prompt};
Rochefogne!?${prompt};
Then Lightbringer is not a bringer of light, but a bringer of darkness...?${prompt};
Trion! Trion!;
Did you not hear Rochefogne? We must send our knights immediately!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Trion! Get a hold of yourself!;
Rahal! Ready the Royal Knights and track down those Orcs!;
Curilla! Double the patrols of the Temple Knights in the city!;
As for the rest of you--let us retreat to the castle so we can plan our next move. Dismissed!${prompt};
As for you, Shamonde...;
I have a few questions...${prompt};
Was it our lack of faith that brought this time of despair upon us?${prompt};
The papsque is currently being held at the Chateau d'Oraguille for questioning on the matters at hand. I have never seen His Holiness so disturbed...${prompt};
Other than those who attended, none know of what took place at the Rites of Succession. However, I must be strong, as not to bring worry upon the members of our faith.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
I see you have same the doubts as I.${prompt};
We would like to see the papsque in private.${prompt};
Your Highness, I have been given strict orders to not allow anyone near His Holiness without the accompaniment of a Temple Knight...${prompt};
I understand your orders. It was I who gave them.;
Now step aside. I will take all responsibility for any actions taken by the papsque.${prompt};
Yes, Your Highness.${prompt};
Your...Holiness.${prompt};
Prince Pieuje...${prompt};
May I ask you one question? Why did you have my brother draw Lightbringer and open the Gates of Paradise?${prompt};
The Gates of Paradise...;
When the war came to a close and I saw with my own eyes what was left of Tavnazia, I was convinced that the only way to save the world was by finding and opening those gates.${prompt};
But what exactly are the Gates of Paradise?${prompt};
I searched hundreds of works of literature... However, the true meaning of the Gates of Paradise remained a mystery.${prompt};
I was about to abandon my search, when one day, the Archduke of Jeuno's younger brother visited me here in this cathedral. It was then that he told me how Lightbringer was the key to opening the gates.${prompt};
Lord Eald'narche?${prompt};
But if it was not true, why would he say such a thing...? To think that Lightbringer could be the cause of so much pain and suffering...${prompt};
Now I have finally realized that the true Gates of Paradise lie not in some fantasy world, but here in our hearts. And perhaps it is time that I unlock the gates in mine...${prompt};
Paradise lies within our hearts...${prompt};
While my soul is still heavy with the sins I have committed against this great kingdom, His Highness has granted me amnesty.${prompt};
From this day forth, until the day I stand before the Goddess for judgement, I will concentrate my prayers on bringing hope to all those on Vana'diel.${prompt};
I will believe your words, but from this day forth, I wish to take my own path to Paradise.;
I pray that both our dreams be fulfilled.${prompt};
The papsque has returned from Chateau d'Oraguille and will now pay penitence for his sins.;
He will be allowed to perform his normal duties, however, a Temple Knight escort will accompany him when leaving the cathedral.${prompt};
Perhaps the time to reconsider the role of the Gates to Paradise is upon us. May the knowledge of the papsque's sins guide us to a better path.${prompt};

Welcome to the Regional Teleportation Service!${prompt};
Greetings, adventurer. My name is ${name-npc}. I have been sent by the Specialty Goods Trade Union.${prompt};
At the previous Conference of Nations, it was decided that the restriction on “regional teleporting” would be lifted, and that cities could now offer teleportation services to various outposts.${prompt};
We are now authorized to teleport you to any outpost you have previously visited on a supplies quest.${prompt};
The nominal fee we require varies with the current control of the region.${prompt};
Also, depending on your level, there may be some areas I am not authorized to teleport you to.${prompt};
That region is ${choice: 2}[no longer under your home country's control./currently under your home country's control.] You will require ${number: 1} gil or ${number: 3} conquest ${choice-plurality: 3}[point/points] to teleport.${prompt};
As a special, limited-time service to commemorate the recovery of the full mog tablet set, I can teleport you to your destination absolutely free of charge!${prompt};
Teleport?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Teleport with gil.;
Teleport with conquest points.;
Later.${prompt};
Have a wonderful journey!${prompt};
Unfortunately, at this time there is nowhere I can teleport you. Please come again.${prompt};
You have not yet reached level 10. I am sorry, but for safety reasons, I am not authorized to teleport anyone under the current level cap.${prompt};
You do not have enough gil. Please come back again.${prompt};
You do not have enough gil.${prompt};
You do not have enough conquest points. Please come back again.${prompt};
You do not have enough conquest points.${prompt};
We look forward to seeing you again!${prompt};
However, at this time I am only authorized to teleport citizens of ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].${prompt};
Debug: Warp to region ${number: 0}!${prompt};
For a limited time during the Starlight Celebration, the Specialty Goods Trade Union is offering all registered adventurers a deal you could not possibly think of passing up.${prompt};
Trade me a mere ten ${item-plural: 1[2]} and I will teleport you to the outpost of any region of your choice, regardless of your current level or which nation has control of the area.${prompt};
However, remember that the S.G.T.U will take no responsibility for any...unexpected circumstances that may occur as a result of teleporting to an area with enemies beyond the range of your main job's level.${prompt};
Normally, I am only authorized to teleport citizens of ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], but for a limited time only, my services are open to all registered adventurers.${prompt};
Trade me a mere ten ${item-plural: 1[2]} and I will teleport you to the outpost of any region of your choice, regardless of your current level or which nation has control of the area.${prompt};
However, remember that the S.G.T.U will take no responsibility for any...unexpected circumstances that may occur as a result of teleporting to an area with enemies beyond the range of your main job's level.${prompt};
This service will last for the duration of the Starlight Celebration.${prompt};
Thank you very much for taking part in our holiday special!${prompt};
If I remember correctly, you just made your payment a few moments ago.${prompt};
I apologize, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].;
You have not completed any supplies quests, thus there are no regions to which I am authorized to teleport you.${prompt};
The recommended level for the requested area is ${number: 0}. Are you sure you would like to teleport there?${prompt};
Your ten ${item-plural: 0[2]} are returned to you.${prompt};
Your inventory is full and you cannot carry the ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Come back when you have created more room in your bag.${prompt};
Here you can learn the fate and fortune of an adventuring duo.${prompt};
For a mere 120 gil, I will divine what today will bring for you and ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
Pay 120 gil for a fortune telling?;
${selection-lines};
Pay up.;
I make my own fortune.${prompt};
Now, let us see what the winds portend...${prompt};
Adventuring with ${entity: 0} today will ${choice: 1}[bring you great fortune!/be highly profitable./bring fair fortune./be mutually advantageous./bring misfortune./be perilous./be disastrous!]${prompt};
Good fortune fills your cup to overflowing. Be sure to share it with those less blessed by fate.${prompt};
Stand together and you have little to fear. With your combined strength, you can overcome any obstacle.${prompt};
Do not let your good fortune blind you to danger. Pitfalls aplenty await the unwary traveler.${prompt};
Happiness is a state of mind. You can find laughter in even the most desperate of situations.${prompt};
The day ahead will be filled with trials and tribulations, but in time the path before you will run smooth once more.${prompt};
There may be clashes of opinion today, but approach each other with an open mind and all will be well.${prompt};
You must rely on each others' strengths to overcome the difficulties you will face today. Don't let petty squabbles bring your downfall.${prompt};
Please accept this modest gift in celebration of your good fortune.${prompt};
Either you or ${entity: 0} has already heard fate's fickle will today. You may only have your fortune told once every Vana'dielian day.${prompt};
Form a party with the person you wish to check your fortune with, and then speak with me for a reading of your fate.${prompt};
You need 120 gil to have your fortune told.${prompt};
Trick or treat...${prompt};
Thank you...;
And now for your treat...${prompt};
Here, take this...${prompt};
If you put this on and walk around, something...unexpected might happen...${prompt};
Thank you...${prompt};
If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...${prompt};
People are wallowing in sin...;
There are so many weak-spirited heathens who cannot go a day without lying, cheating, or stealing from their fellows.${prompt};
And still there are other insatiable fools who crave forbidden fruit and violate our holy law with abandon. Yet for the Gates of Paradise to open, we must reach out a forgiving hand to these deluded wretches.${prompt};
And now...;
Let us assume an item thou hast obtained in your lust for material possession has been warped by the wrath of the spirits.${prompt};
These items are in a cursed state. Useless items that, if left to their own devices, will bring down upon thee a terrible fate. That curse shall remain until the spirits are appeased by the acquisition of an “abjuration.”${prompt};
"An abjuration is the one and only key capable of quieting the spirits and removing the curse. It requires great hardship and suffering to obtain one; however, this penance is necessary for the cleansing of thy soul.${prompt}";
If thou bringst unto me a cursed item and its opposing abjuration, I shall invoke the blessing of the Goddess and remove thy curse.${prompt};
Thou needst not hasten thy steps. When the time is right, thou shalt hear more of curses and abjurations.${prompt};
Until that time, it is best that thou forgettest what thou hast learned and be on thy way. May the Gates of Paradise open unto thee.${prompt};
This is most unfortunate... However, if thou hast not the appropriate abjuration to counter the curse, then I may not perform the purification ceremony. When thou hast obtained the abjuration, come once again to my side.${prompt};
Verily, this is the abjuration that is required. Thou hast done well. If thou bringst the opposing cursed item, I shall perform the purification ceremony forthwith.${prompt};
Hmm? Ah, my apologies, I was lost in thought. Was there something I could aid you with, my child?${prompt};
Praise to the Goddess! Thou hast safely returned from the trial of the spirits. Let us perform the purification ceremony at once. At my urging, raise thy hand in supplication to the heavens.${prompt};
Great Goddess Altana.;
In recognition of the penance ${name-player} has paid, I beg thee to remove the blight upon the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and absolve ${name-player} of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] sin...${prompt};
The blight upon the ${item-singular: 0[2]} is weakening... It has been transformed into ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Thy suffering hath been rewarded. Proof of thy redemption lies in the ${item-singular: 1[2]} before thee. Thou hast been blessed, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Continue thy journey into the light.;
May the Gates of Paradise open unto thee.${prompt};
What is the meaning of this? Dost thou propose to insult a cardinal of Altana? If thou persists in this tomfoolery, I shall be forced to call upon the Temple Knights to teach thee some manners...${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! Much I have heard of your noble efforts on the battlefield. If it is not too much of a bother, your assistance is requested for a special mission.${prompt};
The mission requires escorting the noble young missus Lady Cannau, the only daughter of a highly respectable family. However, she is--how would you say--a tad rambunctious. Embarrassed I am to report that we have already had many a proud adventurer quit this task the moment they met her.${prompt};
If you have courage enough to take on this adventure, travel to the Eldieme Necropolis. Whether Lady Cannau is there or not is another question...${prompt};
You shall be compensated generously upon the completion of your task.;
Good luck and Godspeed.${prompt};
You shall find Miss Cannau in the Eldieme Necropolis. That is, if you are lucky enough to spot her...${prompt};
Wait...;
Are you to say that you wish to cancel your contract with us?${prompt};
Cancel your contract?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I see... That is quite disappointing...${prompt};
Ah, I heard from my men that you have been successful in escorting the missus. I applaud you on your composure throughout the task.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
I have the feeling this may not be the last time the missus goes galavanting about the necropolis. When that time comes, again we may require your assistance.${prompt};
Forget not the labors of the common folk, as they ever support this mighty kingdom.${prompt};
It's time for the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza, kupo!;
Here, take this “initial egg.” Collect and trade eggs until you have made a “First 3” combination. When you're done, bring the combo back to me for an egg-squisite prize, kupo!${prompt};
This year, those who make special undecennial combinations will receive particularly egg-ceptional prizes, kupo!${prompt};
Of course, we wouldn't want you counting your chocobos before they hatch. Please egg-xert the effort to make a “First 3” combination before going all out on these spegg-tacular new ones, kupo.${prompt};
When you've gathered a “First 3” combination, bring the eggs back to me! Also, if you want, I can trade you more initial eggs, but you'll have to make it worth my while, kupo!${prompt};
Well, that's it for my anniversary egg-splanation. Happy hunting, kupo!${prompt};
Egg-cellent! Here's your prize, kupo!;
Now if only somebody would bring me a super combo... Oh, egg-scuse me! Forget I said that, kupo!${prompt};

Here's your special prize, kupo!;
But how did you figure out the secret combination...?${prompt};
How in-eggs-plicably astounding! You're truly a hard-boiled detective of the highest degree, kupo!;
Here's your prize, and don't forget to enjoy the rest of the festivities.${prompt};
Hey, don't get all egg-cited!;
You can only claim one prize a day, kupo!${prompt};
These initial eggs are really egg-spensive, kupo! If you want one I'm going to need a little more incentive. No egg-ceptions!${prompt};
Eggs-actly what I wanted! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
Ku-kupo! Such an egg-stravagant item, for little old me? Here's a whole basketful of initial eggs for you, kupo!${prompt};
My eyes! My eyes!;
Get out of here, and take those egg-ceptionally nasty things with you, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...;
Kupo～～～! Please! No more, kupo!;
Here, take these and get out of here, kupo!${prompt};
Hey, I can only trade with you once a day. We wouldn't want to make the egg hunt “over easy,” now, kupo!${prompt};
Hey, you look new here, kupo!;
If you need anything, just let me know!${prompt};
Heh heh heh...;
I have something egg-specially egg-citing in store for you, kupo!${prompt};

What is a mentor, you ask?;
Well, in short, a mentor is an experienced adventurer who is willing to offer some of their time to help out their less traveled companions.${prompt};
If this sounds like the job for you, then feel free to sign up today.${prompt};
To become a mentor, you must have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt};
Accepting ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} requires that you have over 180 hours of play time...${prompt};
...and have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082828080}.${prompt};
Please note that registering and serving as a mentor, as well as utilizing the services of the Mentor Program, are to be done at the player's own discretion.${prompt};
SQUARE ENIX will not be held responsible for the actions and/or comments of any mentors. No benefits of any kind will be provided to those who choose to participate in the Mentor Program.${prompt};
When you agree to participate in the Mentor Program, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood the above terms.${prompt};
I am sorry, but you do not meet the requirements necessary to accept the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt};
Please speak to me again once you have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}. I will then judge whether or not you meet the requirements.${prompt};
You have accepted ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, yes? Then let me check my materials here...${prompt};
Congratulations! You are qualified to be a mentor!${prompt};
My materials here say that you don't meet the requirements. Keep at it!${prompt};
Would you like to serve as a mentor?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You are now a registered mentor.${prompt};
Mentor status can also be switched on and off in the “Config” menu found within the “Help Desk.”${prompt};
You are already a registered mentor.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}A new objective, ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, has been added to Records of Eminence.;
You want to know about mannequins? Ha ha, there's a word I haven't heard in quite a long time. What would a young adventurer such as yourself want with such an outdated piece?${prompt};
Well, I'm not one to judge people on their tastes.;
Yes, there was a time when we here at the Carpenters' Guild manufactured nearly all of the mannequins in the Kingdom. They were our best sellers.${prompt};
Why, that catalog you have there--that was one of many published and printed by us.${prompt};
We had so many orders that we had to work twenty-five hours a day to keep up. That is, until the accident...${prompt};
Hmph. I can tell by the look on your face that you wish for me to continue. Very well...${prompt};
There was to be a grand fashion show held by the Weavers' Guild in Windurst, and they needed a large quantity of mannequins to display all their new clothes and armor.${prompt};
It was an enormous undertaking. However, honored to receive such a tremendous order from the Federation, the guildmaster at the time accepted the challenge without hesitation.${prompt};
And, as promised, the guild finished all of the beautifully constructed mannequins within the allotted time frame and sent them off to Windurst.${prompt};
However, as the shipment was being carried down the Phanauet Channel through Jugner Forest, the ferry was attacked by beastmen. The fiends must have thought the ship was a transport vessel for knights and supplies.${prompt};
The few adventurers that accompanied the ship were no match for the enemy, and the ship and her cargo were lost...${prompt};
Days later, our guild received a message from Windurst saying that they refused to pay for the stolen mannequins, going as far as citing our negligence in guarding the shipment as justification. Outraged by this blatant breach of contract, our guild continued to demand payment. This “feud” of sorts lasted for years.${prompt};
But that was not the only problem that arose from the accident...;
Weeks after the attack, the beastmen began throwing the arms, legs, and heads of their “prizes” over our town walls and into our streets. It was as if they were bragging of their victory.${prompt};
Seeing this filled the hearts of the townspeople with fear. Mannequins soon became a symbol of ill fate, and those that remained in shops and guilds were destroyed.${prompt};
As a craftsman, it pains me to know that idle superstition has taken such a precedence over fine work. And that is why, as a craftsman, I give my full support to anyone who wishes to recreate such a product. Unfortunately, our guild no longer has any of the materials needed for building a mannequin, nor do I know of one who possesses the skill to construct the pieces necessary.${prompt};
Ah, but I do have something that may be of use to you.;
The goldsmith that constructed the joints for our mannequins left these diagrams. They are of no use to me... Perhaps if a goldsmith were to view them, the plans might give some sort of clue as to their manufacture.${prompt};
I can also tell you that in addition to the joints, the following parts were needed to complete a mannequin: ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
However, you won't find any of those items up on auction. Their sale has been prohibited ever since the accident. If there are any left, they'd be in the hands of the beastmen themselves.${prompt};
Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
You're not wearing your yukata!;
Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!;
I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt};
Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!;
When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
Incredible, kupo!;
You must have nerves of darksteel!;
Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
You haven't earned my really special present yet!;
Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt};
Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?;
I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt};
Here, take this as a testament to your courage.;
Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt};
Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!;
Kupupupu...${prompt};
This place is crawling with nasties.;
You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt};
Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt};
I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.;
This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt};
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt};

Basic rules.;
Official/private matches.;
Flammen-Brenner.;
Flamme.;
Match score.;
Petras and quarrying.;
Sprint.;
KO.;
Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
The door is locked tight...${prompt};
Head for Carpenters' Landing?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
So this is the San d'Orian Cathedral...;
Together with the Tavnazian Cathedral, they form the pillars of our faith.${prompt};
If anyone is truly attempting to open the Gates of Paradise, I am certain it is someone in there...${prompt};
Have you lost your way on the path of life? Come, listen to our sermon. Let us be your guide to the light of Paradise.${prompt};
What is this?;
You wish to know of the Multinational Expedition and its search for the Gate of the Gods?${prompt};
That is quite odd... Not but a few moments ago, another came asking the same questions. I believe her name was Ulmia. Be she an acquaintance of yours?${prompt};
How do you answer?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I see.;
Ulmia, too, wished to learn more of the Gate of the Gods, so I recommended that she attend the upcoming sermon on the subject.${prompt};
Yes, by all means you may attend as well. My sermon will begin momentarily.${prompt};
Eschew all desire and embrace Altana. Only then will she bless you in her glory.${prompt};
That is all for today's sermon. May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt};
I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to hear your sermon.${prompt};
However, there are still many things I do not understand. Would you be so kind as to spare a few moments to answer my questions?${prompt};
Of course, my child. What is it you wish to know?${prompt};
When I was young, I often heard the stories of Paradise.${prompt};
A legendary land where the gods slumber...;
A gate leading to that land, discovered by the ancients...${prompt};
However, according to the stories I heard, the ancients angered the Twilight God by attempting to open the forbidden gate. As punishment, he cast a terrible curse upon them all...${prompt};
If this hideous tale is true, then why is the San d'Orian Cathedral attempting to convince people that we should open the gates...?${prompt};
Or has the cathedral discovered a method to soothe the wrath of the gods?${prompt};
...;
I must assume that you are not of our kingdom.${prompt};
That is correct. I was born in the Marquisate of Tavnazia, and baptized by the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt};
Our church, too, teaches of the Gates of the Gods--the Gates of Paradise. However, we are told it is a line that the children of Vana'diel have been forbidden to cross.${prompt};
The exact opposite of what the San d'Orian Cathedral teaches...${prompt};
For the past twenty years, we have searched tirelessly for an entrance to Paradise.${prompt};
And it is during that search we realized that the only path to soothing the Twilight God's wrath is to eschew all desire and embrace Altana.${prompt};
That is all...?${prompt};
I apologize, but I must prepare for my next sermon.;
If you wish to learn more, inquire with one of the high priests.${prompt};
It is the lifework of our missionaries to enlighten. May they lead you in the direction of truth...${prompt};
Before the Great War, when the former papsque, Muchavatte P Couchiret, was still with us...${prompt};
During his time, we believed that the Gates of Paradise were hidden somewhere within the reach of mortal man.${prompt};
The Royal Knight you search for, Francmage M Mistalle, joined the Multinational Expedition thirty years ago to search for the truth behind that belief. And it is because of that very search...${prompt};
Welcome, travelers. Even after listening to the vicasque's sermon, you still have questions regarding Paradise?${prompt};
Very well. Please, step this way and I will try to quench your thirst for knowledge.${prompt};
This is the cathedral Reliquary. It was built in remembrance of one of our former papsques, Muchavatte P Couchiret.${prompt};
During his papacy, the papsque devoted himself to healing the wounds in the hearts of man--wounds left by the flames of war.${prompt};
The Dawn Goddess watched over him and his work, and blessed him with her glory.${prompt};
However, that is not all she gave him. Before his passing, Altana showed the papsque the path to Paradise.${prompt};
The path to Paradise...?${prompt};
Yes. His final words told us that to obtain Paradise, one must eschew all desire and embrace the Dawn Goddess.${prompt};
For many years, we believed that the path to Paradise and gates guarding it were things that actually existed on Vana'diel.${prompt};
The cathedral scoured through the ancient tomes and documents in our vaults, went to war with other nations...${prompt};
I have heard that San d'Oria even attacked the Tavnazian Cathedral... All this to find a Paradise that was only meant to exist in our hearts...${prompt};
Instilling fear to find a land where mankind could live without fear. This paradox ultimately put distance between us and Altana.${prompt};
But thanks to the teachings of Muchavatte, we have realized the error of our ways and thus made it our mission to enlighten our brothers and sisters regarding the true path to Paradise.${prompt};
Do you understand?${prompt};
Yes, I believe I do.${prompt};
However, I have one last question. How are we to break free from the curse of the Twilight God?${prompt};
That is...${prompt};
It is forbidden to speak of the abhorrent one.${prompt};
Of all things, you should know this well, child of Tavnazia.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Travelers, you need not worry.${prompt};
It is our duty to serve Altana and introduce her blessed light to the unfortunate masses.${prompt};
If we follow the teachings of the Dawn Goddess and do not stray from the path of righteousness, the chains of evil will be broken and the Gates of Paradise will open.${prompt};
Yes... I see now...;
Thank you very much for your kindness in explaining this all to us.${prompt};
No, you need not thank me. I am simply pleased to know that you now understand the truth behind Paradise.${prompt};
Wait...${prompt};
You said that you seek the Royal Knight Francmage M Mistalle, did you not?${prompt};
If I am not mistaken, I recall a section of Jugner Forest known as Carpenters' Landing being owned by the Knights Mistalle.${prompt};
I do not believe you will be able to reach the manor, but you may find some of his hands by the water collecting firewood.${prompt};
Ah, the adventurer I conversed with in the reliquary...${prompt};
You say you are searching for one Sir Louverance, an envoy of the cathedral?${prompt};
He would be the grandson of Francmage M Mistalle, the Royal Knight you were investigating earlier.${prompt};
"That Sir Louverance had retired from the Royal Knights is common knowledge; however, I have heard nothing of his enlistment in the order of Temple Knights.${prompt}";
If we high priests were not informed of his return to military service, he must be entrusted with a mission of the highest importance indeed.${prompt};
It would seem to me that if Sir Louverance is traveling by airship, then the wisest place to search for him would be the port. Do you not agree?${prompt};
I was not aware that Sir Louverance was acting as an envoy for the cathedral.${prompt};
However, if he is traveling by airship, perhaps you should await his return to San d'Oria at the port.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
My curiosity was sufficiently piqued to do some investigating of my own into the Knights Mistalle...${prompt};
It is lovely to see you again, High Priest Chasalvige.;
I am afraid I neglected to properly introduce myself at our first meeting.${prompt};
My name is Ulmia.;
I was advised to seek your counsel by Lady Hinaree.${prompt};
Now I understand.${prompt};
The reason for your keen interest in the nature of Paradise and the curse of the Twilight God is clear to me.${prompt};
Lady Ulmia.;
And you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You need not fear being overheard in this place.;
Let us be entirely truthful with one another and speak openly of these matters.${prompt};
...Matters concerning the Tavnazian choir's efforts to complete the five verses.${prompt};
You know of the song...?${prompt};
Before the advent of the Great War, you came to visit Lady Hinaree with Cardinal Mildaurion and her companion, did you not?${prompt};
I was permitted to accompany Papsque Muchavatte, and was present at the proceedings.${prompt};
I am certain that at that time, you had little idea of the reason behind that gathering.${prompt};
It was, in fact, a meeting to improve the failing relations between the cathedrals of San d'Oria and Tavnazia.${prompt};
In particular, there seemed to be no end to the unsavory rumors surrounding the Tavnazian Cathedral.;
This was perhaps due to the strict policy of secrecy the Tavnazians had adopted following the period of internecine conflict in San d'Oria.${prompt};
The papsque sent a messenger to determine the accuracy of these rumors.${prompt};
However, Cardinal Mildaurion arrived accompanied by two young girls.${prompt};
And one of those girls--you, Ulmia--sang a certain song...${prompt};
Yes, I remember.;
But my voice was still untrained and Papsque Muchavatte grew furious at my terrible singing.${prompt};
No, child, that is not why he was angry.;
The reason behind the papsque's outburst was his fear that the song you were singing would be completed...${prompt};
He was frantic to stem the dreadful power of that song.${prompt};
Dreadful power?${prompt};
It is perhaps for the best that you remained ignorant of the truth.${prompt};
This story finds its beginning almost five hundred years ago...;
It reaches back to an era considered to be a time of humiliation for the Elvaan.${prompt};
At that time, the Quon continent was under the control of an army dispatched by the Federation of Windurst.${prompt};
The Elvaan race had yet to form a nation of their own, and the numerous tribes lived in forests apart from one another.${prompt};
But even as now, the blood of the Elvaan ran deep with pride.;
Swearing victory upon his sword, the hero Lanfeaur d'Oraguille came forth to lead our people to freedom.${prompt};
Along with General Alphollon Tajeux, who was later to become the Marquis of Tavnazia, they founded a kingdom on the strength of two valuable artifacts.${prompt};
However, after the battle to emancipate the Elvaan, both of these treasures were lost.${prompt};
In their respective places in the cathedrals of San d'Oria and Tavnazia, two mysterious stone tablets were left behind.${prompt};
We toiled long and hard to solve the riddles of the tablets, and were finally able to retrieve one of the objects in the age of King Ranperre--the holy sword, Lightbringer.${prompt};
In spite of this success, the Tavnazian Cathedral refused to reveal the contents of the second tablet.${prompt};
A secret investigation instigated by the San d'Orian Cathedral discovered the writings upon the stone were actually the verses of a song.${prompt};
Yes, you know this song only too well...;
It was the Lay of the Immortals.${prompt};
It was a song that would conclude with the manifestation of a deity.${prompt};
A song to call the gods!?;
I never knew...${prompt};
The Tavnazian Cathedral had deciphered the words, but the melody yet eluded them.;
The search for one who could perform the song was apparently long and arduous.${prompt};
However, when you appeared and were able to sing the opening verse, the song showed its first promise of power.${prompt};
But I...!;
I was told the lay was sung to prove that Prishe was not the abhorrent one!${prompt};
I know this. That is why I summoned you here to explain the truth behind these matters.${prompt};
I have learned from ${choice: 2}[Lady Hinaree/this adventurer] that a knight is searching for Cardinal Mildaurion under orders from the San d'Orian Cathedral.${prompt};
From what I could discover, he has traveled to the Northlands to learn more about the Twilight God.${prompt};
!${prompt};
I know not her purpose, but Cardinal Mildaurion was also seeking knowledge regarding Promathia.${prompt};
Cardinal Mildaurion!?${prompt};
Please heed my words.;
Never forget the significance of that song, or your own worth as one who holds knowledge of its mysteries. If the cardinal discovers that you still live...${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
Lady Ulmia, I implore you:;
Find your companion and return to Tavnazia.${prompt};
I spoke with the researchers in Beaucedine on the matter of Sir Louverance.${prompt};
From what I can gather, your friend has most likely been transported to the Rhinostery in the Federation of Windurst.${prompt};
That is good news!;
Thank you, High Priest Chasalvige.;
We will continue our search in the city of Windurst!${prompt};

That's why I've been passing out presents to show them my love. Here, why don't you try it as well?${prompt};
If you want any more love to give to the children, you'll have to buy it. Hey, I've gotta make a living too, you know.${prompt};

<Sigh>... If there isn't a name on this ${item-singular: 1[2]}, how am I supposed to return the favor?${prompt};
I knew it! Those little ones have been my favorites since I arrived in San d'Oria.${prompt};
You know, you ought to try bringing joy to the children of Vana'diel yourself. Here, you can have this hat.${prompt};
Wear it, and all the kids will know that you're here to deliver love!${prompt};
Really!;
Acts of kindness like this always fill my heart up with this feeling...this feeling that I just can't explain. I'll have to go find those children and give 'em an extra-special present!${prompt};
When is that crazy craftsman going to come and pick up his materials, kupo...?${prompt};
Boy, am I glad to see you! I've been waiting forever for someone to pick up these supplies, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure that you have the time to be chatting here with me, kupo?${prompt};
Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?${prompt};
Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!${prompt};
You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.${prompt};
This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.${prompt};
But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!${prompt};
It's just not fair, kupo!${prompt};
Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!${prompt};
And that's why we need your help, kupo!;
Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?${prompt};
There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!${prompt};
For starters, why don't you try finding ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!${prompt};
Great! A whole set, kupo!;
Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole.;
Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo!;
We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!${prompt};
Wow! Another set!;
You don't know how much this means to us, kupo!;
Here, take this!${prompt};
You hand the clerk the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${number: 1} gil, and your set of armor is returned.${prompt};

The Doll Festival has started, kupo!${prompt};
I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.${prompt};
Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.${prompt};
Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well?;
We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!${prompt};
It looks like you have all the members you need.;
Time for the festival to begin, kupo!${prompt};
After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival.;
Here, you take one as well, kupo!${prompt};
It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!${prompt};
In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!${prompt};
As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, “resourcefulness,” I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!${prompt};
Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress.;
Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!${prompt};
And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor.;
I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo!?;
Something's not right...;
Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!${prompt};

Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!;
Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt};
You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.;
Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hey!;
Your party has different members all of a sudden!;
Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt};
Hey!;
Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!;
You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt};
Hmm...;
You seem to have lost your male element.;
Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt};
What is this? Can't you see that I'm busy?;
...;
Albanus? Bells? Alloys?${prompt};
Eh? That hag Reinberta told you I could help?;
Here, let me see that scroll...${prompt};
Hmph. All this fancy jade... Reinberta would like something as useless as this. A good old iron clasp, now that's all you need. Sturdy, inexpensive, and practical, let me tell you...${prompt};
Ahem... Now, what does this Albanus character have to say...?${prompt};
Hm...;
Hrm...;
So that is what he means...${prompt};
It seems that the alloy our bellmaker is speaking of in his diary and on this scroll is Minstrel Metal.${prompt};
What? You've never heard of it? Well, of course you haven't. The method for making it has been lost for decades.${prompt};
Minstrel Metal receives its name from the enchanting sound that it emits when struck.${prompt};
The tones are so beautiful, that it was said people would come from around the Kingdom just to hear the ballads created during the alloy's forging.${prompt};
I believe that this scroll illustrates the lost method of smelting Minstrel Metal...but it is all written in some strange code. I can only guess the author did not want anyone to steal his techniques.${prompt};
But if that author really was Albanus, then the cryptic message would make some sense.${prompt};
You see, I have heard tales of the eccentric young bellmaker...${prompt};
Once, long ago, there was a novice goldsmith named Albanus who spent day and night studying the art of bellmaking. He was quite a prodigy, people said.${prompt};
Most of the time, the young man would lock himself up in his room behind the guild and pound away at his Minstrel Metal, until one day a strange boy called upon Albanus.${prompt};
The boy said he had been drawn to the “voices of the angels,” and asked if he could stay with Albanus.${prompt};
At first the bellmaker was puzzled, but soon grew fond of the boy and his appreciation of Albanus's work. And though he himself was still an amateur, he allowed the boy to become his pupil, and proceeded to teach him the ways of smithing.${prompt};
However, it turned out that the pupil did more teaching than the master. The boy began telling Albanus how he was to create his bells, and it was not long before the boy's influence was heard in the song that rang forth from the novice goldsmith's workshop.${prompt};
But then one day, the sound stopped. Just as suddenly as the strange boy had appeared, he had vanished, and along with him, young Albanus...${prompt};
Some say that the zealous bellmaker simply left on a journey to discover new materials and techniques...${prompt};
...While others say it was the boy that forced Albanus to leave...${prompt};
They say that he had found a way inside Albanus's mind and made him go mad...${prompt};
But if you ask me, I don't think it was either.;
You see, the job of an artist is to move the hearts of the masses.${prompt};
However, when an artist becomes too attached to his own work, strange things can begin to occur.${prompt};
Eh? You still don't understand what I'm trying to say?${prompt};
Haven't you been listening at all!?${prompt};
When an artist spends his whole life working on something, a part of his soul is sometimes transferred to the piece.${prompt};
I cannot fully explain the existence of these newborn “spirits,” but there are many who believe in them.${prompt};
However, one thing I can be certain of is this--if the boy who led poor Albanus away was truly born from a raw form of the bellmaker's passion, then he may be quite dangerous...${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt};
We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!;
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt};
Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.;
They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt};
Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt};
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt};
I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!;
Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
With all the aura you've absorbed with the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, we've managed to create a new weapon.;
We'd like you to have it, kupo!${prompt};
Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt};
We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt};
Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt};
But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt};
If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt};
Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!;
Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt};
It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt};
We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt};
We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt};
Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt};
There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt};
You'll help us out, kupo?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a try.;
I have other things to do.${prompt};
Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.${prompt};
This card is addressed to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, kupo!${prompt};
This card is addressed to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, kupo!${prompt};
I've been waiting!;
I've got a present for you, kupo!${prompt};
I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!${prompt};
I need you to give this card to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!${prompt};
I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!${prompt};
Did you hand out the ${item-singular: 0[2]} yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.${prompt};
You forgot who to give the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to?;
You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!${prompt};
Let me tell you the key to making the children of Vana'diel happy.${prompt};
You have to give them presents! That much should be obvious. I won't tell you what to give them, though. You've got to use your head for that!${prompt};
Oh yeah, before you start handing out gifts, you also have to wear one of these red hats like the one I've got on. That'll prove that you're a smilebringer! No kid will trust you without it!${prompt};
A while ago, I saw a moogle carrying a huge bag full of hats like this...;
Maybe they're selling them somewhere. You should find out for yourself! That's all I have to say!${prompt};
${choice: 1}[You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You've done fairly well./You've made the children very happy!/You've brought lots of smiles!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] ${choice: 1}[What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]${prompt};
You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!${prompt};
Transport to another nation?;
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
Go to San d'Oria.;
Go to Bastok.;
Go to Windurst.${prompt};
Have a nice trip!${prompt};
Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!${prompt};

Let's talk about jobs.;
Let's talk about appearances.;
I need ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
I'll be going, then.${prompt};
Okay, then. See ya!${prompt};
Then I'll be leaving. See you around.${prompt};

Yes, that would help.;
Not really.${prompt};
Which do you recommend?;

Shield style.;

Soothing healer style.${prompt};
Time for a change?;
${selection-lines};
You betcha.;
It's fine how it is.${prompt};
I was wondering if you'd seen that child we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis.;
Is she keeping out of trouble?${prompt};
Is the little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis doing okay?;
Just wondering...${prompt};
You remember that little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis?;
I was just worried...ah, never mind.${prompt};
Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis?;
There's something that's been bothering me...${prompt};
The girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis...;
Have you seen her since then? I'm just a little worried, that's all.${prompt};
By the way, do you remember the young lady we saved in Eldieme Necropolis?;
Such a fragile little thing... I hope she's okay.${prompt};
I wonder how the little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis is doing.;
I was just thinking about it.${prompt};
So, have you seen the little girl we found crying in the Eldieme Necropolis lately?;
Just wondering how she was doing.${prompt};
How is the young girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis doing?;
Hope she's staying out of trouble...${prompt};
You remember that adorable little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis, don't you?;
I wonder if she's doing okay.${prompt};
Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis lately?;
There's something that's been bothering me...${prompt};
Do you remember the young girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis?;
If you see her, tell her she shouldn't be wandering outside town alone.${prompt};
I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba.;
What was it even doing there? Does it have something to do with that mirror?${prompt};
Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba?;
What on Vana'diel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?${prompt};
About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba...;
Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?${prompt};
There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba.;
Why was it there, I wonder...${prompt};
Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba?;
It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.${prompt};
The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call.;
I'm sure glad I showed up when I did.${prompt};
Why was that dragon in Ghelsba?;
I hope it doesn't foreshadow something worse...${prompt};
I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba.;
Was it after the mirror, maybe?${prompt};
Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba?;
It's strange that such a creature would be found there...${prompt};
Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba?;
I mean, besides the one we fought...${prompt};
There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba.;
Why was it there, I wonder...${prompt};
The dragon we fought in Ghelsba does not belong there.;
I suspect a sinister hand behind its presence.${prompt};

I haven't really thought much about jobs.;
What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?${prompt};
Jobs?;
I'll try anything once.;
What style of combat do you recommend?${prompt};
I'm not that interested in jobs.;
Give me a style of combat and I'll stick to that.${prompt};
There are so many jobs to choose from.;
Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt};
What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?${prompt};
Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.${prompt};
I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is.;
Do you have any particular style you want me to use?${prompt};
No matter the job, I can fight in any style!;
Is there a particular style you recommend?${prompt};
Jobs?;
If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me.;
What kind of combat style do you recommend?${prompt};
I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?${prompt};
There are so many jobs to choose from.;
Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt};
You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?${prompt};
Hmm.;
I'll give it a shot.${prompt};
Right!;
That's the style for me!${prompt};
Hmm.;
I'll try it.${prompt};
Okay.;
I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt};
Okay then.;
I'll start doing that from next time.${prompt};
Sounds good! Leave it to me!${prompt};
Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.${prompt};
Okay!;
Sounds like fun!${prompt};
Really?;
Okay, I'll try it out.${prompt};
Hmmm. Okay!;

Huh!?;

Yes?;

What are you staring at?;
Don't you like my headwear?${prompt};
Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt};
My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.${prompt};
Well, I guess I could wear something else.${prompt};
Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.${prompt};
I'll change it, then.${prompt};
Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt};
Thanks. I'll try this one.${prompt};
Ooh, I like your style!${prompt};
Okay, I'll change it for you.${prompt};
Well, okay.;
A change is as good as a holiday!${prompt};

Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!${prompt};
Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt};
Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.${prompt};
I'll forget you said anything, then.${prompt};
Oh?;
Okay.${prompt};
Well, that's a relief.${prompt};
I'll stay the way I am, then.${prompt};
So I don't need to change it?;
Fashion can be so frustrating...${prompt};
You like me just the way I am, eh?${prompt};

Oh?;

With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.;
I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt};
Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?;
I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!${prompt};
Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?;
Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt};
You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.;
The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt};
Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?;
An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...${prompt};
Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?;
And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt};
Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.;
You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt};
Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...${prompt};
Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.;
Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt};
I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats?;
Do archdukes eat curry...?${prompt};
You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.;
The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt};
My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno.;
Most likely the part that would form the main body...${prompt};
Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.;
A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.${prompt};
Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!;
Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt};
If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.;
I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt};
Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt};
Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.;
At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.${prompt};
A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out.;
I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt};
The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.;
No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt};
How embarrassing...;
I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt};
Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.;
Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt};
Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?;
What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt};
Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt};
That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--;
A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt};
Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt};
Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?;
No...?${prompt};
I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.;
Bastok is a weird place...${prompt};
I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.;
He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt};
How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?;
I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt};
I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt};
I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt};
I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt};
I've never eaten a treant bulb before.;
What do they taste like?${prompt};
Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?;
What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt};
I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.;
He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt};
The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt};
In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.;
I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt};
I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.;
You should be careful!${prompt};
Windurst truly is a magical nation.;
I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.;
The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt};
Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?;
Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt};
Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt};
Windurst is famous for its hat shop.;
I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt};
The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.;
Are they not for sale?${prompt};
The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.;
I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt};
There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.;
What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?;
It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt};
Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.;
The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt};
A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt};
When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt};
I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.;
I have my license, though. Really.${prompt};
Hmm.;
I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt};
It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt};
Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt};
Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt};
The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt};
Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt};
I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.;
The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt};
Are moogles considered to be beastmen?;
Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt};
It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt};
The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt};
I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.;
Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt};
And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?;
Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt};
...;
Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.;
Not very interesting at all.${prompt};
Do you notice the change?;
I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt};
There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt};
The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.;
Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt};
The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!;
My best dress, ruined!${prompt};
But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.;
And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt};
I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt};
I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt};
Do you notice the change?;
I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt};
Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt};
No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt};
I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt};
I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt};
Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt};
I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt};
I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt};
Have you ever seen an aurora?;
It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt};
I never know what to wear on windy days.;
I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt};
I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.;
What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt};
The smilebringers really exist, you know!;
They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt};
Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt};
In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt};
I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.;
Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt};
For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.;
Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt};
Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?;
Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt};
You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt};
But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt};
Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt};
I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.;
You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt};
Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt};
Do they trade with people?;
I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt};
They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.;
You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt};
But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.;
After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt};
You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.;
I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt};
I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt};
There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.;
We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt};
It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.;
No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt};
I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt};
You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt};
You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt};
Do you eat out much?${prompt};
I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt};
What do you keep in your Mog House?;
Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt};
It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.;
No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt};
I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt};
I have a friend in the business, you see.;
I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt};
The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt};
Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.;
Why don't we train together?${prompt};
I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt};
To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt};
M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!;
It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt};
Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt};
Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.;
Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt};
I have as many as four different sets worked out...;
I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt};
It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?;
Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt};
I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt};
What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...${prompt};

Is there something that'll suit me?${prompt};
Ooh, you wanna coordinate my attire for me?${prompt};
I think I look good in most things, but give me your honest opinion on which would suit me best.${prompt};
Oh, so much to choose from!;
You pick for me!${prompt};

I've got a pile of spares, so there's no need to worry!${prompt};
Oh? Not a bad choice.;

Nice!;

Hmph... Remind me not to ask your opinion again.${prompt};

I don't want to interrupt your other adventuring activities, so just come along when you're ready.${prompt};

That ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding, is that about combat styles?;

Might I take a look?${prompt};
What's that? Hey, isn't that ${item-singular: 1[2]} about combat styles?;
Can I have a look?${prompt};
How did you come by an unusual item like that?;
Wait a minute. That ${item-singular: 1[2]}...isn't it about combat styles? Mind if I sneak a peek?${prompt};
Hm? Is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding about combat styles?;

Hey, is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding about combat styles?;
Don't be a hog, hand it over!${prompt};

Might I take a look?${prompt};
Hm? How did you come to be in possession of that ${item-singular: 1[2]}? Go on, show it to me.${prompt};
Hmm, that made a lot of sense.;
Let me know if you find any more of these.${prompt};
That was pretty informative stuff.;
If you find any more manuals like that, let me know!${prompt};
Hmm. There's a lot more to combat than I thought.;
Let me know if you find any more manuals like that.${prompt};
A fascinating read.;
Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.${prompt};
Wow, so much I never knew...;
If you have any more of these, please show them to me!${prompt};
Nope, never seen this one before.;
Uh-huh... So you're supposed to do this, and then--ah, I got it! Be sure to let me know if you come across any others, okay?${prompt};
Well, that cleared up a few things for me.;
Let me know if you find any similar books.${prompt};
Wow!;
I never knew there was still so much to learn!;
If you find any more of these, you know where to bring them!${prompt};
Hmm...interesting.;
I'd appreciate it if you brought me any more of these you happened to find.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I think I understood most of it.;
Let me know if you find any more of these, okay?${prompt};
A fascinating read.;
Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.${prompt};
This is remarkable content indeed...;
I never knew such a combat style existed. Should you obtain any other such texts, bring them to me without delay.${prompt};
Your adventuring fellow has learned a new combat style!${prompt};

If it's what you want to do, ${name-player}, I'll help you fix the mirror.${prompt};
I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;

I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;
It's kind of exciting!${prompt};
I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;
I just hope that nothing terrible happens...${prompt};
I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;
I'm a little scared, to be perfectly honest...${prompt};
I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired.;
Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.${prompt};
So the fate of that mirror has fallen into our hands...;
First, we must seek the items Luto spoke of.${prompt};

Six items in all.${prompt};
What a pain!${prompt};
Sounds delicious.${prompt};
Where do we start?${prompt};
This may require some serious legwork.${prompt};
Is the Tarutaru digestive system linked to a fourth dimension?${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
There's some secret we're missing here.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
All this talk of mystery is making me hungry...${prompt};
Glass of Blessed Radiance...;
What connection could it have to the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?${prompt};
“The Lost Looking Glass”...;
Now there's a book I should like to read.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
Could there also be an opposing entity to the Glass of All-Seeing?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
I can't help but wonder if there's a reason for there being two mirrors.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
Sounds kind of romantic.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;

What powers does the other one have?${prompt};
“The Lost Looking Glass”...;
Now there's a book I should like to read.${prompt};
The Glass of Blessed Radiance...and the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.;
The contrasting names suggest much, but reveal little.${prompt};
Palometa has had a difficult time, it seems.;
I hope we can help her out.${prompt};
Palometa is a brave little girl.;
I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!${prompt};
Palometa is an unusual child...;
The daughter of the guardian...${prompt};
It seems that Palometa is the true owner of the mirror.;
I hope for her sake we can locate that unusual metal...${prompt};
So the mirror belonged to Palometa.;
I hope we can fix it.${prompt};
All this is too much for young Palometa to handle alone.;
Let's do what we can to help the little lady!${prompt};
Poor Palometa has had it rough.;
We should do all we can to support her.${prompt};
Palometa is a brave little girl.;
I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!${prompt};
Palometa...;
It must have been scary for her.;
Let's make sure she stays safe.${prompt};
Poor little Palometa.;

It seems that Palometa is the true owner of the mirror.;
I hope for her sake we can locate that unusual metal...${prompt};
Palometa has reasons best known to herself.;

Come one, come all, kupo!${prompt};
Love is in the air!;
It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!${prompt};
There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!${prompt};
Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that “special someone”!${prompt};
We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!${prompt};
Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.${prompt};
There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!${prompt};
When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.${prompt};
You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.${prompt};
Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.${prompt};
When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.${prompt};
If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!${prompt};
Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo～.${prompt};
We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!${prompt};
Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!${prompt};
After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!${prompt};
While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho～!${prompt};
Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!${prompt};
Want to try again?;
Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!${prompt};
Something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Something wrong?;
${selection-lines};
Listen to the rules again.;
Give up.;
Not really.${prompt};
Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
You aren't planning on giving up, are you?${prompt};
Quit the game?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.${prompt};
Really give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes!;
No, not yet!${prompt};
Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo?;
You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings!;
...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?${prompt};
You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
What a beautiful piece of chocolate!;
No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!${prompt};
Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...${prompt};
Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!${prompt};
Decent. You score ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.${prompt};
Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.${prompt};
My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!${prompt};
Which item would you like?;
${selection-lines};
Let me think.;
Are you absolutely sure, kupo?${prompt};
You really want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, that's the one!;
On second thought...${prompt};
You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.${prompt};
You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!${prompt};
Oh, I've been waiting for this moment!;
You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!${prompt};
Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!${prompt};
You still haven't brought any chocolate?;
I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!${prompt};
Hey, what do you want?;
You could go see a moogle or something!${prompt};
<gasp>!;
Y-you brought me a chocolate!;
I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!${prompt};
Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.${prompt};
Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like ${choice: 3}[Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.${prompt};
What? Still...?;
Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.${prompt};
What do you want?;
I don't think I know you.${prompt};
Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all.;
I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.${prompt};
I have been waiting all my life for this!;
You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!${prompt};
Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest] ${choice: 3}[Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!${prompt};
Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!${prompt};
What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!${prompt};
Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me!;
I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live ${choice-player-gender}[girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!${prompt};
N-no way!;
I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!${prompt};
Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!${prompt};
Ahhh!;
By Altana, you scared me!;
Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!${prompt};
What!?;
...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!${prompt};
Ahhh!;
You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!${prompt};
Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!${prompt};
Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!${prompt};
What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!${prompt};
Hm? Want something?;
You should go talk to a moogle!${prompt};
Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!${prompt};
Why, hello!;
This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.${prompt};
Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!${prompt};
Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful!;
But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!${prompt};
Yes? You have a question?;
Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!${prompt};
Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much!;
I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it.;
I hope you meet someone special, too!${prompt};
Aaah!;
Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is...;
<sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!${prompt};
A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)${prompt};
Eep!;
Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know!;
Anyway, good luck!${prompt};
Y-yes? What is it?;
I...um, I don't need anything...${prompt};
What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!${prompt};
Hello...;
I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...${prompt};
Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.${prompt};
You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you?;
I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...${prompt};
What's the matter?;
I don't think there's anything I need...${prompt};
I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
Such blasphemy in our Goddess-blessed nation...;
Is that not a symbol of those heathens?${prompt};
The people of Aht Urhgan put their faith in false gods.;
You should be ashamed of yourself.${prompt};
Yes, I know of the badge you wear.${prompt};
I was in the port when the Brugaire Consortium was unloading a large shipment of the things.${prompt};
I wonder if even the Brugaire Consortium goes too far, sometimes.;
This strange foreign cargo will land them in deep water with the Temple Knights, you mark my words.${prompt};
Have you heard much about the company distributing those badges?${prompt};
Their headquarters are in a Near Eastern town called “Al Zahbi.”;
Rumor has it that the company president is something of a miser.${prompt};
What could they possibly want with San d'Oria?;
You may want to think twice before clipping on one of those things.${prompt};
The other day I saw a man wandering around town wearing the most unusual clothing.;
Is there some festival I am not aware of?${prompt};
How could you possibly not have heard?;
The Near Eastern folk are recruiting soldiers on a massive scale to quell some war that is raging with the beastmen.${prompt};
You cannot be serious!;
Do you mean to tell me that another frightful Crystal War once more threatens our fair home?${prompt};
There is no need to be so dramatic, Anilla.;
The Near East is not quite so near as to warrant an immediate descent into panic and despair.;
The only people this news pertains to are those action-hungry adventurers.${prompt};
Speaking of which, I had one of those unruly brutes burst into my home while I was dusting, and proceed to boast about some badge he'd received...${prompt};
Simply unforgivable. If one must brag of some possession so badly, one should at least observe the common courtesy of knocking...${prompt};
Oh my, I thought a shooting star had crossed my vision for a moment there.;
I believe I just made a wish on your badge, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/madame].${prompt};
It comes from the Near East, you say?;
Such a captivating shine it has.;
I wonder if the stars in that nation burn as brightly as they do here? Perhaps I shall go and see for myself...${prompt};
Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!${prompt};
We've got items for everyone!;
Here you go, kupo!${prompt};
Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!${prompt};
You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
You obtain ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 2[2]}, and ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}!${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt};
The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!;
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopo!;
The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!${prompt};
And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!${prompt};
Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt};
Want to know more?;
${selection-lines};
Fill me in!;
I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt};
To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt};
So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt};
Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt};
We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt};
The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt};
What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt};
And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt};
Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt};
But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt};
And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt};
So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt};
Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt};
You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt};
Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt};
Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt};
Is this partner okay with you?;
${selection-lines};
Perfect!;
I want to go with someone else...${prompt};
Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo?;
Where'd your partner go?${prompt};
I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt};
I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt};
Kupopo! Congratulations!;
You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt};
Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt};
We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt};
It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt};
Leave town?;
${selection-lines};
Send me out!;
Not yet...${prompt};
Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt};
Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt};
If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt};
I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt};
Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.;
If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt};
What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt};
Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt};
Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};
Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.;
You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt};
What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt};
Start over?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No thanks.${prompt};
You there.;
I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?${prompt};
Have you heard?;
${selection-lines};
Ghosts!?;
Yes, I've heard.${prompt};
Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt};
Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Allow me to explain.;
I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt};
I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt};
The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt};
These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt};
When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt};
And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt};
The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.;
I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt};
That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt};
I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt};
Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt};
Will you help?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt};
Ahaha...;
How droll.;
Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt};
Most excellent.;
There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt};
These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt};
If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt};
I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt};
The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt};
Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt};
Good luck.${prompt};
Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?;
What of the spirit...?${prompt};
I see...;
So that is her purpose...${prompt};
The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt};
I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt};
You have been a great help.;
Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt};
This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.;
Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.;
Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt};
However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt};
What has befallen you?;
Do you wish to give up?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
I'm done.;
Not yet.${prompt};
A pity.;
Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt};
Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt};
Ah, you're back!;
Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt};
Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt};
The second spirit is called Guwanana.;
She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt};
Good day!;
I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt};
I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt};
I'll get straight to the point.;
Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt};
Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.;
Let me give you the short version:${prompt};
I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt};
For what?;
I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.;
You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt};
But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt};
They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt};
The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”;
That's not a language I can understand.${prompt};
That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.;
Then I can find a weakness.${prompt};
That's where you come in...${prompt};
I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt};
Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt};
What do you say?;
Will you help?${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.;
I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt};
Thank you!;
There is one thing you should know...${prompt};
These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.;
If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt};
But don't give up if they catch on to you.;
Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt};
I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt};
The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.;
I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt};
Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
So that's why...${prompt};
It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.;
The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt};
It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt};
Oh, and this is for you.${prompt};
It's a witch hat.;
The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.;
Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt};
If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt};
Giving up the ghost?${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.;
I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt};
Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt};
You know what?;
I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt};
What do you think?${prompt};
Your target's name is Pretty Heart.;
Wonder why he's called that...${prompt};
Really?;
I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt};
Hi, I'm Gertrude.;
I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.;
Have you heard anything?${prompt};
You have?;
Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt};
Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt};
No?;
Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt};
I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt};
A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt};
But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt};
In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt};
Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt};
In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt};
The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt};
And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt};
Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt};
Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.;
Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
Wonderful.;
There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt};
These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt};
If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.;
They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt};
According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt};
The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.;
I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt};
Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.;
There are many preparations to be made.${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
How did you fare...?${prompt};
I see, so that's why she...${prompt};
However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt};
I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt};
Your help has been invaluable.;
Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt};
It's a witch hat.;
Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt};
If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt};
What's wrong?;
Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt};
Oh, I see...;
Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt};
Then I would ask you to return to your task.;
Good luck.${prompt};
Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt};
I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt};
Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.;
Please be careful...${prompt};
You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.;
Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt};
I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.;
Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt};
I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt};
You...you're no monster!${prompt};
You...you're no monster!${prompt};
You...you're no monster!${prompt};
You...you're no monster!${prompt};
So pretty...the fountain is still so...${prompt};
That must be...the chateau...;
And over there...the cathedral...${prompt};
I never thought...to return here...${prompt};
Every morning...I watched him training...from afar...;
If only...I had had the courage...${prompt};
No...he was a Hume...;
I...am a witch...;
If I were...to confess...${prompt};
And then...there was the lunch...he always carried...;
Someone...must have made it...for him...${prompt};
He passed...without ever knowing...;
But I...am still here...${prompt};
I...;
I should no longer care...;
I want to forget...${prompt};
The fountain where he took his rest...;
The stones that grew wet with his tears...;
Nothing has changed...except me...${prompt};
The moat where he swam...;
The shade where he slept...;
It is still the same...${prompt};
Ah...I know you are there...;
But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...${prompt};
This moat...where I fell in...${prompt};
I slipped...on the bridge...;
I fell...${prompt};
He was always there...;
I didn't notice...${prompt};
From the time that I was small...;
Always there to save me...${prompt};
Even when I was loathed and feared...;
You were there to praise my power...${prompt};
My brother...${prompt};
But I...I was always angry...;
I even forgot the lunch you made...${prompt};
But here...;
I want to tell you just once...${prompt};
Thank you...;
Thank you for being there...for me...${prompt};
Your lunches...always made with so much care...${prompt};
I see you there...;
Listening to me... I should curse you...;
But I will forgive you...as my brother would...${prompt};
These trees...;
I burned with the Fire spell...;
Yet they have grown back...${prompt};
This stream...;
I froze with Blizzaga II...;
Yet now it flows...${prompt};
This building...;
I toppled with Aeroga III...;
Yet it has been rebuilt...${prompt};
The wall of the Metalworks...;
I cracked with Thunder IV...;
Yet it has been repaired...${prompt};
It is as if...I never existed...;
Have my sins...also been erased...?${prompt};
My magic...has always been overpowerful...;
The cold stares...of the townspeople...${prompt};
I learned my spells...for vengeance...;
People called me...heartless...${prompt};
I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...${prompt};
Then why...?;
Why do I feel so at home here...?${prompt};
Why...?;
Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?${prompt};
You...I see you...;
Cease your stalking...;
I wish to be alone...${prompt};
A genius...is never understood...by the masses...${prompt};
A genius...is isolated...from the common people...${prompt};
A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...${prompt};
I wanted to save her...;
The girl with astounding talent...${prompt};
To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...${prompt};
The Dark Lilies...;
A coven of...chosen...;
A sanctuary...for witches...${prompt};
Yet...I wonder...;
Was it all...for the best...?;
To leave...this world behind...?${prompt};
Was she...truly happy...?;
Being enveloped...in the darkness...?${prompt};
I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time...;
In this town...the town I had forsaken...${prompt};
I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found...;
In this town...that I once loved...${prompt};
You...go back...;
Back to the exorcist...;
Tell him...I am ready...to leave...${prompt};
This...was a secret place...${prompt};
A place...that nobody knew...${prompt};
The perrrfect spot...${prompt};
An enchanted spot...;
So many fish...;
They would just jump...onto the hook...${prompt};
To fill...my empty belly...${prompt};
To help...my strrruggling mother...${prompt};
I would fish...and fish...and fish...;
We were poor...I had no other choice...${prompt};
Even so...those days were fun...;
But I hated...being poor...;
I delved...into forbidden magic...${prompt};
I'm sorry...Mother...;
The day...I left home...;
I wanted...wanted to tell you...${prompt};
I'm sorry...;
I brrroke my prrromise...to lead an honest life...;
I wanted...wanted to tell you...${prompt};
Enough...;
You have learned my secret...;
Leave me in peace...${prompt};
Glimmer...shimmer...;
Shimmer...glimmer...${prompt};
Little fishies...;
Shimmering fishy-wishies...;
Where have you gone...?${prompt};
Little fishies...;
Glimmering fishy-wishies...;
Are you here...?${prompt};
You mustaru be here...;
You mustaru be hiding...${prompt};
Here and there...;
The fishy-wishies I let free...;
Shimmering...glimmering...fish...${prompt};
But...I don'taru see you...?;
Where have you gone...?${prompt};
The same as before...;
Nowhere to be found...${prompt};
But wait...;
That...shimmer-glimmering...;
The Flash spell fused into your scaly-wales...${prompt};
Glimmer...shimmer...;
So many little fishy-wishies...;
You survived...${prompt};
Shimmer...glimmer...;
So many little fishy-wishies...;
You swim...and glide...${prompt};
Are you satisfied...?;
Then hushy-wush and leave...;
You'll scare the fishy-wishies...${prompt};
You hear a voice speaking softly...${prompt};
Trick or treat?;
I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!${prompt};
What a wonderful witch hat, kupo!;
Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!${prompt};
Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple ${color: 5}cheers${color: 1}!${prompt};
We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is ${color: 5}cheer${color: 1} us along!${prompt};
Bad tree! Bad tree!;
Thanks, everybody!;
Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!${prompt};
10000... 15000... 30000!;
The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!${prompt};
Unnnnnngh... Bad tree!;
We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!${prompt};
Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!${prompt};
The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...${prompt};
Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.${prompt};
However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...${prompt};
I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the “other” smilebringers...${prompt};
I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...${prompt};
I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?${prompt};
You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?${prompt};
You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt};
I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.${prompt};
You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt};
Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...${prompt};
Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.${prompt};
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.${prompt};
There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.${prompt};
I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?${prompt};
I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.${prompt};
Who the kewpo are you, kewpo?;
I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!${prompt};
Ummm...;
I can explaining, kewpo...${prompt};
Just not today!;
Kew-pooooooooo!${prompt};
Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?${prompt};
Uh-huh...;
So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt};
One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.${prompt};
I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!${prompt};
What?;
You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?${prompt};
Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.${prompt};
Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.${prompt};
Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory${prompt};
Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.${prompt};
Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?${prompt};
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.${prompt};
Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?${prompt};
Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.${prompt};
One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.${prompt};
But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe.;
Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!${prompt};
Kupopopo～!;
This is terrible!;
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};
But never fear!;
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};
And that's not all!;
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};
Well done!;
On to the next one, kupo!${prompt};
That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt};
Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!;
If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt};
Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};
The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt};
The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt};
Present ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You stand before Chateau d'Oraguille. If you've no business here, begone!${prompt};
A letter for Monarlais Halver?${prompt};
The penmanship is atrocious...;
I cannot make out the addressee.${prompt};
Let me see that.${prompt};
The sender is...${prompt};
No, this is just as illegible as the rest!;
You! Who is this letter from?${prompt};
Who is it from?;
${selection-lines};
Prince Trion.;
Sage Raillefal.;
The mercenary Raillefal.${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
A member of the royal family would never have such abominable penmanship!${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
A sage, you say? They write in characters that we simple folk cannot decipher...${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
Well, we must do the mercenary's bidding now, mustn't we?${prompt};
But if this letter is truly meant for Monarlais Halver as you say, then we must see that he receives it....${prompt};
I have it!;
I shall deliver this letter myself.;
We cannot allow riffraff from the gutter to simply waltz into the chateau.${prompt};
But I will take your name for the records, of course.${prompt};
${name-player}, is it?${wait-36: 1};
Wait here.${prompt};
You there!;
That letter of yours drained the color from Monarlais Halver's face!${prompt};
Come with me!${prompt};
Wow, I've never heard that before. You know everything, Grandpa!${prompt};
Huh? Oh, a customer!;
Happy New Year!${prompt};
What? Who was I talking to just now? Oh, the other day, this really nice old man gave me my very own ${item-singular: 0[2]} so I could call him whenever I wanted. He teaches me all sorts of things, and all I have to do is call him “Grandpa” and do whatever he says.${prompt};
Just now, he was telling me about the fun-loving people walking around outside.;
I heard that something similar to this happened many years ago...${prompt};
He also told me that if I give 'em something, they'll give me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in return.;
I really wanted one, so I was all ready to go through that gate over there when the guard gave me a nasty loxok...${prompt};
Hey. You're an adventurer, right? Doesn't Altana say that you guys have to help little kids or your brain will melt and bugs will eat your ears? Go out and get me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ASAP. Don't worry, you'll get your reward!${prompt};
Whoa! You really brought me back ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Thanks!${prompt};
I guess you'll be wanting your reward now, huh? Hmmm... How about I give you a choice?${prompt};
I'll...;
${selection-lines};
Let you ask Grandpa a question.;
Give you something from my pocket.;
Tell you more about Grandpa.${prompt};
Eh? That's all you want?;
Well, okay.${prompt};
Hold on. I'll see if I can get through. Grandpa has a lot of little friends just like me, so his line is always busy.${prompt};
Oh, hi Grandpa!;
Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Sure... Uh-huh... Yeah... Okay... Sure... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... No, but... Yeah... Okay... Uh-huh... Right... Uh-huh... Not really... Sure... Okay... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... I can do that... Uh-huh... Great... Yeah... Sure... Uh-huh... No... Not today... Maybe tomorrow... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Wait... Actually, the reason I called was because there is this adventurer who wants to ask you a question.${prompt};
Ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name? Okay.;
${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Lady], what's your name?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} points to the name over ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] head.;
The ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] says ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name is ${name-player}. Think we can believe ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt};
Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...${prompt};
The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.${prompt};
Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some “bravery” and “drive” onto your resume. Go figure!${prompt};
The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.${prompt};
And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.${prompt};
Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.${prompt};
In other words, you're a smart ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!${prompt};
The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.${prompt};
Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.${prompt};
In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.${prompt};
The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.${prompt};
Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!${prompt};
The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.${prompt};
Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.${prompt};
In other words, that “pristine balance” helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!${prompt};
The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.${prompt};
And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!${prompt};
The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.${prompt};
Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.${prompt};
In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!${prompt};
The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.${prompt};
Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!${prompt};
The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.${prompt};
Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!${prompt};
Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.${prompt};
The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.${prompt};
Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.${prompt};
In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!${prompt};
Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!${prompt};
Uh-huh...;
Uh-huh...;
Yeah, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.${prompt};
You want me to tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that, too? Alright.;
Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...${prompt};
Whatever that means. I don't understand half the stuff he says, but I like him because he gives me candy.${prompt};
I knew it. You adventurers are all alike.;
Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.${prompt};
You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.${prompt};
He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some big white contraption...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about it not costing so much when he was younger...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some huge-mongous tree...${prompt};
Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about traveling back and forth...${prompt};
He said the same thing yesterday, so he may still be in the same place. Are you thinking about going and getting some candy, too?${prompt};

Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.${prompt};

All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I require.${prompt};

Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?${prompt};
Stop caring for your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No!${prompt};
You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!${prompt};
You really want to retire your chocobo?${prompt};
Retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.${prompt};
Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!${prompt};
Your chocobo learns Gallop!;

Just let me know if you ever get curious!${prompt};
The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.${prompt};
They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.${prompt};
Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.${prompt};
They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.${prompt};
The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.${prompt};
But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!${prompt};
Ask about which attribute?;
${selection-lines};
Strength.;
Endurance.;
Discernment.;
Receptivity.;
Energy.;
Affection.;
Satisfaction.;
Nothing.${prompt};
“Strength” is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt};
Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt};
“Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt};
Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt};
“Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt};
You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt};
“Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt};
You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt};
If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt};
“Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt};
However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
What is a care schedule?;
Basic care.;
Resting.;
Taking a walk.;
Listening to music.;
Exercising alone.;
Exercising in a group.;
Interacting with children.;
Interacting with chocobos.;
Carrying packages.;
Exhibiting to the public.;
Delivering messages.;
Digging for treasure.;
Acting in a play.;
Nothing.${prompt};
A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt};
How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt};
You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt};
When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt};
With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt};
The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt};
You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt};
The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt};
However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt};
We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt};
Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt};
Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt};
If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt};
However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt};
But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt};
If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt};
The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt};
The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt};
However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt};
You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
A general explanation.;
Watching over your chocobo.;
Telling a story.;
Scolding.;
Competing.;
Taking a walk.;
Nothing.${prompt};
In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt};
On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt};
However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt};
You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt};
Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt};
You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt};
I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt};
Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt};
This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt};
Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt};
I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt};
Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Why feeding is important.;
Vegetables.;
Wildgrasses.;
Carrots.;
Worms.;
Medicines.;
Pastes.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt};
However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt};
The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt};
At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt};
Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt};
There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt};
Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt};
This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt};
Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt};
Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt};
In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt};
Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt};
Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt};
For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt};
But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt};
The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt};
Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt};
A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt};
Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt};
You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt};
Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt};
Which would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Abilities.;
Temperament.;
Weather preferences.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt};
For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt};
Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt};
But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt};
The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt};
Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt};
Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt};
Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt};
You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt};
After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt};
When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt};
You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt};
The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt};
You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt};
When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt};
That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt};
When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};
Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.${prompt};
If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Chococards.;
Nothing.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.${prompt};
With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.${prompt};
If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt};
You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt};
The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt};
Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt};
Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt};
If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt};
Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt};
If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt};

Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been making an awful fuss at night.${prompt};
Chicks have a tendency to cry a lot, but I think this may be worse than normal...${prompt};
${name-player}, could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping soundly at night.${prompt};
I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.${prompt};
I will dispose of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!${prompt};
As you say, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...${prompt};
I gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was but a chick.${prompt};
I am afraid ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust me more than you...${prompt};
You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.${prompt};
I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
You would like to tend to this egg?${prompt};
We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It will not be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
"Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} no longer seems lonely.${prompt};
...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?${prompt};
I am not sure what to say to that!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been behaving quite spoiled as of late. You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wanted attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I am sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love, but it is feeling better now and its appetite has returned. Everything should be all right.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! I wonder what kind of name you will choose...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it awakens.${prompt};
Your chocobo should grow accustomed to its name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We have been taking good care of your egg. I cannot wait to see how the chick will look.${prompt};
We have been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It has been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It appeared to be having pleasant dreams...${prompt};
I took the chocobo on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} exercised with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${wait-35: 8}${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a child...${prompt};
...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}? Oh...oh yes! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. It enjoyed playing to the crowds...${prompt};
However, it got a bit too carried away, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for San d'Oria.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, San d'Oria was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, San d'Oria awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You have earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You would not believe what it has found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but turned up with very few items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but did not seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. You should spend it wisely.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding your egg.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. I have some information to relay to you regarding ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That is all for now. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What brings you here today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let us analyze your egg's current condition...${prompt};
Let us analyze ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s current condition...${prompt};
I cannot tell yet whether the chocobo will be male or female.${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo is...a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};

Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg does not seem to be in the best condition at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can provide it with proper care.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because West Ronfaure is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt}${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The La Theine Plateau is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should not grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Jugner Forest. Being together such a long time should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for San d'Oria, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What is this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?${prompt};
You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I can't do it anymore.;
No, I want to continue.${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?${prompt};
Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?${prompt};
If you decide to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Give up raising your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No!${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
What would you like to say?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
I'm sorry.;
It's just an animal!;
We weren't compatible.;
Take good care of it.${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...${prompt};
Is that so? That is a proper attitude...${prompt};
...;
I am disappointed in you.${prompt};
You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.${prompt};
I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
Are you sure you want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet!${prompt};
Once you retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?${prompt};
Really retire your chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, really!;
No, I've changed my mind!${prompt};
Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.${prompt};
Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, is it not? But have no fear...you can see it again. Keep your chin up.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I shall prepare ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
The preparations will cost ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
I have your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You may take it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I can give you a new one, but it will cost you ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And do not worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I have been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}...;
What is this all about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...${prompt};
The owner's name begins with the letter ${choice: 0}[C/L/V].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[a town information guide/a watchman/someone who delivers parcels/a merchant].${prompt};
I will do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I have gathered new information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up a moment ago. I am glad that we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions.;
Might I trouble you to choose another combination?${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.${prompt};
Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...${prompt};
I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
I think that should be enough. Let me see the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this.${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby.${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is becoming one fine bird, if you ask me!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. You can get one at the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're already raising a chocobo.${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.${prompt};
So you'd like to tend to this egg, eh?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... Let's make a fine chocobo out of this one.${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
Isn't it cute? You can name it later.${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a hassle when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork.${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!${prompt};
You've done a great job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air. You're a natural at this!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal!${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
"But don't worry; this won't be your last meeting.${prompt}";
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. You should probably feed it better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you, eh?${prompt};
...I've got no comment on that.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been waking up every morning as of late.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} in order to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have more zest for life nowadays.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm really sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and I'm happy to say it seems to be fine.${prompt};
I know it had you worried sick, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must've missed you terribly.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I'm sure that would give its spirits a lift.${prompt};
It seems that ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was in love. Everything should be all right now... Its appetite has returned and it appears to be feeling better.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! Have any great ideas?${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up.${prompt};
I am sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time.${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how the chick looks.${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. It's been passing its time here in the stables without concern.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much, it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s been out playing with the children of Bastok. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Eh?;
Oh yeah, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seemed to enjoy it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it.${prompt};
We put your chocobo on exhibition. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really played to the crowds...${prompt};
But it was a little too aggressive, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Bastok.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Bastok was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
However, it got lost several times on the way.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
As a measure of compensation, Bastok awards you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} worked hard, but didn't turn up with many items in the end.${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg.${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I still can't tell whether the chocobo will be male or female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Discernment: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. Your chocobo is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue. You should not disturb it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes, too.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love with another chocobo.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it.${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because North Gustaberg is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Konschtat Highlands are not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Pashhow Marshlands. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Bastok, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's that? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any longer?${prompt};
Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}...;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};
I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt};
I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt};
Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt};
That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt};
Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt};
Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt};
I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt};
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt};
I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt};
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt};
So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt};
We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt};
A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};
It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?${prompt};
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt};
Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt};
And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt};
You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!${prompt};
And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal.${prompt};
But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt};
I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then! From now on, your chocobo will be known as...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Come on, cheer up! This won't be your last meeting!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will come to you whenever you call!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s injury has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be a bit under the weather. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} should fix it right up, though.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s illness has completely healed!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have a stronger stomach these days!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} doesn't seem lonely anymore.${prompt};
Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?${prompt};
Hey, don't look at me for an answer... I don't speak Chocobo, you know!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems pretty perky lately! It should be responsive to anything you give it now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.${prompt};
Wow...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been waking up every morning lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is very ill. We need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to help it.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s fever has gone down.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems really bored! You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems happier lately!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has become more responsive to commands lately.${prompt};
I'm so sorry, but ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away! Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...${prompt};
I think it just wants attention, though...${prompt};
It should come back if we wait a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is back, and it seems okay!${prompt};
I know you were just beside yourself with worry, but you should welcome your chocobo with open arms. It must've missed you a lot!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been acting weird lately. Its head is in the clouds and will hardly eat anything...${prompt};
You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. That should cheer it up!${prompt};
It seems your chocobo was in love! Now it seems cheerful again and is eating like there's no tomorrow, so I guess things are back to normal!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems unusually bright and focused today!;
Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.${prompt};
The time has come to name your chocobo! What'll it be?${prompt};
Oh! Your chocobo likes its new name!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns!${prompt};
Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time!${prompt};
On your marks...;
Get set...;
Go!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
And the winner is...${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
I couldn't take care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} because it ran away...${prompt};
We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how cute the chick will be!${prompt};
We've been taking good care of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Your chocobo has been passing its time here in the stables without a concern in the world!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...${prompt};
I took ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!${prompt};
I played some music for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.${prompt};
I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made it a bit more patient!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out playing with the children of Windurst. Even I felt like a kid again!${prompt};
Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...${prompt};
Oh...oh! Yes, of course, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} enjoyed it too...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...${prompt};
But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been out carrying packages. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.${prompt};
Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of ${number: 1} gil. Take it...you've earned it!${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. Your chocobo really played to the crowds!${prompt};
But it was a little too much sometimes, and ended up making some children cry.${prompt};
We put ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} on exhibition. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.${prompt};
Please accept ${number: 0} gil as a token of our gratitude!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} was sent to deliver official messages for Windurst.${prompt};
Thanks to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, Windurst was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...${prompt};
But it got lost sooo many times!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.${prompt};
Windurst compensates you with ${number: 0} gil. You've earned it!${prompt};
Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} dug for hours, but it hardly found anything!${prompt};
In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play. It was great! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} recently appeared in a play, but it didn't even know its role! It just caused trouble for the other actors.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been appearing in plays recently. In ${number: 2} out of ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.${prompt};
The playmaster offers ${number: 0} gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg!${prompt};
There you are, ${name-player}! I've got something I want to tell you about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
That's about it for now. What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}! What are you here for today?${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Let's see how your egg is doing today...${prompt};
Let's see how ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is doing today...${prompt};
I can't tell yet whether your chocobo will be a male or a female...${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be a ${choice-chocobo-gender: 0[2]}[male/female]!${prompt};
Strength: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Endurance: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Discernment: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Receptivity: ${choice: 0}[Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]${prompt};
Regarding affection, it seems to ${choice: 1}[not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].${prompt};
Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be ${choice: 1}[starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].${prompt};
It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.${prompt};
Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it heal.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is very ill. ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} might help it feel better.${prompt};
Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.${prompt};
Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is so full of energy today!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is unusually bright and focused today!${prompt};
It ${choice: 1}[has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it ${choice: 1}[easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].${prompt};
Your chocobo ${choice: 1}[likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.]${choice: 1}[./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days/ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]${prompt};
Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities “${choice: 1}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]” and “${choice: 2}[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder].”${prompt};
Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care!${prompt};
Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} needs more energy before you can take care of it!${prompt};
If you watch over ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, it will gradually return your affection.${prompt};
Telling ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.${prompt};
When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you should discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love!${prompt};
You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing!${prompt};
Well, it is good for their physical development, after all... I guess it's alright as long as they don't fight.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because East Sarutabaruta is nearby, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow very tired.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Tahrongi Canyon is not too far, so ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} shouldn't grow exhausted.${prompt};
You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Meriphataud Mountains. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.${prompt};
You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.${prompt};
If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.${prompt};
Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.${prompt};
Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.${prompt};
You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.${prompt};
Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with some gil as thanks for this service.${prompt};
Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Windurst, which will compensate you for your services.${prompt};
Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};
What's this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};
What's this? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any more?${prompt};
What? You want to stop raising ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} at a time like this?${prompt};
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you'll never ever see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again! You really don't mind?${prompt};
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Do you have anything you have to say for yourself?${prompt};
I guess if that's what you really want... Custody of ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for it?${prompt};
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};
Is that so? This must be hard on you too, huh? Sorry...${prompt};
Is that so? Then don't forget it!${prompt};
...;
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you stick with it through to the end!${prompt};
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should stick with it to the end!${prompt};
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse!${prompt};
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Well, all right... Then ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt};
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!${prompt};
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};
Here, let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I'll be needing from you this time.${prompt};
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!${prompt};
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}!;
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};
Hi, ${name-player}!;
What's all this about?${prompt};
I see...;
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};
If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.${prompt};
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt};
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / / /G/ /K/P].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].${prompt};
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].${prompt};
I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};
I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!${prompt};
That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!${prompt};
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};
Oh dear...;
You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions.;
You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.${prompt};
First, we must test the level of trust between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.${prompt};
I'm sure even ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hides things while you are not around...${prompt};
Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.${prompt};
If you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is completely absorbed in its current activities.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Search for the chocobo's item.;
Watch over the chocobo.${prompt};
You find something in the ground.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} appears to be very happy.${prompt};
Kweh!!!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} noticed what you were doing...${prompt};
You gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, didn't you?${prompt};
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.${prompt};
I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.${prompt};
One of the workers at our stable gave this to ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} when it was still a chick, right?${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...${prompt};
At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.${prompt};
Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to want out...${prompt};
The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks happy to see you.${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks irritated.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is sleeping peacefully.${prompt};

Which would you like to talk about?;

Random chitchat.;
An impatient chocobo.;
A curious chocobo.;
A worrisome chocobo.;
A youthful chocobo.;
A happy chocobo.;
A diligent chocobo.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} learns the ability “Gallop”!${prompt};

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} awakens from its sleep.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is still fast asleep...${prompt};
Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!${prompt};
W-wow... You're pretty fast!${prompt};
Th-this is absurd...${prompt};
You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!${prompt};
This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...${prompt};
That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!${prompt};
I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!${prompt};
Now have you learned never to underestimate ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}?${prompt};
This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!${prompt};
It's a tie!${prompt};
Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...${prompt};
Hmph. If ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!${prompt};
Luck was simply not with us today...${prompt};
Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?${prompt};
Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} just fine!${prompt};
Cheep!${prompt};
Keh!${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} becomes friends with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with ${chocobo-name: 1[2]} here...${prompt};
You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?${prompt};
Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with ${entity: 1}...${prompt};
Good day to you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.${prompt};
I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ${chocobo-name: 1[2]}...${prompt};
Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?${prompt};
Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?${prompt};
What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!${prompt};
We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!${prompt};
Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.${prompt};
Foudeel is working on its intelligence.${prompt};
And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!${prompt};
Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?${prompt};
Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.${prompt};
Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?${prompt};
But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.${prompt};
Hey, I remember you!${prompt};
I'm glad you're taking the time to take ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!${prompt};
Oh, there you are!${prompt};
Glad to see you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} out on walks! Keep it up!${prompt};
Well, what a coincidence.${prompt};
I'm glad to see that you're taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
Well, well!;
Fine meeting you here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I am pleased to see that you are taking ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.${prompt};
You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!${prompt};
Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!${prompt};

Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.${prompt};
Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.${prompt};
But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!${prompt};
It looked like he wanted me to take him out...${prompt};
Kweh!${prompt};
Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.${prompt};

Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch.;
This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.${prompt};
I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.${prompt};
Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.${prompt};
How about you, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]?${prompt};
If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in ${choice: 0}[Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Tell me more.;
Sign me up!;
Not today.${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}!;
You are now an official member of the CRA's ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
I see.;
Please come back if you ever change your mind!${prompt};
What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Why race chocobos, anyway?;
How do I register for a race?;
How do I prepare for a race?;
What kind of races are there?;
What are “racing teams”?;
Quit.;
Return.${prompt};
Why not!?;
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};
You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt};
Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt};
Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt};
Join this team?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!${prompt};
Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.${prompt};
Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.${prompt};
What do we have here...${prompt};

Here is the information on the next race:${prompt};
----------------------------------------;
★Free Run★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: None${prompt};
While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.${prompt};
Here is the information on the next race:${prompt};
★Novice Race I★;
Chocobos: 4;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
Use this race to learn the ropes. Try not to worry too much about the other chocobos, and concentrate on discovering your bird's strengths and weaknesses.${prompt};
★Novice Race II★;
Chocobos: 6;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.${prompt};
★Novice Race III★;
Chocobos: 8;
Objective: Place 3rd or higher${prompt};
This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you.;
If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.${prompt};
★Challenge Race I★;
Chocobos: 2;
Objective: Place 1st${prompt};

The promenade.;
Chocobet centers.;
The grandstand.;
Portals.;
Guides.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.${prompt};
It can be found just south of here.${prompt};
The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt};
Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt};
There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt};
All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt};
The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt};
To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt};
The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 1[2]} will be provided anytime you purchase ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or sign up for a race.${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.${prompt};
This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt};
As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt};
For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished.;
Your cooperation is appreciated.${prompt};
Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.${prompt};
They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.${prompt};
This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.${prompt};
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Racing teams.;
Race rules.;
Race types.;
Victory points.;
Race Progression.;
That's about it.${prompt};
A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt};
Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt};
In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt};
For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt};
The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt};
What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt};
Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt};
The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt};
The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt};
The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt};
In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt};
Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt};
Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt};
For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt};
We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt};
No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt};
Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt};
As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt};
Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt};
Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt};
The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt};
As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt};
Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt};
We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt};
Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt};
Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt};
Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt};

Signing up for another race.;
I'm fine, thanks.${prompt};
There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt};
First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt};
Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt};
Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt};
All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt};
A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt};
Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt};
There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt};
There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt};
Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt};
In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt};
The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt};
You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt};
To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt};
The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt};
You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt};
After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt};
This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt};
We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt};
What would you like to ask?;
${selection-lines};
What is chocobetting?;
How do I bet?;
What are odds?;
When do I bet?;
How do I collect winnings?;
Nothing.${prompt};
Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt};
To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt};
Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};
And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt};
Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};
The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt};
To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt};
For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt};
We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt};
Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt};
Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt};
It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt};
What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt};
Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt};
The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt};
Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt};
Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt};
Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt};
Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt};
Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt};
Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt};

With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt};
As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt};
“The Monster Races”!${prompt};
Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt};
Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.;
What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt};
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};
Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};
The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.;
It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt};
Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.;
If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;
Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt};
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};
There are two main types of races.${prompt};
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt};
You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.;
Thank you for your understanding.${prompt};
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};
Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt};
We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.;
The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt};
Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.;
And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt};
As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.;
It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.;
Consider yourself warned.${prompt};
In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.;
Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.;
It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt};
Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.;
These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt};

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.${prompt};
Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...${prompt};
...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt};
Good day, fol--${prompt};
ピヨ！${prompt};
Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt};
Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt};
First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt};
ピヨピヨ！${prompt};
She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt};
She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt};
She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt};
She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt};
She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt};
She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt};
She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt};
She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt};
Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt};
Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt};
Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt};
Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt};
Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt};
ピヨ～♪${prompt};
Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt};
The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt};
She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt};
She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt};
She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt};
And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt};
And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt};
The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt};
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.;
And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...;
...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!;
Good day, fol--;
ピヨ！;
Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.;
And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!;
#${number: 4}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]};
#${number: 5}: ${chocobo-name: 1[2]};
#${number: 6}: ${chocobo-name: 2[2]};
#${number: 7}: ${chocobo-name: 3[2]};
And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!;
Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!;
I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt};
Yeah...;
Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt};
And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt};
Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt};
Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt};
They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt};
Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt};
Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt};
As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt};
${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt};
Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt};
Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt};
And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt};
ピヨッ！${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt};
Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt};
a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt};
This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt};
Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt};
It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt};
We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt};
Well, there you have it.${prompt};
Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen!;
President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt};
...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt};
Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt};
Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt};
Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt};
The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt};
Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt};
So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt};
Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt};
Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt};
My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt};
We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt};
Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt};
Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt};
What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt};
Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt};
Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt};
Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt};
Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt};
Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt};
And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt};
Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt};
Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt};
Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt};
The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt};
When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt};
When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Markovich, what did you think of the start?;
Well, I fel--;
ピヨピヨッ！;
Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.;
Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
And as they pass the halfway mark...;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!;
${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!;
While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!;
All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!;
Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!;
And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!;
ピヨピヨ！;
Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
What's this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!;
Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed is approaching dangerous limits!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s speed has begun to drop off!;
It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!;
The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!;
The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!;
The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?;
And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!;
And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
And now they're approaching the final corner!;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!;
The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!;
What's this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
And it's ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!;
Let's take a look at the results...${prompt};
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt};
There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt};
Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt};
Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt};
Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt};
What an amazing race!;
The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt};
What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt};
The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt};
Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt};
Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt};
Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt};
The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt};
And there you have it.;
This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt};
And now, let's see the results from the last race.;
${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1});
And that's all she wrote, folks!;
The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!;
Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?;
She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!;
She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.;
Until next time, race fans...;
Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt};
Taking the crown for today's race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt};
To the winning steed's owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt};
And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt};
Excellent race, ${name-player}!;
You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt};
Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt};
Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt};
But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt};

With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};
Oh...?;
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};
Is that so...?;
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};
But that's not where it ends!;
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;
But...${prompt};
But...?${prompt};
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};
I see...;
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};
But enough talking, I say.;
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};
Oh, yes, right...;
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};
Whoopee!;
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};
Erm...yes...;
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};
My, oh my...!;
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};
A-ahem!;
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;
<Sniffle>${prompt};
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};
Hrmmm...;
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};
And won't you look at the lineup!;
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};
Huh?;
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};
<Gulp>;
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};
Um...Professor Shantotto...;
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};
Ohohohohoho!;
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!;
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};
H-hey!;
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};
And you, Goccilo!;
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;
Until next time...!${prompt};
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};
What's with the baffled expression?;
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};
But something seems to be different...;
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};
And that completes the lineup, folks.;
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};
But no more...;
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};
Well I'll be...;
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;
Congratulations!${prompt};
Great race, ${name-player}.;
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};
Princess...;
Princess Sakura!${prompt};
Princess...?;
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};
Searching for...me?${prompt};
Yes, Your Highness.;
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};
Are you serious!?;
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};
That is correct.;
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};
...!;
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};
Wh...what happened?${prompt};
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};
So that's what happened...${prompt};
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};
Your Highness!;
But...why!?${prompt};
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};
What's more...${prompt};
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};
What...?${prompt};
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;
I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt};
I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt};
Heehee!;
Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt};
${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!;
Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt};
You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt};
What?;
How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt};
Hohoho...;
It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt};
I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt};
Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?;
No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt};
Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt};
<Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.;
But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt};
You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.;
To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt};
And you, our new Chocochampion!;
Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt};
Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.;
These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt};
And they're off!;
Hrmmm!;
${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!;
Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?;
All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.;
But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.;
Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?;
Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.;
The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?;
The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!;
And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!;
It's crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?;
It's crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!;
The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!;
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?;
It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!;
What's this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!;
${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt};
What's this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!;
Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!;
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!;
And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!;
I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step.;
And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!;
And here's some unexpected drama, folks!;
The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?;
Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!;
Uh-oh, what's going on here!?;
The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!;
Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!;
What's this!?;
All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!;
Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!;
That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!;
Never in all my days, race fans!;
In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!;
How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?;
In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!;
Shantotto starts casting Tornado!;
The speed of the chocobos has dropped!;
The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!;
The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!;
Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?;
What in the world do you think you're doing!?;
Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.;
This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.;
What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?;
I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.;
This could get heavy, folks!;
All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.;
Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?;
It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!;
There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!;
More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!;
And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!;
The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.;
This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!;
This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.;
Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!;
And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!;
Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!;
And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!;
But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?;
I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!;
Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?;
It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!;
The time for a final spurt is now or never!;
And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?;
What would you like to do?;
${selection-lines};
Join table (${number: 2} gil).;
Leave.;
Read manual.${prompt};
There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 8} players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.);
You place ${number: 6} gil in the pot.${prompt};
The final participant has arrived.;
${entity: 0}'s primary roll is ${number: 0}!;
${selection-lines};

${name-player} doubles up...;

${entity: 0}'s final total is ${color: 5}${number: 0}${color: 1}!${wait-35: 3}${prompt};
${entity: 0} has gone ${color: 5}BUST${color: 1}!${wait-35: 3}${prompt};
The game has ended in a draw!${prompt};
The winner is ${entity: 0}!${prompt};
Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.${prompt};
The final place at the table has already been taken.${prompt};
You do not have enough gil.${prompt};
Someone has dropped the die!${prompt};
Read which chapter?;
${selection-lines};
1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”;
2. “Rules of the Roll.”;
3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt};
Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt};
Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt};
In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt};
If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt};
Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt};
Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt};
If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt};
Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt};
It's here! It's here!;
The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt};
If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt};
Where would you like to go?;
${selection-lines};
Nowhere.;
San d'Oria.;
Bastok.;
Windurst.${prompt};
See you again, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt};
Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
You there.;
I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?${prompt};
Have you heard?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I've heard.;
Part-time ghosts!?${prompt};
Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt};
We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.${prompt};
All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Then allow me to explain.${prompt};
A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt};
During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.${prompt};
However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.${prompt};
Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt};
Will you help?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt};
Ah... How droll.;
Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt};
Most excellent.;
There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt};
The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.${prompt};
Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.${prompt};
Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt};
You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt};
Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.${prompt};
Please take this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt};
It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.${prompt};
Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt};
What has befallen you?;
Do you wish to give up?${prompt};
Give up?;
${selection-lines};
I'm done.;
Not yet.${prompt};
A pity.;
Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt};
You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt};
Good day!;
I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?${prompt};
Have you heard?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I've heard.;
Play ghosts!?${prompt};
I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt};
I'll get straight to the point, then.;
We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.${prompt};
Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt};
Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.;
Let me give you the short version:${prompt};
We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.${prompt};
We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?${prompt};
That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt};
Will you help?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.;
I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt};
Thank you!;
Now, there is one thing you should know...${prompt};
The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.${prompt};
But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season's parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.${prompt};
You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
Excellent job, ${name-player}! You've done the witches proud.${prompt};
Here's the reward I promised.${prompt};
It's a witch hat.;
The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt};
Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!${prompt};
Giving up the ghost, eh?${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.;
I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt};
You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?${prompt};
Hi, I'm Gertrude.;
I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?${prompt};
Heard about them?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not at all.${prompt};
You have?;
Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt};
So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?${prompt};
No?;
Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.${prompt};
There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.${prompt};
Sign up?;
${selection-lines};
Right away!;
Not today.${prompt};
Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.;
Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt};
Wonderful.;
There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.${prompt};
First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.${prompt};
Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!${prompt};
Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.${prompt};
You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.${prompt};
Good luck!${prompt};
How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?${prompt};
Either way, your help has been invaluable.;
Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt};
It's a witch hat.;
Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt};
Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.${prompt};
What's wrong?;
Have you grown tired of your duties?${prompt};
Oh, I see...;
Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.${prompt};
You are to join with Maryse's congregation.${prompt};
I shall let you know when there is another opening.${prompt};
I'll let you know when a spot opens up.${prompt};
You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.${prompt};
Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!${prompt};
You can't stop now. You've just started!${prompt};
You've only just begun.${prompt};
There's still a long way to go.${prompt};
Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.${prompt};
Almost halfway...${prompt};
It's still a little too early to go back.${prompt};
Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.${prompt};
Just a little longer...${prompt};
You're almost done!${prompt};
Alright! It's time to collect your reward!${prompt};
You've joined the procession.${prompt};
Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt};
Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?;
${selection-lines};
Sure!;
Doing what?;
Not today.${prompt};
A thousand thanks, kupo!;
Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt};
Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!;
Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt};
You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt};
Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt};
It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt};
And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt};
However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt};
And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt};
By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt};
One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt};
We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt};
Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt};
...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt};
The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt};
So, what do you say, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
I'm in.;
Maybe later.${prompt};
Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt};
Kupopo...${prompt};
Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt};
My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?${prompt};
Amazing! You've already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt};
Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt};
Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those ${choice: 0}[San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!${prompt};
Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt};
Where would like to go, kupo?;
${selection-lines};

The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!${prompt};
And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!${prompt};
But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo...;
There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...${prompt};
Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!${prompt};
I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom.;
All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt};
The recipient for this present was supposed to be ${choice: 8}[level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].${prompt};
And I'm pretty sure we were looking for ${choice: 9}[a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].${prompt};
Someone who was trained as ${choice: 10}[a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...${prompt};
If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.${prompt};
Give up for now?;
${selection-lines};
That would be best.;
Not just yet!${prompt};
Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo.;
But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!${prompt};
Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.${prompt};
Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo.;
But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...${prompt};
Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!${prompt};
Presents can be claimed using a card just like this!;
Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!${prompt};
Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!${prompt};
Hand this card to your friend.;
It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!${prompt};
Your help was invaluable!;
Here, this is for you, kupo!${prompt};
There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo!;
Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!${prompt};
I'm so glad we found you!;
Here's your present, kupo!${prompt};
What are you trying to pull, kupo!?;
Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!${prompt};
One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!${prompt};
The San d'Oria residential area is ahead. You'll find your Mog House within.${prompt};

Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!${prompt};
An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!${prompt};
In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!${prompt};
But all is not well...${prompt};
You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.${prompt};
Why is that such a bad thing, you ask?;
By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.${prompt};
That must not be allowed to happen!;
If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!${prompt};
And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either.;
She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.${prompt};
Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!${prompt};
And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!${prompt};
Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!${prompt};
Princess Amdina, mine one and only!;
I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!;
Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince.;
I, too, have ached to be by thy side again.;
Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?;
Yes, my prince!;
Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.;
Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.;
<Blush>...${wait-36: 2};
Even if thine heart is what I desire, my prince?;
Hahaha!;
My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.;
Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...;
I would know why thou dost love me so.;
To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...;
Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.;
<Blush>...;
My...my prince...I know not what to say...;
Prince Yahiko?;
What is it, my precious?;
<Blush>...;
It...it is nothing...;
Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.;
Aaah... The Goddess is good indeed to deliver me a man of such regal persuasion. Praise be!;
I beg your pardon, Your Highness. Hehehe...;
Far be it from one of my lowly post to make such a brazen request, might I trouble you for the pleasure of your company?;
A-and who dost thou assume to be?;
(Hmph, another shameless festival-goer who knows not where the line is drawn...);
Ahem! Citizen. That thy kind offer is extended with good intent is plain to see, but the prince hath prior engagements.;
Hmph! Forgive this uneducated peasant girl her ignorance, O Lady Most High!;
Well, Your Highness? Surely, a man of your royal upbringing knows that it is unseemly to keep a lady waiting.;
Uh...if memory serveth me true, this way leadeth to the next standing position...;
P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!;
Princess Amdina, mine one and only!;
I have so longed to once more behold thee!;
Oh? Your Highness would make me his princess?;
Y-yes! None other but thou art fit to be my bride!;
Good Goddess... This inexplicable bout of amnesia nigh had me wed twice over! Confound my treacherous memory!;
Your Highness toys with my feelings. Yet my heart will always belong to you.;
Princess Amdina! My beloved!;
Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!;
Hmph!${wait-36: 2};
<Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.;
Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!;
Yes? May I help you?;
While I'm flattered by your attention, distance grows between me and my prize while I engage in idle conversation.;
There will come a time when we two can exchange pleasantries over a steaming pot of San d'Orian tea, but it is not today. I take my leave of you.;
(The trickiest part in the routine fast approaches... Will I be able to survive it unscathed?);
(But of course! I've rehearsed often enough to be able to perform the entire routine blindfolded!);
(Oh, of all the times to be suffering from an acting slump...);
(Did Amdina truly love Yahiko? The princess as she is portrayed in the tale is one thing, but reality could well be different...);
(But then again, a love that unites the people of two warring nations couldn't be any less than the truest love of all.);
(This is surely but another tale grossly embellished for commercial purposes. It shames me to be a part of this blatant moneymaking machine...);
(It feels...uncannily natural to be playing this role. Could it be that I was the princess in a past life?);
(All hail Her Royal Highness, Princess Amdina!);
(But then again, I couldn't hold a candle to the gorgeous actress performing the role in Bastok...);
(Never before had I dreamed that acting could be so uplifting an experience. It's as though I was born to entertain!);
(Etch me now into your memory, San d'Oria, for the humble actress whom you behold this day shall tomorrow become an intercontinental star!);
(But then again, what future could there possibly be for an unremarkable actress such as myself in this cutthroat world?);
(Do my eyes deceive me? It-it's that world-famous theatrical director! Could he perchance have come here to observe my performance?);
(He's staring straight at me--there's no mistaking it! What more of a blessing from the Goddess do I need than this? The time has come for me to shine!);
(But then again, why would a person of his standing travel all the way here for me, a nameless actress? It's naught but a coincidence...);
(The crowd's turnout today is depressingly poor...);
(On second thought, it's merely a quiet time of day. I shouldn't read so deeply into it.);
(To think that I poured my heart into preparing for this role only to be met with indifference...);
(Is he truly the experienced actor that he purports to be? Every line he spits out sounds so...forced.);
(All the same, it cannot be denied that he is giving it his all. I suppose it's a trifle early to dismiss him.);
(What twisted series of incidents could have led to his being chosen for the role?);
(Hasn't it occurred to anyone that this whole event makes mock of a historically significant tale?);
(But then again, it can be said that it serves to preserve knowledge and interest in classic literature. In the end, is that not the most important thing of all?);
(With what madness was I taken to have agreed to this role? I feel so tainted to be party to this...);
(My throat grows hoarse from all this repetition...);
(But then again, a clear, resonant voice comes not from the throat, but the stomach. I needn't fret.);
(Uhngh... My voice...won't carry...like this...);
(Rumors of my co-star's insufferable womanizing habits have been battering my ears without cease.);
(But whatever the truth may be, allowing my mind to stray to such irrelevant thoughts in the midst of a performance serves me not in the least.);
(To think that I've been paired with a loathsome man such as he...);
(Ack... Every excruciating second spent beside this walking, talking embodiment of incompetence drives me closer to insanity. Best I leave now and preserve what's still intact of my mind.);
Princess Amdina!;
Whither dost thou go?;
My princess...;
If thou findest my company to thy liking no longer, thou needest but voice thy mind, for thine every wish is my command.;
(Well, fancy that. I hadn't expected anything resembling ad-libbing from this one. This warrants a second chance.);
'Tis but a simple misunderstanding, my sweet prince. I would have thee join me hither, if it pleaseth thee.;
Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?;
There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!;
As long as I live, no harm shall ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!;
I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.;
Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.;
There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!;
Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?;
My perfect prince... <Sigh>;
The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.;
I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...;
Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.;
<Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...;
Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!;
I beseech thee, loyal citizen!;
Deliver the prince back to mine arms!;
You honor us with your esteemed presence, noble adventurer. Do stay a while and enjoy the hospitality of our fair nation.;
My patience has reached its limit. I'll be part of this farce no longer. You're on your own.;
Wh-wh-what!?;
A parting word of advice before I take my leave of you: You would do well to invest your...talents...in an alternate branch of entertainment. Such as mime artistry, for example.;
No! W-wait!;
Oh, darn... Talk about being put on the spot...;
A-ahem! That concludes the show, folks! We look forward to your company again next time! <Sigh>...;
Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.;
Nor I, my dear princess.;
It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.${prompt};
We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.${prompt};

Hello, faithful fans!;
Mighty Maiden Mumor here!;
I want you all to know how special you make me feel by coming out to listen to one of our little ditties!;
Right, Uka?${wait-36: 2};
Uka?${wait-36: 2};
Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?;
Mwahahahaha!;
Who's there!?;
Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?;
Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!;
Oho, but wipe I will!${wait-36: 1};
Uka, come!;
I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.;
N-no!;
Snap this little twig in two.;
By your command.;
Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?;
We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.;
Eeep!;
Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!;
Diva!;
Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!;
And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!;
W-wait...;
Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?;
Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!;
Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!;
C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!;
Grk...;
Keep at it!;
Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!;
Neo Crystal Jig!!!;
Super Crusher Jig!!!;
Shining Summer Samba!!!;
Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!;
Urgh...;
It's my turrrn, now!;
Ouchies!;
Please, I need your help!;
Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?;
Mumor!;
Mwahahaha!;
And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--not with a bang, but a whimper!;
Never shall any in this land know fun again!;
Noooooo...!;
And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.;
The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!;
M-Mumor? What...happened?;
Impossible!;
Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!;
Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!;
But don't rest on your laurels just yet!;
He's...he's a person!?;
Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.;
But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.;
Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!;
No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!;
That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!;
Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.;
Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her “Dancing Force” without the need of any outward shows of support!;
Hmph. You two are pathetic.;
Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!♪;
But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!♪;
The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!♪;
And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!♪;
Wh-what is the meaning of--!;
Now's our chance, Mumor!;
To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...;
We'll dance to the abyss and back!;
Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!;
Eternal Vana Illusion!!!;
Graaaaaaaaah!!!;
We surrre gave him his comeuppance!;
H-how could I...?;
Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!;
You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.;
Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.;
One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?;
C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!;
Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!;
You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.;
Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what “fun” is?;
Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time... I'm finally going to sing!;
M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!;
Tra laaa laaaaaa...※★△✕▽!!!;
Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?;
M-Mumor...I told you...not to...;
This whole time...you were tone-deaf...;
No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?;
Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!;
My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!;
Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!;
Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!;
But for now...enjoy the festival!;

Being an idol isn't only about singing and dancing.${prompt};
It's about winning the hearts of your fans and having them support you through thick and thin.${prompt};
I raised you to be an idol so that one day you might save the world. A father could be no prouder of his daughter.${prompt};
Oh, Daddy...${prompt};
My fine ${choice-player-gender}[lad/young woman], your support of Mumor throughout the years has meant the world to me.${prompt};
This I promise--as dedicated as her fans are to her, she is twice as dedicated to them.${prompt};
And it's thanks to you that I've shaken off the heebie-jeebies and am ready to face a new day!${prompt};
I have a special place in my heart for each and every one of my fans--but especially you!${prompt};
I've been waiting for you, kupo!;
Mumor, the shining starlet herself, has slunk her way onto the streets to see you!${prompt};
I'm so glad you're here! With all my singing and battling, I never seem to find the time to meet my wonderful fans!;
I was positively tickled to see you in the crowd. Can I ask your name?${prompt};
${name-player}, your dancing was positively peachy!♪${prompt};
Remember how Diva called forth another me?${prompt};
You can surely do the same thing, too.${prompt};
I can feel it in the way you lend Uka and me strength.${prompt};
After all, it must mean we have those three special bonds...${prompt};
Could you give it a try? Just for me?${prompt};
To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...${prompt};
Psst! That's your cue!${prompt};
You mean you don't know how to finish off the catchphrase? Well, Uka's not here, so I'll have to think of a separate one for you...${prompt};
...We'll sing and twist until the sun shines through!${prompt};
Yes, that's perfect!♪${prompt};
Wow! It's like I came up with it myself!${prompt};
Now we can be together all year round, not just at the Sunbreeze Festival!${prompt};
/歌はステージでしか;
But as friends, not as performer and fan. I've got to keep my voice pristine for next year!★${prompt};
A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.${prompt};
As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.${prompt};
Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.${prompt};
/clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive effect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.${prompt};
When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!${prompt};
Her dances include the following:${prompt};
Shining Summer Samba:;
/dance1;
Lovely Miracle Waltz:;
/dance2${prompt};
Neo Crystal Jig:;
/dance3;
Super Crusher Jig:;
/dance4${prompt};
That should cover it.${prompt};
Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.${prompt};
So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!${prompt};
We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!${prompt};
That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!${prompt};
A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!${prompt};
What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt};
Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!;
These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt};
And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...;
I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt};
Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!;
Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!;
(By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt};
It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.;
Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt};
Kupopopo!;
Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt};
And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.;
Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt};
And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.;
Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt};
And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.;
Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt};
Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!;
...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt};
It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!;
Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt};
Wonderful work, warden of weal!;
However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt};
The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.;
Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt};
Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!;
Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.;
We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt};
The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt};
I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?;
Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?;
We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt};
What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!;
We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt};
Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?;
The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt};
(Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt};
Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪;
Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy!;
Me nose holes smell the joy,;
The joy from happy toy!;
Wheeere cooould iiit beee?♪;
This for me? In-doo-bid-ably!;
Could be gooder, but it not bad.;
Waaah! It you!;
You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl]!;
Not for us, not for me?;
I give it back. Now you happy?;
Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪;
No no no no no!;
Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!;
...;
You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.;
Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.;
For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?;
Me so happy head go boom! So boom!;
But first, me need give happy toy to you too.;
Happy toy? For me?;
Why you give so good thing to me?;
But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.;
Blech. What this yucky thing?;
It make me want upgut food. Take it away.;
What? But how...?;
If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!;
If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt};
Oh, I see. My apologies.;
How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt};
Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?;
I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt};
Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?;
I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt};
I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?;
Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.;
I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt};
Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...;
Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt};
What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?;
I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt};
I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.;
Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt};
And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt};
How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?;
Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt};
I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt};
Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?;
At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt};
Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt};
Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.;
I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?;
It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt};
Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?;
Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt};
What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?;
Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt};
A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.;
Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt};
While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.;
Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt};
Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt};
Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!;
To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt};
Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.;
Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt};
...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?;
Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.;
By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt};
As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt};
After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me?;
I truly-wuly want to know how ${entity: 0} reacts.${prompt};
Ah, you're back!;
It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!;
I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt};
So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!;
Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt};
Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt};
You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!;
If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!;
You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt};
And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!;
Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt};
Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?;
Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt};
Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt};
Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?;
Thanks for getting it back.${prompt};
Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt};
Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt};
I see you've returned.;
Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt};
What have we here? A cat burrrglar?;
How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt};
What am I talking about?;
That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt};
Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.;
Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt};
But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you're done?${prompt};
What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.;
Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!;
Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt};
A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!;
This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt};
I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!;
Thank you so much!${prompt};
And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.;
The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt};
Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt};
Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?;
That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt};
I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face.;
If you should see ${entity: 0} again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.${prompt};
What's this? A present addressed to me from ${entity: 0}?${prompt};
How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.${prompt};
Would you be so kind as to tell ${entity: 0} that I truly appreciate the gift?;
I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.${prompt};
Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one ${entity: 0}?${prompt};
What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long.;
I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.${prompt};
The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope ${entity: 0} would appreciate a succinct “Thank you.”${prompt};
A present from...${entity: 0}? This isn't one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?${prompt};
Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy!;
Maybe ${entity: 0} has turned over a new leaf since we last met...${prompt};
Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!${prompt};
Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?;
What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt};
I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake?;
But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back! ${prompt};
No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.;
Anyway, please be sure to thank ${entity: 0} for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation.;
Ugh, I'm just terrible!${prompt};
Why would ${entity: 0} be sending me a gift? It's not like there's anything special going on.${prompt};
The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.;
My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt};
I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.;
And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt};
A present for me?;
I'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt};
What? ${entity: 0} wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...${prompt};
Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything!;
Just run back to ${entity: 0} and drop dead! This conversation never happened!${prompt};
You have received ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been taken!;
You handed over ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Have you had the opportunity to speak with Alaune down by the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria? She is said to be a veritable treasure trove of knowledge useful to adventurers like yourself.${prompt};
You there! Yes, you!;
Come here for a moment.${prompt};
You are a member of the Carpenters' Guild, are you not?${prompt};
The splinters in your hands told me as much.;
And your eyes tell me that you'd be just the one to aid a fellow guildswoman in her time of need...;
Am I right?${prompt};
I trust you've heard of the periodic timber survey conducted by our guild?${prompt};
Travel to all regions with harvestable trees and ensure that there has been no deterioration in the quality of the timber.${prompt};
As guild tradition goes, I and my fellow greenhorns were tapped by the guildmaster for this tedious task.${prompt};
My overachieving guildmates have already submitted their reports, leaving only my assigned area--Jugner Forest--incomplete.;
But look at me! Armoires to assemble, bookshelves to build...;
I can scarcely afford a moment away from my sawhorse!${prompt};
Sadly, Grand Master Ulycille isn't hearing any of my excuses.;
Just look at her eyes! If I don't finish the survey soon, her quill pen dagger is going to coming flying through my skull like a nail through wood! At best, I'll be expelled from the guild.${prompt};
That's where you come in.;
I need you to travel to Jugner Forest and complete this survey for me.${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
My pleasure!;
Not today.${prompt};
Hmph! Fine, then!;
Just don't expect any favors when you become old Ulycille's next target!${prompt};
Splendid! I knew I could count on a fellow carpenter.;
Now then, allow me to explain the details.${prompt};
As I said before, the task is quite simple.${prompt};
First, you must venture forth to Jugner Forest.${prompt};
Once there, you need only seek out the varieties of timber listed here on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, determine whether or not they can be harvested, and make note of the results.${prompt};
Return to me with the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and one log of each type of timber you felled, and your task is complete!${prompt};
Easy as hammering a nail, is it not?;
So are you ready to go forth?${prompt};
Ready?;
${selection-lines};
Sure am!;
Could you explain that again?${prompt};
What's the matter? Sawdust clogging your ears?;
Okay, but listen carefully this time.${prompt};
Wonderful! You're quite literally saving my life.;
Best of luck to you!${prompt};
My future as a carpenter is in your hands.;
I know you won't let me down!${prompt};
Back so soon? Let's take a look at your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Now let's see here...${prompt};
Excellent! You've completed the entire checklist!${prompt};
Needless to say, you remembered to bring back a sample of each type of timber, did you not?${prompt};
Almost there!;
Just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} remaining, and you'll be done.${prompt};
You're still missing ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
No, no...this won't do at all.;
What's this? Not even a single sample?;
I didn't entrust you with this survey so you could go on a pleasant forest stroll.;
You actually have to harvest the timber, you know!${prompt};
You'll have to return to Jugner Forest to complete the survey.${prompt};
...And that makes five. Splendid work!${prompt};
Now, I just need to inspect each of the specimens to ensure that the information on your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is accurate.${prompt};
Let's see here, we have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}... Yes, yes...${prompt};
And last but not least, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}.${prompt};
Why yes, it appears that your timber samples are in order--which means that Jugner Forest is all clear for harvesting!;
Tremendous work, ${name-player}!${prompt};
If it's all the same to you, I'll pass your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} along to the guildmaster.;
Fear not--I'll be sure to give you due credit for your deeds.${prompt};
As for the timber you harvested, you may keep it for your own purposes.;
Methinks you could fashion yourself a fine flower stand or two...${prompt};
In any event, my standing in our guild is safe thanks to your efforts.;
Please accept this ${item-singular: 1[2]} as a token of my appreciation.;
You have my eternal gratitude, friend carpenter!${prompt};
In any event, my standing in our guild is safe thanks to your efforts.;
You have my eternal gratitude, friend carpenter!${prompt};
What's this? The texture of this bark seems curiously...different somehow.;
Are you certain these logs are from Jugner Forest?;
Let me take a closer look...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
No, it couldn't be...all of them?${prompt};
Clearly, these logs are not from Jugner Forest.${prompt};
Unbelievable...${prompt};
As I told you before, all samples must be from Jugner Forest.;
Hey, you're not trying to sabotage our survey, are you!?${prompt};
Which variety of timber did you harvest?;
${selection-lines};
Proceed with the quest.;
Arrowwood log (${choice: 11}[Counterfeit/Jugner]).;
Ash log (${choice: 12}[Counterfeit/Jugner]).;
Yew log (${choice: 13}[Counterfeit/Jugner]).;
Willow log (${choice: 14}[Counterfeit/Jugner]).;
Walnut log (${choice: 15}[Counterfeit/Jugner]).;

Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!${prompt};
We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.${prompt};
Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!${prompt};
Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!${prompt};
Ah, you've brought ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}! Here, this is for you!${prompt};
Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!${prompt};
If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.${prompt};
Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!${prompt};
How many tokens will you exchange?;
${selection-lines};
The whole kaboodle!;
I'm a miser. Just the one, please.${prompt};
That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who dared!${prompt};
Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!;
As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.${prompt};
For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record!;
But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.${prompt};
We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
Sign me up!;
I'm a little busy, sorry.${prompt};
We understand...;
But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!${prompt};
You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo!;
Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.${prompt};
Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.${prompt};
Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.${prompt};
And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?${prompt};
Happy delivering, kupo!${prompt};
Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!${prompt};
Here's a little something for your kindness.${prompt};
You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?${prompt};
Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!;
As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.${prompt};
We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?${prompt};
Help the moogles?;
${selection-lines};
But of course!;
I help no one but myself.${prompt};
You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo!;
Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.${prompt};
If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.${prompt};
Let' see... This addressee of this card is a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.${prompt};
Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.${prompt};
Ah, you've brought us a card!;
Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.${prompt};
We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!${prompt};
Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.${prompt};
Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me.;
I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.${prompt};
I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline.;
To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks.;
He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.${prompt};
May I be of service?;
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
Learn recipes.;
Check fewell.;
Replenish fewell.;
Purchase materials.;
Receive training.;
Trade cinder.;
Get information.${prompt};
Recipes, you say?;
Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...${prompt};
...I'm sorry.;
I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.${prompt};
I've got it! How about ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...${prompt};

That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?${prompt};
But of course!;
If you'll just allow me to inspect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a moment...${prompt};
Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows:;
Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.${prompt};
Replenish fewell?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say?;
Then you've come to the right place!${prompt};
...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting.;
Come back again if you need a refill.${prompt};
Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for ${number: 0} gil.;
How does that sound?${prompt};
Pay ${number: 0} gil?;
${selection-lines};
Deal!;
No thanks.${prompt};
Understood.;
Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.${prompt};
I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend.;
Perhaps another time.${prompt};
Excellent!;
Now we just pop open your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} here, and...${prompt};
There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell!;
Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been filled to capacity!;
You hand the synergy engineer ${number: 0} gil.;
How do you expect me to do that when your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is sitting inside a furnace, friend?;
You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.${prompt};
Materials, you say? But of course!;
Have a look at our selection.${prompt};
Purchase something?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
For ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}, that comes to ${number: 2} gil.${prompt};
Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] technique.;
Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.${prompt};
...But I'm afraid you'll need ${choice: 0}[/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.${prompt};
And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training.;
So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?${prompt};
Train in which technique?;
${selection-lines};
Cancel.;
You wish to improve your ${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique.;
Is this correct?${prompt};
It would seem your ${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.${prompt};
Train in this technique?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Very well!;
Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...${prompt};
...See, you take this part here, and...;
Yes, yes...just like that...${prompt};
...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week!;
Phew, that was a close one...${prompt};
...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...${prompt};
<Clink, clank...clunk>;
...Er, let's try that once more...${prompt};
...Superb! A quick learner, I see.;
If only all my students were as attentive as you!${prompt};
Your ${choice: 0}${choice: 0}[/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level ${number: 1}!;
Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field.;
Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
This is what you want, correct?${prompt};
Make the exchange?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.${prompt};
Excellent! And this is yours.;
May it serve you well!${prompt};
You transferred ${number: 0} Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer.;

${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
Synergy furnaces.;

Synergy techniques.;
Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;
Let's see here...${prompt};
A ${item-singular: 2[2]}-shaped aperture, to be exact...${prompt};
...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity:;
...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities:;
...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities:;
...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities:;
That is all.;
Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt};
...Alas.;
It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt};
Hmm, what's this?;
It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt};
Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!?;

Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!;
What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt};
Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!;
Ain't synergy grand?${prompt};
Wait! No, don't tell me.;
You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt};
Learn about synergy?;
${selection-lines};
Not today.;
Teach me!;
Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.;
Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt};
I thought you'd never ask!;
Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt};
Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt};
What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
Halt! You'd best have a good explanation why you're skulking about Chateau d'Oraguille, rabble.${prompt};

Well met, ${name-player}.;
How fare you these days?${prompt};
A letter? And this seal...${prompt};

That said, they have since made amends, and we have accepted their formal apology.;
To hold past misdeeds against them now would be most...unchivalrous...of us, would it not?${prompt};
...And yet the past cannot be so readily forgotten.${prompt};
Begging your pardon, my prince. I daresay that the mere fact that they seek our consent--rather than engaging in devious and furtive plots--shows that we deal no longer with the Silent Empire of old.${prompt};
Settle yourself, Halver.;
I said nothing of denying their plea.${prompt};
Forgive me, my prince. I spoke in haste.${prompt};
It is precisely because I remember well the past that I believe the Empire's plea to be sincere.${prompt};
It is clear this Empress Nashmeira truly intends to lead her nation to a new age.;
I have no doubt that she will prove a staunch ally worthy of our trust.${prompt};
Oho! Never did I think this day would come, but I must say...my brother has the right of it.${prompt};
Besides, were something to go amiss, the presence of ${name-player} here should suffice to keep matters in hand.${prompt};
I could not agree more, my king${prompt};
${name-player} has served the Kingdom with loyalty and valor time and again.${prompt};
I, too, can vouch for this, Father.${prompt};
I have fought by ${name-player}'s side, and you will find no comrade more honorable.${prompt};
The Kingdom is safe in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] hands, Father.${prompt};
Very well.${prompt};
Halver and my sons present a compelling case.;
Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.;
Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt};

Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt};
Yes? Is there something you need?${prompt};
Do you have a question?;
${selection-lines};
Not really.;
About your father...;
About your grandfather...${prompt};
Father? He said he had business at the weaponseller's in the southern part of town.;
Are you an acquaintance of his?${prompt};
He's so engrossed in his blades that he's not given me a swordfighting lesson in weeks!;
At this rate, I shall never become a knight...${prompt};
I am loath to boast, but his knowledge of armor and weaponry is second to none in the Kingdom.;
Helbort often consults with him about rare orders.${prompt};
You've heard of Grandfather? That does not surprise me.;
He was, after all, an angler of no small repute.${prompt};
Why, in his younger days, he would rise at the crack of dawn, and hike through Jugner Forest to Lake Mechieume.;
There, he would lose himself in fishing until sunset. Remarkable devotion, is it not?${prompt};
Oh, would that I could go on such a fishing trip with my own father!;
Alas, it seems he did not inherit Grandfather's love for the sport...${prompt};
Be this your first visit to the cathedral?;
All of Altana's children are welcome here.${prompt};
Hmm? Pray excuse me, but I could not help but notice your interest in that man.${prompt};
His is a heart-rending tale. He seeks absolution for his callous treatment of a distraught young lady.;
As her name is unknown to him, he refers to her only as “the red-haired maiden.”${prompt};
Young man. Nary a day passes by that you are not here, offering words of prayer.;
Surely, such devotion shall not go unnoticed by the Goddess.${prompt};
<Sigh> I sincerely wish that it were so, friar. Then I might have peace in my heart once more...${prompt};
I shall return to adding my prayers to those of others.${prompt};
May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt};
You seek the young man from a moment ago? I'm made to understand he was headed for Laborman's Way.${prompt};
Hm? Aren't you the adventurer from the cathedral?${prompt};
You...wish to know more of the maiden?;
It appears my sad exploits have attained notoriety far and wide...${prompt};
Very well. I have no reason to conceal this from you.;
On the contrary, I welcome it that more people would know me for the contemptible wretch that I am.${prompt};
What!? That fair maiden...is your friend!?;
Please, you must tell me where I might find her!${prompt};
So not even you know of her whereabouts...;
I suppose there is no help for that.${prompt};
Allow me to recount my tale then, as promised.${prompt};
It all began the day past when I went to attend a sermon at the cathedral.${prompt};
That was when I first caught sight of her, as she stepped through the doors, bathed in the radiant light of morn.${prompt};
Trite though this must sound, never before had I laid eyes upon such fairness.;
I still remember well the ornament that adorned her fiery hair...${prompt};
But above all, I remember the deep sorrow that was graven upon her face.;
To simply imagine the pain that racked her gentle heart sent a dagger sliding through mine own.${prompt};
The intensity of my emotions was such that I could not help but reach out to her.${prompt};
B-beg pardons, my lady! If I might have a m-m-moment...${prompt};
Have we met?${prompt};
Um...uh... (Breathe, damn you! Breathe!);
S-s-something weighs heavily on your mind, that much is p-p-plain to see.;
I should be honored to share that burden, if it p-p-please you.${prompt};
'Tis kind of you to offer, but I would not presume to prevail upon a stranger.${prompt};
No, I insist! If there is aught I might do to ease your p-p-pain, you need but ask!${prompt};
This is...highly unusual for me, but since you insist...${prompt};
For true!? You've no idea how much this m-m-means to me!${prompt};
To think that this vision of beauty would share with me her deepest hurts! I was above the moon with joy!;
That is, until she launched into her story...${prompt};
She claimed to be a “Champion of the Dawn,” possessed of the ability to travel to the past.;
Powerful enemies had come from an alternate reality, and she was battling against them to ensure the survival of our world.${prompt};
In the midst of the struggle, however, someone dear to her fell into enemy hands.;
And to compound matters, those who once cared for her lost all memory of her existence.${prompt};
<Sigh>... I consider myself worldly and well-traveled, but naught could've prepared me for the words that spilled from her lips.${prompt};
At some point in time--I cannot say exactly when--bemusement turned into amusement, and I decided that all of it was a great big fairy tale.${prompt};
I found myself staring at her wide-eyed, nodding dutifully as the events--each more fantastical and ridiculous than the last--were regaled to me in intricate detail.${prompt};
And then the guillotine fell. I did that which cannot be undone.${prompt};
Heaheaheaheahhh!!!${prompt};
H-hey! What's so funny!?${prompt};
M-mercy, my lady, but any more of this and my sides are like to burst!${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
I don't believe this! You beg me to share my burden, and I oblige you for what? To have you rain spittle on me with your laughter!?${prompt};
Hmph! That's right, it was all make-believe!;
That you derived such mirth from my tall tale made it worth the telling! I thank you for your precious time!${prompt};
Farewell...and Atomos take you!${prompt};
I must be either losing my mind or the biggest fool in the world to think it a good idea to pour my heart out to some boorish stranger.${prompt};
Atomo...what?;
M-my lady, where are you going?${prompt};
In hindsight, the graveness with which she told her story ought to have been plain as day, even to this blind dolt.${prompt};
Whether or not there was truth to her words was immaterial. The point is, she believed the genuineness of her tale.;
As such, it was utterly tactless of me--cruel, rather--to make light of her as I did.${prompt};
Ah, what I wouldn't give for a chance to see her again and beg forgiveness...${prompt};
You and I scarce know one another, but might I trouble you to...tell me her name?;
The truth is, I've not been able to sleep at night for want of this knowledge.${prompt};
In light of the grievous wrong I did your friend, I would not be surprised if you were to begrudge me this favor. Yet I must ask that you take pity on me.${prompt};
Tell him Lilisette's name?;
${selection-lines};
Aye, the poor sod seems repentant.;
Nay, leave him to wallow in his misery.${prompt};
Lilisette...;
A beautiful name...${prompt};
P-please! I beg of you!${prompt};
I owe you a debt of gratitude.${prompt};
Having had this opportunity to talk to you, it feels as if the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders.${prompt};
May the Goddess bless you thrice over, kind adventurer.${prompt};
You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
However, it is far too small to house an adequate amount of energy. Alone, it serves no purpose.${prompt};
The tiny fragments of Lilisette's memory meld together to form ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};

Quotha...the light that shines forth from thy soul hath brightened a considerable degree.${prompt};
Natheless, it remaineth but a dull glow akin to twitherym dust whenas compared to the blindingly refulgent souls of more accomplished combatants.${prompt};
To fulfil thy true potential, thou needs assume the role of gladiator and bathe in monipulator blood.${prompt};
As a monipulator, thou hast likely reduced opponents everywhere to bawling babes at the mere mention of thy name.${prompt};
Simultaneously, though, combatants who hath cut swaths through adversaries while inside bestial vessels betimes yearneth for more...to bite the hand that feedeth.${prompt};
A saga sung of those who instill terror and those who release the land from it...;
Bwahaha, a worthy tale of spiritual strife, forsooth.${prompt};
Now that the stage hath been set, I shall impart the extent of my gladiatorial knowledge to thee. Simply ask and thou shalt receive.${prompt};
What shall you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Belligerency.;
Ranks.;
Prestige.;
Spoils.;
Domination.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Those who have the ambition to slay monipulators can do battle against them by speaking with ${choice: 1}[me/my Northern San d'Orian ally] or one of my brethren in either ${choice: 2}[Port Bastok or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Bastok] and receiving ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is thy metaphorical muster as well as official avowal to enter belligerency.${prompt};
While it doth provide myriad boons to thee, it preventeth not those outside thy coterie from interfering with thy duty. Such a benediction will only descend upon the yare souls who hath claimed monipulators as their prey.${prompt};
I must also caution thee to beware that, depending on thy level of expertise, it may not behoove thee to tread upon the soils of certain lands.${prompt};
Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to me and I shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.${prompt};
Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to one of my compatriots and they shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.${prompt};
Three ranks doth serve to classify the world's monipulator executioners. There is the eponymous “gladiator (Gla),” “champion gladiator (CG),” and “high champion gladiator (HCG).”${prompt};
Naught else needs be explained anent this simple concept...save that a gladiator's rank is determined by his prestige.${prompt};
Prestige is the gladiator's equivalent of the common adventurer's fame.${prompt};
Defeating both monsters and monipulators increaseth thy prestige, while falling victim to their claws decreaseth it.${prompt};
Each rank also hath a corresponding maximum amount of prestige, much like the infamy of monipulators.${prompt};
Ascertaining thy current prestige is merely a trifle.;
(Access the “Profile” menu under “Status.”)${prompt};
Of course, prestige is not simply a means by which to boast to thy inferiors. Thou canst cede it to me in exchange for troves of splendid rewards.${prompt};
No victory doth taste as sweet as one where the stakes are high. Flaying treacherous notorious monsters and high notorious monsters occasionally earns thee spoils of war.${prompt};
A little cockatrice told me that monipulators even relinquish equipment betimes, so hold not back from slicing, stabbing, and spellcasting thy savage enemies to smithereens.${prompt};
Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics.${prompt};
Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics by my consorts.${prompt};

Forget not that we must have ${item-plural: 0[2]} in order to engrave arcane glyptics, lest thou wish to incur the wrath of my people.${prompt};

Hmph.;
It seems you ${choice: 1}[are hardly fit to be disemboweled by these fiends, so superior are they to you/can hold your own against these colossi of combat/have transcended even these ferocities and reign over all with an iron fist].${prompt};
${number: 39}${prompt};
I am Excenmille M Aurchiat, overseer of all Conflict-related matters.${prompt};
I see. You wish to try your hand at Trust.${prompt};
In bygone times, I might have said that adventurers were to be kept at an arm's distance like the deranged mother of one's partner.${prompt};
Yet when I chose to revive the ancient traditions of Conflict and Ballista, it was you--the adventurers--who heeded the call to battle.${prompt};
As such, I shall permit you to engage in the Trust ritual with me.${prompt};
You...are not aware of what Trust magic is?${prompt};
Sometimes I wonder if Gondebaud's head is filled with naught but cobwebs.${prompt};
The Trust ritual draws forth energy from ardent bonds of trust and camaraderie as are forged betwixt brothers-in-arms upon the battlefield.${prompt};
To cut to the quick, if a strong bond exists between the two of us, you will be able to summon an “alter ego” of me.${prompt};
Indeed, I could drive your foes into the sea as I did the Orcs of Rhazowa.${prompt};
The problem is, I could hardly pick you out of a lineup with similarly built individuals.${prompt};
Yet if our bonds are not strong enough, then the magic is doomed to certain failure.${prompt};
Let us reflect not just on how the two of us came to know each other, but also on how our mutual experiences have shaped us.${prompt};
I remember the honorable efforts you put forth in Ballista.${prompt};
When the sun grows dim and I retire to my quarters, drips of wax gather on my desk as I pore over the day's results. Never could I forget those whose accomplishments stood out from the rest.${prompt};
${choice: 4}[I/I also] remember your exploits in the arena of chocobo races. Your impressive flexibility turned more than one head.${prompt};
I${choice: 2}[/, too,] remember meeting you when I was younger. Or perhaps it was one just like you.${prompt};
Yes, I recall it clearly now. You remind me of an adventurer I once had a grand time with...hohoho.${prompt};
I am reminded of those I fought with side by side...and of my ${choice: 0}[other/father].${prompt};
House Aurchiat is known to look toward the future, using the past as lessons rather than memories...but I would be remiss if I did not admit that your presence has stirred wonderful feelings within me.${prompt};
Yes...I am ready to commit to the ritual.${prompt};
Come. Take my hand and concentrate on the bonds that the two of us have forged.${prompt};
Disgraceful!${prompt};
Hmmm...? No, I'm not displeased. I'm rather pleasantly surprised at our joint success.${prompt};
What is disgraceful is the very thought that there could be two of me! How can my power be unmatched when there are two Excenmilles?${prompt};
Think of it, ${name-player}! Think of the possibilities this magic could open up if only we harness it properly! A whole army of Excenmilles could even...${prompt};
Yes, the Orc Empire would be like a prostrate babe crying out for its mother's milk.${prompt};
Hahahaha, would you fancy that? Tonight we drink, tomorrow we vanquish!${prompt};
I am warming to the idea of this “Trust” more and more!${prompt};
Though I must admit, I barely expected success to come so easily.${prompt};
I triumphed in the bonding only once before. It was with my old friend Rahal, leader of the Royal Knights, but all those who came after have failed spectacularly.${prompt};
But that man can be so infuriating! “Go here!” “Hold your sword like this!” “Turn ninety degrees and touch your nose!”${prompt};
Make sure you do not fall into the same trap.${prompt};
In commemoration of this monumental event, I hereby present you with a scroll containing all we have achieved. Using this should enable you to summon my alter ego.${prompt};
I advise you to try your hand at your nearest convenience--outside of town, that is.${prompt};
May I suggest East or West Ronfaure? They are both nearby, and provide ideal conditions for you to try out this newfound power. When you are finished, return here and inform me as to how you are progressing.${prompt};
Were you successful? Please, tell me everything.${prompt};
How did things go?;
${selection-lines};
Swimmingly.;
Drowningly.${prompt};
It is wonderful to hear that you are getting along well with my alter ego. Good things come in threes, so one more positive thing must await you yet!${prompt};
I see...;
Well, San d'Oria was not built in a day. Keep at it, and I am certain your efforts will be rewarded once more.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I have bequeathed to you will surely be of interest to Gondebaud. He can tell you more--and please, treat my alter ego well. Don't go barking inane orders like Rahal did.${prompt};
All of us involved in this grand experiment are attempting to figure out the exact methodology behind it. This is bigger than San d'Oria. The nations of Bastok and Windurst are as serious as we are.${prompt};
This ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} is intended not just for your own betterment, but for the betterment of us all. Go forth, and discover all there is to be learned.${prompt};
${choice: 2}[By the way/While I have your attention], Curilla of the Temple Knights is also participating in this initiative.${prompt};
I must warn you, however, that she has little time for those who have done her no favors. I highly doubt she would consent to undergoing the ritual with you.${prompt};
Increase your reputation around Vana'diel and do all you can for ${choice: 4}[San d'Oria/your home nation] first.${prompt};
I cannot say for certain whether she would accept you or not, but it could do no harm to make an official visit and make your intentions clear.${prompt};
Hm?;
You wish to know where Curilla is${choice: 3}[ anyway?/?]${prompt};
Why, she can be found in Chateau d'Oraguille, located to the northeast of here. ${choice: 3}[However, I would not expect the guards there to let you pass./You cannot miss it.]${prompt};
I must bid you adieu.;
May glory shine upon you, and on the grand nation of San d'Oria!${prompt};
I am not the only one participating in the Trust initiative here in San d'Oria. You would do well to speak with Curilla, leader of the Temple Knights.${prompt};
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).;
Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).;

If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.${prompt};
Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...${prompt};
...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.${prompt};

Oh, spark exchange... Of course.;

Let me add one thing.;
Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.${prompt};
I'll make it worth your while...I swear!;
Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.${prompt};

How do I give items to people?;
How do I fight outside town?;
What are quests and missions?;
Tell me more about Southern San d'Oria!;
I have other questions.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
I can mark the locations of important people on your map of the San d'Oria area, should you require it.${prompt};
You can find a map peddler taking refuge in the shade of a tree to the southwest, near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
There is an elderly woman near the fountain due south of here who will be more than happy to sell you maps.${prompt};
There are people willing to sell you maps in both Northern and Southern San d'Oria, but the vendor in Northern San d'Oria is closer...if you are in a hurry.${prompt};
Our kingdom has prepared a special tour of duty for newly enlisted troops such as you. Hopefully you make the best of it.${prompt};
To begin the journey, simply talk to Alaune in Southern San d'Oria. She resides near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, head directly south and pass through the gate leading to Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
To rendezvous with her, ascend the stairs that lead southwest, which should take you to Northern San d'Oria.${prompt};
Once there, proceed southward until you reach Southern San d'Oria.${prompt};
I shall mark her position upon your map so you may locate her more easily once you are in that vicinity.${prompt};
It is possible to check who has been marked on your map by opening the “Map” menu, selecting the “Markers” option, and then scrolling to the right.${prompt};
Performing a “Wide Scan” from the “Map” menu also allows you to locate people in your vicinity, should that method prove more convenient.${prompt};
Whether decorated in battle or recently enlisted, all can benefit from trying their hand at Records of Eminence. It is a simple method for participating in Vana'diel's many adventures, and bestows rewards all its own.${prompt};
Open the main menu, go right to get to the next screen, and select “Objective List” under the “Quests” submenu.${prompt};
Select “Tutorial,” head to “Basics,” and accept the objective “First Step Forward” to get started down this magnificent road.${prompt};
Permit me to provide you with a hint for completing “First Step Forward.”${prompt};
Find the person designated by the objective in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark their location on your map.${prompt};
Records of Eminence contains a plethora of objectives, many of which will surely fit your play style. It would behoove you to take advantage of this opportunity.${prompt};
The Trust initiative is a special magic regimen developed by one of the world's finest academies of magic.${prompt};
Those who successfully undergo training will be bestowed with the ability to call forth powerful allies into battle.${prompt};
Only adventurers who have proven their worth by achieving level five are eligible to participate. I will provide you with further information when you reach that landmark.${prompt};
Gondebaud is their representative, and he is stationed in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark his location on your map should you desire to make further inquiries.${prompt};
If you harbor doubts about something I have not yet touched upon, first open the main menu. From there, scroll right to the second page and select the “Help Desk” option.${prompt};
Once you have done that, select “Help Desk” again from the list of categories that appears in the new window. Finally, enter the section entitled “I need help with the game controls.”${prompt};
The answer to your question likely lies there.${prompt};

It would behoove you to remember the following points when engaging in combat outside the city gates. One: outfit yourself with weapons and armor. Two: magic spells are learned from scrolls.${prompt};
Thirdly--and of the utmost import--is that you “check” your adversaries before challenging them. It would not do for you to go charging into battle against an enemy who thoroughly outclasses you.${prompt};
Finally, never forget to check your spoils of war.${prompt};
Tasks issued by residents of the city for you to complete are called “quests.” Simply fulfill the requirements, such as procuring the desired item, to receive a reward.${prompt};
On the other hand, orders handed down directly from those involved with the nation's administration are called “missions.” Converse with the guard by the gate for a more detailed explanation.${prompt};
Open the “Map” option from the main menu, select “Markers,” and then scroll to the right. That will tell you where you need to go.${prompt};

Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt};
Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt};
Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt};
You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt};
Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt};
The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt};
Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt};
Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt};
“Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt};
These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt};
Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt};
Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt};
A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt};
Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt};
Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt};
When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt};
Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt};
No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt};
You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt};
An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt};
One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt};
A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt};
You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt};
Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt};
Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt};
Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt};
The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt};
It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt};
The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt};
Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt};
These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt};
Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt};
Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt};
You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt};
This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt};
This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt};
However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt};
Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt};
Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt};
Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt};
On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt};
Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.${prompt};
The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt};
Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt};
Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt};
Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt};
A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt};
Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt};
A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt};
It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt};
Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.;
${color-alt: 138}The A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.;

Vana'diel...in the year 898?${prompt};
I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...${prompt};
There's something else?${prompt};
You say my father told you to seek me out?${prompt};
I've been trying to figure out as much as I can about the strange portals that link our Vana'diel to another dimension.${prompt};
But we've got other problems to deal with first. Let's worry about it once we've finished our current mission.${prompt};
I'll meet you at the Crag of Holla in La Theine Plateau once we've got that burden off our shoulders. Or we could catch up at Dem or Mea, if that's preferable to you.${prompt};
Remember to see the missions posed to you by your home nation to completion first, though.${prompt};
Master, look at the orb.${prompt};
You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.${prompt};
This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.${prompt};
Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.${prompt};
Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.${prompt};
In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt};
Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.${prompt};
Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.${prompt};
But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...${prompt};
And I am unable to remain here in 884.${prompt};
My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.${prompt};
Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt};
But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.${prompt};
May your steps remain swift and true.${prompt};
Head for...the palace...${prompt};
Master, behold your orb.${prompt};
Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.${prompt};
But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.${prompt};
I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.${prompt};
If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!${prompt};
Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!${prompt};
Master...forgive me.${prompt};
Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.${prompt};
I'm so hungry...${prompt};
Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?${prompt};
I'm here...${choice: 1}[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...${prompt};
Luzaf...I wish you were here...${prompt};
Please...help me...${prompt};
Razfahd must be stopped...${prompt};
Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...${prompt};
I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.${prompt};
I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.${prompt};
Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.${prompt};
The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt};
Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt};
Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt};
Old gods? New?${prompt};
No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt};
We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.${prompt};
And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.${prompt};
There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.${prompt};
Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt};
And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt};
Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt};
But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt};
For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt};
Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt};
Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt};
It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt};
I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt};
All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt};
An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt};
I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt};
Can you truly say that you ${choice: 2}[did/would have done] any different?${prompt};
I channeled my love for my homeland into power.${prompt};
When I fell before you...${prompt};
...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt};
I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt};
And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.${prompt};
This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.${prompt};
Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.${prompt};
Open your eyes and witness the truth!${prompt};
Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?${prompt};
Is this a dream?;
${selection-lines};
What else could it be?;
No. It's something more...${prompt};
Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt};
A keen eye, as always.${prompt};
The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt};
As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt};
I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt};
And those...${prompt};
...Who you are destined to stop.${prompt};
I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.${prompt};
Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.${prompt};
And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt};
You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt};
At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt};
Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.${prompt};
So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt};
One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt};
Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt};
False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers...;
The truth is the pain I feel inside.${prompt};
Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.${prompt};
Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.${prompt};
Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”;
Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt};
No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...${prompt};
...no matter how much you want to give up...${prompt};
You must not. You cannot.${prompt};
Hope is something seized, not given.${prompt};
Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...${prompt};
There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.${prompt};
You are the culmination of all your experiences.;
Even those who are gone still depend on you.;

Master--the orb.${prompt};
You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.${prompt};
Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.${prompt};
He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.${prompt};
I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?${prompt};
What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.${prompt};
We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.${prompt};
Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.${prompt};
And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...${prompt};
The future should have changed...${prompt};
...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.${prompt};
Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.${prompt};
And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.${prompt};
The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!${prompt};
Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?${prompt};
At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?${prompt};
Participate in the Pink Masquerade?;
${selection-lines};
Sounds like fun!;
I think I'll pass.${prompt};
A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!${prompt};
Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.${prompt};
All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.${prompt};
We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.${prompt};
Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.${prompt};
As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.${prompt};
Those whose outfits receive at least ${number: 0} points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.${prompt};
But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these “mannequins” for all to see!${prompt};
That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.${prompt};
Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!${prompt};
Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!${prompt};
Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.${prompt};
As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!${prompt};
The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.;
Do you have any questions?;
${selection-lines};
Who are the winning entrants?;
Tell me about the costume contest.;
What kind of sweets do you want?;
Tell me how entrants are judged.;
I'd like ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.;
None for now.${prompt};
The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.${prompt};
${choice: 1}[/First/Second/Third] place: ${entity: 0} - ${number: 2} pts.;
No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.;
I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Previous page.;
I'm done.;
Next page.${prompt};
The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.${prompt};
As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.${prompt};
Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.${prompt};
Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.${prompt};
In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.${prompt};
And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral...${wait-36: 3};
Ahem! Forget I said anything!${prompt};
Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.${prompt};
Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!${prompt};
Your score for this outfit is...${wait-36: 1};
${number: 0}!${prompt};
${choice: 1}[Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...];
Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!${prompt};
Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!${prompt};
Here is your splendid gift, as promised!${prompt};
I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?${prompt};
Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you ${choice: 1}[/first/second/third] place!${prompt};
Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.${prompt};
That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!${prompt};
As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.${prompt};
Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!${prompt};
(Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)${prompt};
(The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)${prompt};

Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.${prompt};
To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.${prompt};
I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.${prompt};
Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.${prompt};
Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.${prompt};
Will you stay mum?;
${selection-lines};
Mum's the word.;
I don't think so.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.${prompt};
Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.${prompt};
Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.${prompt};
Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this “crystal storage,” if you will.${prompt};
It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.${prompt};
But I can store more than crystals alone. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and the like are also acceptable.${prompt};
My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.${prompt};
You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!${prompt};
You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.${prompt};
Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The ${name-npc} gives a sly smile.;
This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.${prompt};
If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.${prompt};
Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.${prompt};
It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.${prompt};
I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.${prompt};
You are now able to store crystals!;
Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?${prompt};
What would you like?;
${selection-lines};
Crystals returned to me.;
A bit of an explanation.;
Nothing for now.${prompt};
Which element?;
${selection-lines};
Never mind.;
How many would you like?;
${selection-lines};
None, actually.;
A specific number.;

How many? (${number: 8} stored);
${number: 1} ${choice: 0}[/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal${choice-plurality: 1}[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...${prompt};

${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};

No.${prompt};
“As many as you can fit!?”;
I-if you say so...${prompt};
Okay...;
Moogle Magic, ahoy!${prompt};
There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.${prompt};
Inquire about what?;
${selection-lines};
Your purpose.;
Storing crystals.;
Retrieving crystals.;
Who are you?;
Nothing in particular.${prompt};
I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.${prompt};
Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.${prompt};
You want me to hold onto these, kupo?${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.${prompt};
Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Then let the magic begin!${prompt};
That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.${prompt};
Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!${prompt};
You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} for a total of ${number: 2}.${prompt};
You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} for a total of ${number: 4}.${prompt};

You have stored ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]} for a total of ${number: 4}.;
Oh, hello again. If you don't mind me asking, what is that shield you're carrying?${prompt};
Hmm... I can see that you've spoken with her already.${prompt};
Yes, I heard her tale about the shield that can enhance one's crafting ability. I'm not sure if I believe it or not, though...${prompt};
Although, if it's true, that would definitely make it a shield worth having.${prompt};
I know what you're capable of in our field, and if she picked you for this task, it must mean you've got what it takes to make this shield.${prompt};
First things first. Let's teach you the necessary recipe. I recommend that you commit it to memory.${prompt};
Very well then. The first ingredient you will need is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Its purpose is to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt};
I have actually received some notes on Craftsmanship that you should probably hear.${prompt};
You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt};
Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt};
In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt};
You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt};
That is all that it says.${prompt};
Once you've raised the Craftsmanship, please bring me the shield and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Next, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, which can be obtained from Luren.${prompt};
You have made a delivery or two before, yes? That's essentially what you need to do here to receive these items.${prompt};
Please speak to Luren if you require more information.${prompt};
That does it for the ingredients. Please show me the shield once you've upgraded it. I would like to see it.${prompt};
How is it that you managed to forget the recipe? Very well. Here is the list of ingredients again. Remember, true professionals do not need to hear things twice.${prompt};
You are where you are due to hard work and dedication. I have faith that you can do this.${prompt};
I see... With this, I think I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
The ability to pour my soul into this shield and create a crystal from it... I have no idea how it works, but it is really quite fascinating.${prompt};
This is strange. In creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it somehow lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
In the end, that is not really a problem if you want to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you will need to bring the Craftsmanship back up if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
However, I really doubt that you would ever lose such a valuable item.${prompt};
Impossible. You mean you actually managed to misplace the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Oh well. I will make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt};
You are a professional. As such, you need to make sure you take proper care of your ingredients.${prompt};
It looks like you made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt};
Hmm... The shape is different, and I can feel a faint energy emanating from it... Although, it clearly is not complete just yet.${prompt};
No, you'll need to craft multiple times in order to get the best performance out of it. That's what she told me anyway.${prompt};
That reminds me, I'm supposed to mark the shield when it's finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt};
That should do it.${prompt};
Please take the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno for me.${prompt};
Oh, I also have regular deliveries for Luren. It would be quite helpful for training the newer members of the guild if you could help me with them.${prompt};
Thank you for coming. I already heard about why you are here.${prompt};
Let's get started then, shall we? Here is the recipe you'll need.${prompt};
Do you have any questions?${prompt};
Now, allow me to explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Like with the aspis last time, you will need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};
However, you will need to work even harder to imbue your spirit into the shield this time, so it will probably take a while before you are successful.${prompt};
Once it reaches 100%, bring me the shield and I'll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt};
The next ingredient is the ${item-singular: 2[2]}. I've left it along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} you used last time with Luren.${prompt};
Lastly, the ${item-singular: 4[2]}... I asked the A.M.A.N. to help me prepare some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};
You will receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you complete all of them.${prompt};
That's it for the ingredients. You have a long and hard road ahead of you, but I have faith that you can handle it.${prompt};
I see you have increased the Craftsmanship to the necessary level.${prompt};
Wait a moment while I prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Yes, that turned out rather well, I must say.${prompt};
Hmm... Just like I thought, making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt};
Make sure you take good care of this item so you don't have to go through the whole process again.${prompt};
Look at the brilliant design of this shield. You can tell its quality just by looking at it. Of course, I expected nothing less from you.${prompt};
Furthermore, I can tell this shield's power is well beyond the previous one. Of course, it's still probably not enough for her though.${prompt};
Now, let me mark it for you to complete the process.${prompt};
There you go. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be finished.${prompt};
Don't worry, these things happen. Go and try the last objective one more time.${prompt};
It is nice to see you. Let's not waste any time. I shall teach you the new recipe.${prompt};
Hm? You already know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients?${prompt};
I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. As such...${prompt};
Our guild has received a number of orders for some items, but they need to be crafted in front of the customer.${prompt};
You see, the customer wants to see our finest craftsmen at work up close and personal.${prompt};
There are some exceptions, but otherwise only items crafted near the customer will count.${prompt};
I also need you to gather the materials needed to craft the items. You're free to obtain them however you like.${prompt};
On that note, we have reached an agreement between the guilds that will let you use gil to buy certain items from each one that were not previously available.${prompt};
You can buy them from the crafting set vendor in each guild.${prompt};
However, each guild is free to set its own rules, so know that you might not always find what you are looking for.${prompt};
Once you have completed all of the requests, I will give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};
This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Morunaude at Justi's Furniture in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Diadonour at the watch tower in ${unknown: 0x01053782E48080}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Lala Gohma in ${unknown: 0x01053782EF8180}. She can be found near the Heavens Tower.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Morunaude at Justi's Furniture in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};
Oh, that particular item does not need to be crafted near the customer.${prompt};
Once you have completed the request, do not forget to report back to me.${prompt};
Your current request is...${prompt};
Is everything going okay with the request?${prompt};
Everything okay?;
${selection-lines};
Everything's great!;
It could be better...${prompt};
That is good to hear. Please keep working hard for the guild out there.${prompt};
What's that? You want to give up on this job?${prompt};
Will you see this through?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do my best.;
I've had enough.${prompt};
I guess it cannot be helped. I shall find somebody else to finish this task.${prompt};
There are plenty more requests for you to handle, so please come back after you get some rest.${prompt};
So, are you feeling better now? I have the next request here if you want it.${prompt};
Oh, it seems you completed the delivery. Thank you for the help.${prompt};
Ahh, you have completed all of the deliveries. I really appreciate your help.${prompt};
Here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} as promised.${prompt};
I am sure you will never face such a problem, but if you lose either of these items, you can use guild points to obtain a replacement.${prompt};
I really have gotten quite good at this.${prompt};
So this is how the shield turned out...${prompt};
Yes, it really is quite beautiful! I can see your skill continues to grow without bounds.${prompt};
Our friend thinks that the next upgrade will be the one to unlock the true power of the shield. I cannot wait to see what it becomes.${prompt};
Oh, wait a moment. I have a crafting technique that I think would be just perfect for one of your ability. Give it a try when you have a chance.${prompt};
It's good of you to come. It looks like you're nearly finished upgrading the shield.${prompt};
Now, please allow me to explain what comes next.${prompt};
I have prepared the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]} that you will require.${prompt};
If you have enough crafter points, you can exchange them with Luren right away.${prompt};
As for the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, the procedure is the same as before. Let me see your shield after you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};
That's it for my explanation. Your first goal should be to work on getting that Craftsmanship value up. Good luck to you.${prompt};
With the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, Mewk Chorosap mentioned that she wanted it brought to her. Try to deliver it as soon as possible.${prompt};
Hello. What do you need?${prompt};
Ah! You must be talking about the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin asked me to make.${prompt};
I was asked to send it to Jeuno after it was completed.${prompt};
I imagine it must've been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now.${prompt};
Hello again. I have something to tell you. Do you remember that item you were looking for? I found it in the guild.${prompt};
Hm? You need it for something? Sure, that's fine with me. Consider it yours.${prompt};
Hmm... That emblem...${prompt};
Ahh, I see. You've finished the shield at last. It looks absolutely amazing!${prompt};
When you equip it, everyone will know that you're a top-level member of the Carpenters' Guild.${prompt};
One more thing... I have prepared something for you in honor of your achievement.${prompt};
I look forward to seeing you develop your woodworking skills and create breathtaking new items that have never been seen before.${prompt};
0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt};
Oh, greetings, my friend. Ahh, what's that shield you're holding?${prompt};
Hmm... It looks like you've had an audience with her.${prompt};
I heard the story of course. Supposedly, the shield can enhance a craftsman's abilities. I don't pretend to fathom how it works though.${prompt};
Although, if the stories are accurate, then I suppose I should probably try to learn more about it.${prompt};
I know as well as anybody how skilled you are. So if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you must have what it takes to make this shield.${prompt};
So then, shall we get started? First, I'll need to tell you the recipe. This is important, so try not to forget it.${prompt};
So, in order to complete the process, you'll require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Essentially, this enables you to bring the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt};
I received these writings which cover the topic of Craftsmanship in finer detail. If you will allow me to read them to you...${prompt};
I hope you were able to comprehend that information to a satisfactory nature.${prompt};
Once the Craftsmanship rating is high enough, please come show it to me. I'll create the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt};
Next, you'll require ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You will find that you can obtain them from Ore Guzzler.${prompt};
I believe you have made deliveries for people before, yes? That is essentially what you will need to do here.${prompt};
You may speak to Ore Guzzler for more information on the subject.${prompt};
Those are the ingredients you will require. I ask that you show me the shield when it is finished. I am interested to see it with my own eyes.${prompt};
Are you trying to tell me that you've forgotten the recipe already? Very well. Here is the list again. Please do try to remember it.${prompt};
I was known for being quite talented in my day, yet even I must admit that you have surpassed me. I have faith that you will be able to complete this task.${prompt};
I see... With this, I can create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that you require.${prompt};
So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
The technique used to pour my soul into this shield and form a crystal is quite amazing. It is quite beyond my meager understanding.${prompt};
Hmm... It would appear that in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, we seem to have lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
That is not a problem if you wish to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you wish to create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} again, you will need to raise the Craftsmanship once more.${prompt};
I know that you of all people would never lose something as important as this though.${prompt};
Are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
Very well. I can make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt};
You are supposed to be a professional. You must learn to take better care of your ingredients.${prompt};
It would appear that you have successfully made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt};
Hmm... I can tell that it looks different, and can even feel its power. However, it does not seem to be finished yet.${prompt};
I'm sure you've probably heard, but you'll need to craft it multiple times in order to bring out its true potential.${prompt};
Oh, I almost forgot. You require some kind of proof that the work on the shield was finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt};
That should do it.${prompt};
Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt};
By the way, I am always scheduling deliveries to Ore Guzzler. Please stop by and help out the guild if you get a chance.${prompt};
I have been waiting for your return. She told me about your task this time.${prompt};
First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so I do hope you can remember it.${prompt};
That's the recipe.${prompt};
The first ingredient you need to obtain is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Does that name sound familiar? It should, you have used it before. This time, you'll need to craft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
By doing so, the shield's Craftsmanship will gradually increase, just like last time.${prompt};
Once it reaches 100%, come bring it to me. We will be able to use the shield to obtain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
The next ingredient on the list is the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. I hope you haven't forgotten this one either. I have given it along with the ${item-singular: 2[2]} to Ore Guzzler.${prompt};
The final ingredient you'll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}, but for it, I needed to enlist the help of the A.M.A.N. They've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.${prompt};
You may refer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you have completed all of the objectives, you can get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};
That completes my explanation. Your technique is nearly equal to that of my own. As long as you are not overly confident, I have faith that you can complete this task.${prompt};
Very well, let's see what you have there.${prompt};
Yes, quite impressive. Now, I will prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};
Haha. Once again, it seems we have a rather magnificent crystal on our hands.${prompt};
Hmm... It appears that like before, the shield's Craftsmanship drops when producing the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It is no easy task to increase the shield's Craftsmanship. That is why I am certain you would never do anything foolish like lose this thing, right?${prompt};
Yes, this turned out quite impressive. I can see that you approached this task with the utmost seriousness.${prompt};
In fact, you can feel the increased power from this shield compared to the previous one. I am anxious to see how powerful it can become.${prompt};
Now, let me get you that marking you require.${prompt};
There you go. Simply show this marking to Mewk Chorosap and you will be done.${prompt};
I suppose these things happen. Very well. You can attempt the final objective one more time. Once you clear it, I will give you the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, it's you again. I suppose you are here about the shield.${prompt};
I can see that you have already heard about the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt};
You just need to learn about the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}, I suppose. Very well then.${prompt};
The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various items recently, but the items need to be made in the customer's presence.${prompt};
It's the customer's personal request, so I suppose it is in order to keep an eye on the final quality. The customers sure are getting picky lately, but that's the cost of doing business.${prompt};
So they will only accept what they can see you craft. However, an exception is made for items such as those used for repairs. You can simply deliver them directly without any problems.${prompt};
I also need you to gather the materials needed to make the items. I do not care how you obtain them.${prompt};
Oh, one more thing. An agreement was recently formed between the guilds enabling you to purchase some items that were previously unavailable, assuming you can afford them that is.${prompt};
You can speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. It may prove quite useful in your endeavors.${prompt};
However, each guild plays by its own rules. You may or may not find what it is you need. Be sure to keep that in mind.${prompt};
Once you have completed all of the requests, come see me and I will give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};
This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You will find him in front of the Auction House.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You will find him in front of the Auction House.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Naji the Mythril Musketeer in ${unknown: 0x01053782ED8180}.${prompt};
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Raibaht in ${unknown: 0x01053782ED8180}. He can usually be found in Cid's Lab.${prompt};
You can deliver this item directly to the customer.${prompt};
Report back to me once you have finished the request.${prompt};
The current request requiring your assistance is...${prompt};
So, how is the request going?${prompt};
Everything okay?;
${selection-lines};
Everything's great!;
It could be better...${prompt};
I knew I had nothing to worry about. Keep up the good work.${prompt};
What? I always thought you would be the last one to ever give up on something. Are you sure you want to quit?${prompt};
Will you see this through?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do my best.;
I've had enough.${prompt};
Indeed, this type of work can take a toll on the body. I would hate to see you injure yourself. I guess I will have to find somebody else to assist me.${prompt};
I am certain I will have work for you again. For now, please get some rest.${prompt};
Well? Are you rested and ready to get back to work? I can definitely use your help.${prompt};
Ahh, it seems you have completed the delivery. Thank you for the help.${prompt};
Ahh, I see you finished the final delivery. I cannot thank you enough for the assistance.${prompt};
Here you go. This ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} are for you, just as I promised.${prompt};
If you ever need more, you can trade guild points for them at any time.${prompt};
This has gotten to be almost too easy.${prompt};
Hmm... So this is what the shield is like this time around.${prompt};
It never ceases to amaze me. It is surprisingly light despite its sheer size. It is rather unfortunate that it isn't designed for use in battle.${prompt};
She seems to think that the next upgrade will unlock the true power of the shield. I imagine you are looking forward to that just as much as I am.${prompt};
Oh, wait a moment. Would you like to give this crafting technique a try? I have a feeling that one of your skill can use it to make some new equipment.${prompt};
It is good to see you. I imagine you are here to learn about the final upgrade for your shield.${prompt};
First, you will need to learn how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt};
In regards to the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}...${prompt};
I have left them with Ore Guzzler. You are perhaps the last person that I need to explain this to, but they can be exchanged for crafter points.${prompt};
As for the ${item-singular: 1[2]}... It is the same procedure as usual. Please bring me your shield once you have boosted its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};
That covers the explanation for obtaining the materials. Get out there and start boosting that Craftsmanship rating. I will be waiting here for you when you finish.${prompt};
Have you heard? It seems Mewk Chorosap is requesting the ${item-singular: 0[2]} created by this process. You should take it to her.${prompt};
Greetings. Can I help you with something?${prompt};
Hm... That is the item requested by that Tarutaru from Adoulin. It was finished just a little while ago.${prompt};
However, she wanted it sent to Jeuno once it was complete, so I have already sent it off.${prompt};
I imagine it must have been delivered to Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno by now. You should go there and see for yourself.${prompt};
Ah, it is you again. I imagine if you are here, it must be in regards to the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, no? I just noticed it hanging on the wall of the guild recently.${prompt};
This is what you are looking for, yes? Consider it yours for the taking.${prompt};
Oh! So this is what the completed shield looks like!${prompt};
The feeling of quality and weight to it... And you can feel the soul that was poured into creating this emblem... This truly is an immaculate piece.${prompt};
In fact, just looking at it has inspired me to take on all-new challenges with my work. I feel like I am a young man again. Hahaha!${prompt};
Yes, you did a fine job indeed. Now, I would like to teach you a new crafting technique.${prompt};
I want to see you take our craft to all-new levels. I have a feeling that the smithing techniques you develop will be used not just in San d'Oria, but all of Vana'diel as well.${prompt};
Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.${prompt};
Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.${prompt};
What would you like to do?;
${selection-lines};
Purchase a crafting kit.;
Exchange crafter points.;
.;
Special materials.;
Check the deliverable items.;
Ask about the delivery process.;
Never mind.${prompt};
Please select a product.;
${selection-lines};
Maybe some other time.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
1 (${number: 18} gil).;
2 (${number: 19} gil).;
3 (${number: 20} gil).;
4 (${number: 21} gil).;

9 (${number: 26} gil).;
10 (${number: 27} gil).;
11 (${number: 28} gil).;
12 (${number: 29} gil).;
I changed my mind.${prompt};
You want to purchase ${item-plural: 31[2]}? It will cost ${number: 33} gil for ${number: 32} of them.${prompt};
Are you sure about this?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I'm sure.;
On second thought...${prompt};
I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.${prompt};
Which item? (${number: 30} crafter points);
${selection-lines};
I changed my mind.${prompt};
Do you want to purchase the ${item-singular: 20[2]} for ${number: 21} crafter points?${prompt};
Do you want to make the trade?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
You don't have enough crafter points.${prompt};
These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.${prompt};
Deliverable Items;
${selection-lines};
I'm finished here.${prompt};
This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.${prompt};
By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.${prompt};
Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.${prompt};
The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.${prompt};
Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.${prompt};
Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.${prompt};
Please note that you can't use ${item-plural: 1[2]} in place of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.${prompt};
At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of ${number: 2} guild point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s].${prompt};
Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.${prompt};
Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).${prompt};
It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.${prompt};
Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.${prompt};
You receive ${number: 0} crafter point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and now have a total of ${number: 1} crafter point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]!${prompt};
We now have available ${item-plural: 0[2]} for the low cost of ${number: 1} gil per.${prompt};
I am willing to part with up to ${number: 2}.;
My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.${prompt};
What do you want to do?;
${selection-lines};
Obtain a kit.;
Check the scheduled quantity.;
Ship the item.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Which do you want?;
${selection-lines};
Exit.${prompt};
What is the quality? (1-1000);
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}: ${number: 1}${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You have entered the crafting target area.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You have left the crafting target area.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} remaining.${prompt};
I am in need of some ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Can I impose upon you to bring me ${number: 1} more of them?${prompt};
You have my gratitude. Now I just require ${number: 1} more...${prompt};
You have my gratitude. Now I just require ${number: 1} more...${prompt};
Yes, this should do it. They all look simply exquisite. Thank you!${prompt};
Ahh, you are the one helping me out with this task. I require a total of ${number: 1} more ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}. Your assistance is most appreciated.${prompt};
Thank you for this. Now I only need you to bring me ${number: 1} more.${prompt};
Thank you for this. Now I only need you to bring me ${number: 1} more.${prompt};
This is everything I require to bring me one step closer to paradise. I hope that you may join me there some day.${prompt};
This is an explanation of the Assist Channel feature, which allows new and returning players to seek help from veteran adventurers.${prompt};
You must take on the “${unknown: 0x01054082808080}” Records of Eminence objective before receiving the explanation.${prompt};

This marker indicates the mentor's reliability (Mentor Class) and experience as an adventurer (Mastery Rank).${prompt};
As a mentor's Mentor Class increases, the color and shape of the marker will change: ${icon: 0xEFEF}${icon: 0xEF2F} > ${icon: 0xEFEF}${icon: 0xEF39} > ${icon: 0xEFEF}${icon: 0xEF43}${prompt};
A ${icon: 0xEFEF}${icon: 0xEF43} marker is a sign that the mentor has earned the highest levels of trust from other adventurers.${prompt};
The number affixed to the marker is the mentor's Mastery Rank, and indicates how experienced the mentor is as an adventurer.${prompt};
The higher the number, the more experienced the mentor is.${prompt};
You can check your own Mastery Rank even if you do not serve as a mentor, so feel free to take a look every now and then if you are curious.${prompt};
You can check your Mastery Rank by going to Main Menu > Status > Profile.${prompt};
If you wish to speak directly to a mentor, you can search for mentors by going to Main Menu > Help Desk > Mentor Search.${prompt};
The “Thumbs Up” feature enables you to let mentors know when their comments proved to be especially helpful.${prompt};
Mentors who earn lots of “Thumbs Up” replies from other adventurers will see their Mentor Class increase.${prompt};
Remember to give a “Thumbs Up” to any mentor you feel helped you out or taught you something useful.${prompt};
A “Warning” is a feature that can only be used by mentors.${prompt};
Please use this feature when a post's contents are insufficient or otherwise may be construed as harassment.${prompt};
To send a “Thumbs Up” or “Warning” to another player, open the Chat Log Window and move the cursor over the relevant message and press the confirm button (Enter key) to bring up the evaluation menu.${prompt};
Evaluations can be made for 10 minutes following the designated player's latest post to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
You may send up to one “Thumbs Up” and one “Warning” per day (Earth time).${prompt};
The “Mute” feature places restrictions on your ability to post, meaning that other players will be unable to see the messages you post to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
Please refrain from posting unsuitable content so that the veteran adventurers are not forced to mute you.${prompt};
Mute status can be removed by players that have the necessary Mute List access rights, or it will be removed automatically 24 hours (Earth time) after the mute status was enabled.${prompt};
You are free to post messages to the Assist Channel until you decide to stop serving as a mentor.${prompt};
If you log out while you still have time available, your remaining time will be carried over to the next time you log in.${prompt};
You are about to lose the ability to post messages to the Assist Channel.${prompt};
You are unable to post messages to the Assist Channel.${prompt};

Fair greetings to you, wanderer. I am a linkshell concierge, charged with uniting lone explorers of Vana'diel with linkshells of similar goals.${prompt};
How may I help you today?${prompt};
What do you desire?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Show me recruiting linkshells.;
I'd like to hand out ${item-plural: 0[2]}.;
Tell me more.;
Open up the linkshell window.${prompt};
It was my pleasure to meet with you this fine day. May you encounter many friendly faces throughout your travels.${prompt};
Excellent. Please select which linkshell you are interested in contacting.${prompt};
Are you certain?${prompt};
Really receive the linkpearl?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
In the interest of fairness, I am unable to distribute multiple linkpearls to someone on the same day. Please come back tomorrow.${prompt};
It is my sincere pleasure to bestow this upon you.${prompt};
Your new linkshell is beyond doubt filled with many looking for new companions. Be sure to say a few words of greeting.${prompt};
I have prepared a small manual describing the importance of treating others with respect. Please have a quick glance at it when you have a moment.${prompt};
May your new linkshell provide you with fond memories that will last a lifetime.${prompt};
Though it pains me to say this, I have no ${item-plural: 0[2]} that meet your requirements at this time.${prompt};
Should you desire, I can cancel your registration.${prompt};
Cancel registration?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
Not at this time.${prompt};
Should you desire to look for members, I can distribute ${item-plural: 1[2]} in your stead by utilizing the energies continued within your equipped ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
During the process, please equip either ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} as Linkshell 1 and select “I'd like to hand out ${item-plural: 0[2]}.”${prompt};
One that step has been completed, I will ask you a series of questions.${prompt};
To cancel your registration, equip ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} as Linkshell 1, speak to me again, and select the appropriate linkshell from the list.${prompt};
Unfortunately, only those equipped with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} as Linkshell 1 are able to distribute ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Once-in-a-lifetime meetings make for wonderful stories, but no treasure can compare to being part of a group of friends you can call home.${prompt};
Linkshell concierges such as myself bring together adventurers of similar interests.${prompt};
In a word, we match adventurers looking for linkshells with those linkshells interested in taking in new members.${prompt};
I accept ${item-plural: 0[2]} from linkshells the world over and distribute them to appropriate adventurers.${prompt};
This service is provided by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, and as such, anyone working for Vana'diel's greater good is eligible to participate.${prompt};
Additionally, please be aware that I am only able to offer you one ${item-singular: 0[2]} per day.${prompt};
Though we would like to offer this service free of charge, the network has its own expenses that must be paid, so we charge a nominal fee of ${number: 0} gil at the time of registration.${prompt};
It is also worth noting that ${item-plural: 0[2]} can only be registered by adventurers who have been active in Vana'diel for at least ${number: 1} days (Earth time).${prompt};
It is worth noting that each concierge may only register a maximum of ${number: 0} linkshells.${prompt};
Once the number of registrations has hit the limit, existing registrations will be canceled in order of oldest to newest.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}Server maintenances will also immediately cancel all registrations, so be sure to keep your information up-to-date.;
Thank you for taking the time to use our service. Let me confirm the information contained within.${prompt};

I'd rather not.${prompt};
I'm quite sorry to hear you decline. Please let me know if you change your mind.${prompt};

I can start looking for new members immediately. Is this information correct?${prompt};

Start looking for members.;
Stop the process.${prompt};
Your registration is officially complete.${prompt};
May your journeys lead you to many as-yet-unmet friends, and may the bonds you forge last a lifetime.${prompt};
Another member of that linkshell currently has an active registration. Please wait until that registration expires and try again.${prompt};
A manual describing proper chat manners floats in front of you.${prompt};
Read up on which topic?;
${selection-lines};
None for now.;
I don't know what to talk about.;
How can I get people to like me?;
What shouldn't I do?;
What happens if we don't mesh?${prompt};
Perhaps consider starting with a simple greeting. Something like...${prompt};
“Hello, everyone. My name's ${name-player}. Nice to meet you!”${prompt};
Of course, injecting your own personal flavor may act as a conversation starter and help people to remember you.${prompt};
No matter which route you choose, make sure to always remain polite. There is no better way to start a friendship off on the right foot.${prompt};
When speaking with others, it's critical to listen and be mindful of what they say.${prompt};
Always talking and never listening may come across as rude.${prompt};
Another important point is to always be mindful of the listener. How would you feel if someone said that to you? Think carefully before sending someone a message.${prompt};
It also helps to be clear and concise.${prompt};
Being vague might cause others to get the wrong impression.${prompt};
Be extremely careful when giving out personal information such as your address or telephone number.${prompt};
Furthermore, refrain from making disparaging or aggressive remarks.${prompt};
Once you are close to someone, you may be more comfortable letting your hair down, but it is strongly recommended that you refrain from any actions that may be construed as harassment.${prompt};
After joining a linkshell, you may find that you have difficulty participating in conversation or that your personality is too different from the other members.${prompt};
One of your options in such a situation is to inform the linkshell leader and then leave.${prompt};
Finding a linkshell that is the perfect fit might not always be easy, but there is certainly a group out there that will match your feelings and goals.${prompt};
Once you find those kinds of friends, hold them fast and value them as much as they value you. There is no better way to enjoy life in Vana'diel.${prompt};
The linkshell concierge opens up a tiny notebook...;
I refuse to let the Orcs get the better of our kingdom.${prompt};
I am certain that King Destin will heed our advice.${prompt};
Have you investigated the cliffs in the northeastern section of the Beaucedine Glacier?;
It must have been marked on Altennia's map for a reason...${prompt};
That cliff cannot be easily scaled, so I went back to grab something to help us.${prompt};
The Orc mentioned that Altennia's unit was being held in Fei'Yin.${prompt};
Saving the knights is our first priority. We must free them before they freeze to death.;
Meet me at the entrance to Fei'Yin.${prompt};
I will search the west side beneath Fei'Yin, so you take the east.;
We must find the captured knights as soon as possible.${prompt};
${name-player}, I need you to go back to that cliff and keep an eye on the Orcs' movements.${prompt};
I have already conveyed the relevant information to Rahal's unit, so let's return to the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt};
