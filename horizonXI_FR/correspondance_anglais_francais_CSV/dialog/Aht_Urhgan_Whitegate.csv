Ahead of you lies the Al Zahbi residential area.;
You may use the rooms within just as you would a Mog House in your home nation.${prompt};
Ahead of you lies the Al Zahbi residential area.;
All adventurers must lease a Rent-a-Room if they wish to enter.${prompt};
In the event that you decide to lease a Rent-a-Room, your stored items will be moved to Al Zahbi and you will be able to use your new room like the Mog House in your home country.${prompt};
Lease a Rent-a-Room in Al Zahbi?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
No thanks.${prompt};
It seems we are finished here. Congratulations--you now have an Al Zahbi Rent-a-Room at your disposal.${prompt};
(DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!${prompt};
Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

TEST-No.${number: 1}${prompt};
I found ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Kupo...?;
I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};
You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it.;
I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!${prompt};
Your Mog Locker lease is valid until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo.${prompt};

Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until ${ts-year: 0}/${ts-month: 0}/${ts-day: 0} ${ts-hour: 0}:${ts-minute: 0}:${ts-second: 0}, kupo!${prompt};
Master, Master!;
I found this in the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a present from the smilebringers.;
Here, you should have it, kupo!${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.${prompt};
If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.${prompt};
Master! What ${choice: 7}[an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there!;
Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...${prompt};
We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!${prompt};
Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo?;
Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!${prompt};
We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...${prompt};
Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo!;
If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Look at what I found while cleaning out the ${item-singular: 3[2]}: ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;
Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
ボタン押すと次へ進みます${prompt};
It all began with a raindrop,;
or so the legend says...${prompt};
Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;
Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!${prompt};

would prove to be only the beginning;

The hunt registry is a tome through which veteran soldiers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to S.M.A.N. activities.${prompt};
Assignments, or “hunts,” can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.${prompt};
Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference.;
As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.${prompt};
Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training.;
For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.${prompt};
Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.${prompt};
Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry.;
Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as “scylds”--tokens of your valor.${prompt};
More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments.;
Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.${prompt};
Lastly, please note that a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all hunters following the completion of a hunt. Until this time has elapsed, you will not be permitted to undertake another hunt.${prompt};
You record your hunt.;

Your Imperial Standing is currently equal to ${number: 3} points. If you wish, you can purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} with ${number: 5} points.${prompt};
Your rank of captain allows you to purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} free of charge.${prompt};
Purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Here is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
You will lose it upon a single use, but have no worry, as you will have no need for it upon your return.${prompt};
What's this? I am afraid that you already have a ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in your possession.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
What's this? I am afraid your Imperial Standing is not high enough. Come back when you have more experience!${prompt};
What's this? You haven't registered as a mercenary yet? Make your way to Salaheem's Sentinels, now, and you'll discover a whole side of yourself you never knew!${prompt};
Ah, the Astral Candescence is too far for its waves to reach the portals now, so we have to conserve their energy.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but we have orders from the Empire forbidding us from distributing a single ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} until the Astral Candescence is back out of the beastmen's stronghold and safe here in town.${prompt};
Is there anything else you wanted to ask?${prompt};
This Chamber of Passage was built so the Empire could send soldiers to Assault areas at a moment's notice.${prompt};
You can use the runic portals inside to travel to a staging point in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
You've got to open the way first by activating the portal at the staging point, though.${prompt};
Staging points are used to keep surveillance on Assault areas. There are several in the areas of West Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Which staging point will you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Azouph Isle.;
Dvucca Isle.;
Mamool Ja.;
Halvung.;
Ilrusi Atoll.${prompt};
The Azouph Isle staging point keeps watch over Leujaoam Sanctum. It is located to the east of Nashmau, beyond the Deadmist Marsh.${prompt};
The Mamool Ja staging point keeps watch over the Mamool Ja Training Grounds. It is located to the west of Mamook.${prompt};
The Halvung staging point keeps watch over Lebros Caverns. It is located in the northern regions of Mount Zhayolm.${prompt};
The Dvucca Isle staging point keeps watch over Periqia. It is located on an island to the west of Nashmau.${prompt};
The Ilrusi Atoll staging point keeps watch over its namesake--the Ilrusi Atoll. It can be found in a rather dark cave to the north of Arrapago Reef.${prompt};
If you would like information on Assault, please visit the Commissions Agency, right across the way from this building.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};

Good day to you, adventurer.;
The passage over there leads to the Alchemists' Guild.${prompt};
Long have I practiced the art of alchemy, yet I do not find myself becoming bored.;
It truly is fascinating...${prompt};
No! Lemme go!;
Stop that! Behave yourself!;
Again, you come before me...${wait-36: 1};
Nothing has changed since the last time.${prompt};
Please, won't you reconsider?${prompt};
This child has nimble fingers and would soon pick up the trade if he were to live at the guild...${prompt};
Yes, and he uses those nimble fingers to pilfer my goods!${prompt};
What have you done with those herbs and vials?${prompt};
Ah, what are you gripin' about? It was just a bunch of junk anyway.${prompt};
Tinga!;
Mind your manners!${prompt};
Who asked you!?;
I don't need no stinkin' job!;
If you love this place so much, why don't you work here!?${prompt};
I won't always be around to take care of you.;
Try to understand.${prompt};
I don't need no one to take care of me!;
Stay out of my life!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
I'm sorry you had to see that.${prompt};
You're an adventurer, right?;
I've done a fair share of adventuring myself, traveling the world with my sword and my wits.${prompt};
It was not long after I arrived in Al Zahbi when I ran into Tinga.${prompt};
He had lost both his parents...;
An orphan...${prompt};
I tried to find somebody to take him in, but every door was slammed in my face.${prompt};
So I decided to look after him for a time and found myself getting attached to the little scamp...${prompt};
I couldn't just leave him and pick up my adventures again.${prompt};
I was going to continue my mercenary work here and raise Tinga as my own...${prompt};
But then I realized I could no longer swing a sword.;
It seems I've contracted some sort of illness...${prompt};
The doctor says there is not much time left for me.${prompt};
Before I pass from this life, I want to make sure Tinga has some way to support himself.${prompt};
Well, you can see how well that effort is going.;
He has no mind to begin a trade and is only interested in causing mischief.${prompt};
But deep down, I know he's a good kid.${prompt};
What do you say?;
Do you think you can help out a fellow adventurer?${prompt};
I need you to help me turn his life around.${prompt};
Any time I try to have a serious talk with him, he just runs away...${prompt};
To tell the truth, I have no idea where he is most of the time.${prompt};
Quite the dilemma.;
Perhaps I may be of assistance?${prompt};
!!!;
You would help us!?${prompt};
I'm not so cold-hearted as all that.${prompt};
The problem is how to draw Tinga out of hiding...${prompt};
How about we pretend to leave this ${item-singular: 0[2]} behind by mistake?${prompt};
Excellent.;
Please go on ahead. I shall join you once my work here is done for the day.${prompt};
Thank you, Ahaadah.${prompt};
Hail! I trust I did not keep you waiting too long?;
Have you brought the item I requested?${prompt};
(Play the part of a merchant. Just follow my lead.)${prompt};
Yes! This is exactly what I was searching for!;
You've done well to obtain such an extraordinarily rare item!${prompt};
What's this!? You say you have something even more impressive for sale?;
Well then, my good merchant, lead on!${prompt};
Well, well. Look who decided to show up.${prompt};
Hey! Come back here!${prompt};
Aha.;
Nowhere left to run.${prompt};
What's wrong with you!?;
Do you want my autograph that bad!?${prompt};
Spare me your witty comments and return the item you stole.${prompt};
I didn't steal nothin'!;
I just picked it up!${prompt};
Enough is enough!;
You will return everything you've taken from my store!${prompt};
If you do as you're told, I might even reconsider the request to take you as my pupil.${prompt};
That old junk?;
I threw it away already.${prompt};
Threw it away...!;
Why even take it in the first place!?${prompt};
Heh heh.;
You're not alone, if it makes you feel any better.${prompt};
These saucers are from the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt};
These clothes are from Imeeya's store.${prompt};
And this carpet I got from Yazweel's place.${prompt};
I swiped all this stuff in half a day!;
You grownups are so pathetic!${prompt};
Not that I need any of it...${prompt};
You little...${prompt};
You got somethin' to say to me? Don't worry, none of that junk I just dropped was yours.${prompt};
That's the final straw!${prompt};
I've been lenient since you're just a child, but...${prompt};
You go too far!${prompt};
Give me back my carpet!${prompt};
Oh, calm down already.${prompt};
Calm down!?;
I'm going to go out of business if you break any more of my crockery!${prompt};
And you were the one who poked holes in all of my wares, weren't you!?${prompt};
My carpet!${prompt};
What's going on here?${prompt};
You...${prompt};
Tinga has ruined all of our livelihoods.${prompt};
Is this true, Tinga?${prompt};
So what if it is?${prompt};
Then you must apologize to everyone and give back all the things you took.${prompt};
What am I supposed to do with a pile of broken cups!?${prompt};
We don't need your kind around here!${prompt};
You probably put the child up to this in the first place!${prompt};
I never...! How could you...!?${prompt};
You're too sick to work and can't earn a living anymore.;
Isn't that right, adventurer?${prompt};
I knew you foreign adventurers were up to no good!${prompt};
Take your sneaking accomplice and get out of our city!${prompt};
Very well.;
I'll leave if that's what you want.${prompt};
But please, let Tinga stay.;
He's just a child.${prompt};
Tinga...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm glad I had the chance to meet you.${prompt};
Who cares?;
Why don't you leave already?${prompt};
I wish there was more I could've done for you...${prompt};
I said get lost already!${prompt};
Everything has gone downhill since I met you.${prompt};
...${prompt};
If you hadn't interfered, some rich family might have adopted me instead.${prompt};
I really wish you had just left me alone!${prompt};
But now it looks like I'm finally gettin' rid of you.${prompt};
I...${prompt};
I'm sorry...${prompt};
${name-player}. Ahaadah. Thank you for all your help.${prompt};
Alcander...${prompt};
It's fine, really.;
No one is to blame for this.${prompt};
That child certainly is a handful.${prompt};
What are we supposed to do with him?${prompt};
Who would take him in?${prompt};
Especially after that adventurer set him on the wrong path...${prompt};
You don't know what you're talkin' about!;
Alcander didn't do nothin' wrong!;
I'm the bad one!${prompt};
Who was the one who looked after me when I was all alone?;
Not one of you, that's for darn sure!${prompt};
Alcander was the only person who ever looked out for me!${prompt};
What the...!${prompt};
What's going on here, Tinga?;
I thought you hated Alcander!${prompt};
He's my best friend...${prompt};
If that's true, then why do all those terrible things?;
You've forced him away from you.${prompt};
I did it because I want him to stay with me...${prompt};
I know he's really sick and won't be around much longer, so...${prompt};
Ghosts always come out at night, you know.${prompt};
Why's that?${prompt};
Because it's scarier that way.;
Ghosts only show up when they hate someone enough to stay in this world.${prompt};
Is that true?${prompt};
Of course it's true.;
They come back to haunt the people who hurt them in life.;
That's what makes them so scary!${prompt};
I figured if Alcander hated me enough, then he would come back as a ghost...${prompt};
Then I could see him all the time...${prompt};
I see now...;
You poor child...${prompt};
But listen to me, Tinga.;
What you're planning is selfish.${prompt};
It means that Alcander must spend eternity feeling only hate and anger.${prompt};
Is that a fate you would wish for yourself?${prompt};
What's wrong, kid?${prompt};
Don't worry, everything will be okay.;
I was alone, too, but now I've met you.${prompt};
It's good to have friends, don't you think?${prompt};
I can't let this happen...!${prompt};
No, child!;
It's too dangerous out there!${prompt};
You have to bring them back.${prompt};
Who knows what creatures are lurking beyond the city walls?${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Leave it to me.;
Not my problem.${prompt};
Have you no heart?;
You can't stand by and do nothing.${prompt};
Thank you.;
They can't have gone far.;
You can catch them if you hurry.${prompt};
You... You're that adventurer...;
Leave me be. I'm done for...;
Thank you...;
I am in your debt again.${prompt};
Although your effort may have been in vain...;
There is not much...${prompt};
Alcander!${prompt};
Tinga!?;
What are you doing out here? You could get hurt!${prompt};
Thank you for saving him...${prompt};
Tinga...?${prompt};
I knew somethin' was wrong.;
Even when I was causin' all that trouble so you'd come and see me.;
You were tryin' so hard to get me into that guild...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I couldn't take it no more!;
All that worryin' about what's gonna happen to me after you go away!${prompt};
Think about livin' instead!;
I don't want you to go!${prompt};
Tinga...;
I became so afraid when I could no longer wield a sword.${prompt};
I felt so alone.;
Even though I know that's not true...${prompt};
I've been saying this whole time how I want to save you from your fate.${prompt};
But I had it wrong.${prompt};
Tinga...;
You're the one who saved me.${prompt};
You're right.;
There's still time for me.${prompt};
I can't just give up.;
Somewhere in this big, wide world there must be a cure for my illness.${prompt};
And you.;
This is for saving my life. I hope it aids you in your adventures.${prompt};
You really should learn a trade, Tinga.;
You have to learn to stand on your own two feet.${prompt};
Okay.${prompt};
Meet me at Port Al Zahbi towards the south of town. Tinga spends much of his time there, and a little performance may be enough to draw the attention of our little fugitive.${prompt};
My apologies. I was accosted by a customer. Tinga should be running around the port somewhere. I shall join you in the chase momentarily.${prompt};
Tinga must have followed Alcander out into Bhaflau Thickets.;
They probably haven't gone far.${prompt};
You are their only hope.;
Alcander may have once been an adventurer, but his illness...;
He is in no shape to defend himself from the savage creatures out there...${wait-36: 2};
You must hurry!${prompt};
Alcander and Tinga are safe? That is good news.;
And they have begun a journey to search for a cure?;
I do hope they find one...${prompt};
DEBUG: Press a button to continue.${prompt};
We are the Empress...;
The Empress and Aht Urhgan are as one...${prompt};
Our wishes are the wishes of the Empire...${prompt};
ハァ～ッ……;
あんたら、傭兵の分ってモンが;
ちぃ～っとも分かってないようだネェ……${prompt};
There's nothin' like being a mercenary!;
You've gotta get down and dirrrty and show you've got guts! You can't sit arrround expecting the world to come to you if you wanna make waves in this type of work.${prompt};
But what d'you know, anyway?;
You better watch that mouth of yourrrs if you wanna deal with me!${prompt};
いいかい？;
教えたげるから、;
耳かっぽじってよ～く聞きな……${prompt};
ここは、あたいのシマ。;
あんたらは、あたいのステゴマ。;
代わりなんざ、いくらでもいるんだよっ！${prompt};
ん？;
そのカード、ちょっと見せてみな。${prompt};
フフン♪;
あいつらもやるもんだよ。;
傭兵の才はからっきしなかったけど、;
スカウトの才はあったってことかねぇ。${prompt};
We unite...!;
We fight...!;
We fall...!;
For the Empress!;
The Imperial city of Al Zahbi is beset by barbaric hordes, and the heretics on our eastern borders bide their time, waiting for the most opportune moment to strike...${prompt};
But I do not despair.;
This tells us that the prophesied Age of Judgment is at hand.;
Now is the time to prove your loyalty to Her Magnificence, the Empress.${prompt};
Rise, my immortal lions!;
Let us rend the flesh of our enemies!${prompt};
Place your lives in my hands!;
We shall win glory for the Empress and the Empire!${prompt};
Heh heh, you're doing prrretty well.;
Looks like some of that mercenary spirit is starting to sink in!${prompt};
Then again, it's usually times like these when people start slacking off and scrrrewing everything up.${prompt};
I've got a job that's just perrrfect for you.;
So get rrready and get out there!${prompt};

至急、作戦遂行に必要なメンバーをそろえ、;
現地にて突入準備を開始してください。${prompt};
You a mercenary?;
Huh? An adventurer, you say?;
Well, whatever.${prompt};
Got a question for you, “adventurer.”;
You ever hear the name “Olduum”?${prompt};
Heard of it?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
I'm afraid not.${prompt};
Good, then I don't have to waste my breath on explanations.;
The name's Dkhaaya. I've been researching the Olduum civilization for longer than I care to remember.${prompt};
No?;
Don't people remember the old tales anymore?;
"Well, whatever. I won't bore you with any ""When I was young..."" anecdotes and get right down to facts.${prompt}";
The west of the Aradjiah Continent is dotted with ancient ruins. Some say these ruins are the remnants of a civilization mentioned in the folklore surrounding the Ramuh constellation.${prompt};
Can't say as I've found anything to substantiate that claim just yet...;
You never can tell how much truth is in those old stories, so no one knows if such a civilization even existed.;
Course, that's always a good reason to try and find out.${prompt};
You see, Ramuh's symbol is the “Olduum staff,” a weapon said to have power over lightning itself. That's where the name for the civilization comes from.${prompt};
Listen to me prattle away without even introducing myself.;
The name's Dkhaaya. I've been researching the Olduum civilization for longer than I care to remember.${prompt};
As you can see, I'm too old to go traipsing around ruins, looking for clues to the past.${prompt};
That's why I need strong, young mercenaries like you.;
Adventurers. Whatever.${prompt};
Now don't go hurting your brain trying to think too much.;
All I want you to do is bring me back some trinket recovered from the ruins.${prompt};
A reward?;
Well, it may not be uncommon for the people of this land, but I think I have something you might be able to use.${prompt};
What do you say?;
Will you help an old man in his research?${prompt};
Help out?;
${selection-lines};
Okay, why not.;
Not today.${prompt};
Who said you young people were good for nothing? Probably me, but that's neither here nor there.;
Now, I'd appreciate any Olduum artifacts you can dig up--doesn't much matter where you get them from.${prompt};
Have a read through this to find out what you're looking for.;
It has all my notes and illustrations, so you've got no excuse to come back empty-handed. Happy exploring.${prompt};
Are you certain?;
You could be passing up an opportunity to be part of something important...${prompt};
All you have to do is bring me back a trinket uncovered from the ruins.${prompt};
I'd appreciate any Olduum artifacts you can dig up, doesn't much matter where you get them from. Enjoy your exploring.${prompt};
You found something!?${prompt};
Oh, ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}...;
I suppose I shouldn't have expected too much from an amateur...${prompt};
Uh, I mean, good job! My manners are slipping in my old age...;
Even a small discovery may lead to something big, that's what I always say.${prompt};
Here's your reward, like I promised.;
What do you think?;
This ring was excavated from the Aydeewa Subterrane.${prompt};
There've been a lot of rings of this exact same type dug up in that area.;
I've recorded this one in my journal, so you may as well have it.${prompt};
It always struck me as odd that they didn't find any rings of a different design. I mean, it's a fashion item, right?${prompt};
But this is the only design I've ever seen. Maybe the Olduum made them for something other than decoration.;
That's what I'm thinking.${prompt};
Legend has it that the Olduum were able to move wagons using the power of lightning. I wouldn't be surprised if that ring had some secret use that we're not aware of.${prompt};
A curious young monkey like you just might be able to figure it out.${prompt};
Oh, the mercenary.;
Sorry, “adventurer.”;
Hm? You want another one of those rings?${prompt};
I might not need them personally, but I can't just go handing out historical relics willy-nilly.${prompt};
I have a feeling you know what I'm going to ask.;
Yep, it's back to the ruins for you, my friend.${prompt};
I'll take anything you can find.;
It's a fair trade, don't you think?;
Heh heh.${prompt};
Looks like we're still scratching the surface here.${prompt};
Well, good enough, I suppose.;
Here's your new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Try not to lose this one.${prompt};
Hey, think you could help me out?${prompt};
You wanna know what I want?;
I'll tell you on one condition. You have to promise me you'll help!${prompt};
Do you promise?;
${selection-lines};
You have my word.;
To a kid? Ha!${prompt};
I'm not gonna tell you then, you big meanie!${prompt};
Heh heh heh... Actually, I'm no ordinary kid. I'm a thief, first class!${prompt};
(Ack! Don't say anything!)${prompt};
Whew, that was close.;
It's pretty hard keeping my true identity secret.${prompt};
Oh yeah, I was going to ask you to help me. You see, I want to make something that would be really, really important to me!${prompt};
And I need you to find some pieces of paper with letters on them so I can make it!${prompt};
You have to collect 7 letters in all--one each of M, U, and T, and two each of A and D.${prompt};
If you ask around, I'm sure you'll be able to find them all. Good luck!${prompt};
I need 7 letters in all--one each of M, U, and T, and two each of A and D.${prompt};
You say you are collecting strips of paper with letters inscribed upon them?${prompt};
Until just a moment ago, I was pondering a magnificent synthesis project when I saw some bits of paper scattered about. I do not suppose the pieces have moved since...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} discovers a piece of paper with a “u” scrawled on it!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Fernan doesn't seem nearly as drrreamy as he did in his older work...${prompt};
...What?;
You just want a scrap of paper?${prompt};
Well, I guess I'm finished rrreading this anyway.;
I don't think it would hurt to tear one letter out of it, so do your worst.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} rips a letter “A” out of Ekhu Pesshyadha's book!${prompt};
Isn't the air of Al Zahbi simply filthy?;
Whenever I come home, the first thing I notice is all the dust on my clothing.${prompt};
What's this?;
There appears to be some refuse on your garments as well.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} notices a scrap of paper inscribed with a “t” sticking to ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] clothing!${prompt};
Ye be wantin' a scrap of paper with a letter on it?;
Why, I could write such a thing for ye meself!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Balakaf writes the letter “D” on a scrap of paper and hands it to ${name-player}!${prompt};
When I grow up, I'm gonna join the Immortals and become famous! I've gotta practice signing my autograph...${prompt};
Here you go--this one's on the house! You'll be able to get a fortune for it later!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} tears the “M” off of Mhasbaf's autograph.${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Miss/Mister], have you ever seen snow?${prompt};
I'm making a snowstorm using scraps of paper! Do you think it really looks like snow? I want to see the real thing someday, too!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} finds a “d” in the paper snowstorm!${prompt};
No matter how many times I come here, the tea always has such an exquisite flavor. This cup is also adorable. I wonder where it was created...${prompt};
Hm?;
There's something stuck on it...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} finds a scrap of paper inscribed with the letter “A” on the bottom of Qutiba's cup!${prompt};
Wow, you really found them all!${prompt};
Whew, I thought we were done for that time!;
I better hurry and make this...${prompt};
It's done!;
And now it's showtime!${prompt};
!!!${wait-animation: 1};
Where did the dessert go that I just made!?${prompt};
What's this card doing here...?${prompt};
“M A u d A D t”?${prompt};
I'm going to give that greedy little Galka a piece of my mind!${prompt};
...Or so you'd like to hear, right?${wait-36: 1};
Hadahda!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
I know you're there! You better be out here by the time I count to three! One, two...${prompt};
It wasn't me! It was Maudadt! He's one bad apple!${prompt};
Don't you lie to me, young man!;
Have you been pretending to be a thief again? That dish was for the customers!${prompt};
B-but...!${prompt};
I had a snack prepared especially for you, but you're not getting any now!${prompt};
What?;
How could you be so mean!?${prompt};
Sorry for all the trouble.;
Please ignore Hadahda the next time he asks you to do something.${prompt};
I wanted a snack...${prompt};
You're giving it back to me? Yay!;
Thank you so much! Here, you can have this!${prompt};
This is the best ${item-singular: 0[2]} ever! <Munch munch>...;
(Next time I'll make sure I don't get caught...)${prompt};
Hadahda is a real troublemaker.;
Just ignore him if he asks you to do something.${prompt};
Alrrright, guys, I'm counting on you!♪${prompt};
You can relax, 'cause Bashraf's on the job!${prompt};
We're on our way!${prompt};
"We'll have it back here before you can say ""stampeding dhalmel""!${prompt}";
Ah, I forgot!;
I need one more thing...${prompt};
Hey you over therrre, won't you lend a girl a hand?${prompt};
M-me?;
What do you want?${prompt};
I want to make something, but I need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. You wouldn't keep a poor girl waiting, would you?${prompt};
Don't ask me what I'm going to use it for, though. It's a secrrret.${prompt};
Anyway, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is worth a lot to me...${prompt};
I rrrecently found out that Ekhu Pesshyadha has one, but I've begged and I've pleaded and she still won't hand it over.${prompt};
I would be ever so happy if you would go get it from her for me.♪${prompt};
Wh-why me?${prompt};
Because you have such a way with women, of course!${prompt};
She seems to hate me for some reason...${prompt};
I...I think that you should solve that problem yourself!${prompt};
Oh. I see how it is.${prompt};
<Sigh>...${prompt};
You'll help me, won't you?;
Such a nice-looking person wouldn't let me down.♪${prompt};
Just a bit of personal advice, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].;
Everyone is completely enamored of that girl, but she uses everybody for her personal gain. I would stay away if I were you.${prompt};
Ekhu Pesshyadha has the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
I have faith in you!♪ Go get 'em, ${choice-player-gender}[tiger/girl]!${prompt};
You want my ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
Tehf sent you, didn't she? She never gives up, does she?${prompt};
But that's just too bad. I'll never let her get her paws on my stuff.;
That kind of girl makes me feel like scrrratching something.${prompt};
What do guys see in her, anyway?;
The guy who came bugging me last time was my type, too!${prompt};
How could a cutie like that be interrrested in such a brat!?${prompt};
But still, if he came back asking for the vial again, I don't think I could rrresist any longer...${prompt};
His outfit's gleaming embellishments rrreally brought out his dashing Elvaan looks... I wish I could find out more about him...${prompt};
I can't stop thinking about that handsome Elvaan in his brilliantly embroidered clothing... I wish I could find out more about him...${prompt};
Wh-why would I want to go back and speak to Ekhu?${prompt};
Well, if you insist...${prompt};
Oh!;
It's him!${prompt};
Hee hee, nice work.;
You can have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now!${prompt};
What are you waiting arrround for?;
Get out of here so we can be alone!♪${prompt};
To think I'd become more obsessed with Zabahf than Fernan... What's gotten into me?${prompt};
Oh! You got the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for me! How sweet! Why, thank you!♪${prompt};
And since you're sooo sweet, I have one more thing to ask of you, too!${prompt};
I warned you! You shall never escape her now.${prompt};
What are you muttering about over there? You've been awfully rrrude to me lately! Why are you always hanging around here, anyway?${prompt};
What do you mean, why am I always hanging around here? I would like to inquire of you the very same thing!${prompt};
My, my, what an ego.${prompt};
Oh look, if it isn't Ekhu. I'm rrreally enjoying the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you know.${prompt};
That's okay. I don't need it anymore. Thanks to that vial, I found someone much better than Fernan.${prompt};
Oho, this guy? I see you have broad tastes...${prompt};
Thanks to you, we rrreally hit it off!${prompt};
See you later.♪${prompt};
She came here just to show off her stupid boyfriend.;
That kind of girl makes me feel like scrrratching something.${prompt};
And then there's you.;
Just what do you want with me, anyway? I wish you'd leave me alone!${prompt};
What makes you think I would want to be around you, anyway?${prompt};
What a jerk!${prompt};
Our conversation went rather off-topic. Sorry about that.${prompt};
Oh yeah, I wanted you to brrring something to me. It's also for something I want to make...${prompt};
I guess I might as well tell you what it is.♪${prompt};
Are you ready? You can't tell anyone, now.${prompt};
You see, I'm a rrreally materialistic person.${prompt};
But some time ago, I met an old lady in town who said she could make a potion to cure me of my desires.${prompt};
I was sooo surprised!${prompt};
But the potion is rrreally hard to make and uses a lot of ingredients. That's why I have to ask for help to find everything.${prompt};
Do you think you could help me find the rrrest of the ingredients? Pretty please?${prompt};
Help her out?;
${selection-lines};
...;
I have a dental appointment.${prompt};
Oh...and I really thought you'd help me, too...${prompt};
Fine. If that is the case, I will get them for you.${prompt};
You're still here? What an interesting turn of events.${prompt};
We must fix that foul personality of yours quickly before everyone suffers.${prompt};
Okay, that was totally uncalled for! I don't need any of your help!${prompt};
Finally he's gone. What a complete jerk!${prompt};
I wonder how the old lady is coming along with that potion...${prompt};
I wonder if the old lady's having any luck with the potion...${prompt};
Fixing someone's materialism with a potion? What a curious old lady! I smell a rat.${prompt};
Kyahaha!;
Look at how much I have now! And I bet I can squeeze even more out of her!${prompt};
I knew something fishy was going on.${prompt};
What are you doing here!?${prompt};
So this is how you make the potion...;
Hey, get out of that! That's not for you to see!${prompt};
Odd... I could swear I have seen this recipe somewhere before.${prompt};
You must be mistaken! That's an original!${prompt};
I will believe that after I have researched it for myself.${prompt};
Are you calling me a liar?${prompt};
I do not know what you are planning, but you had better stop taking advantage of Tehf. That is all I have to say to you.${prompt};
Ohoho!;
This is rich!${prompt};
Do you realize how many people she's taken advantage of? You're one of them!${prompt};
She uses people to get whatever she wants, and even that doesn't satisfy her!${prompt};
You can't cure a spoiled brat. And she's a fool on top of that.${prompt};
No one can help her.;
But I see nothing wrong with clinging to an unrealistic shred of hope.${prompt};
Ehehe.;
Speak of the devil.${prompt};
Tehf! Come back!;
Huh?${prompt};
Just what was that all about!?${prompt};
It was just as I suspected.;
Tehf must have really wanted that potion to be fooled with a lie like that...${prompt};
That old lady tricked me after all. Are you satisfied now?${prompt};
Maybe.${prompt};
Just...get out of my sight...${prompt};
I am back with the item you requested!${prompt};
Along with brave Foudeel!${prompt};
And your hero, Wahboud!${prompt};
Thank you so much, everyone.${prompt};
But I don't need the items anymore... I'm really sorry...${prompt};
What a pity...${prompt};
Even though we worked so hard to bring them to you?${prompt};
Let's go do something more interesting, shall we?${prompt};
What are you looking at? Get lost.${prompt};
Everything I've done seems so meaningless now. I've been looking entirely in the wrong place for what I really want.${prompt};
But you knew that already, and that makes me feel like scrrratching something.${prompt};
But I'm glad you told off that mean old lady.;
...Thank you.${prompt};
I was not doing it for you.${prompt};
Um...${prompt};
I think I need a potion too, so I can express my feelings more clearly.${prompt};
What?${prompt};
N-nothing. You must be hearing things.${prompt};
...Weirdo.${prompt};
What is up with those two, anyway?;
I knew it all along...${prompt};
Oh well. If I don't help them out, who will?${prompt};
Weird. I can't think of anything I want you to get for me! This is a first!${prompt};
Thanks for helping me out earlier!;
The two of us just got back from Bibiki Bay.${prompt};
Actually, I hearrrd Ekhu talking about how beautiful it is there, so I just had to go see it for myself.${prompt};
I just brought Zabahf along as my bodyguard, but it was pretty fun!${prompt};
Let me give this to you in apprrreciation for all you've done.${prompt};
If you have come to talk about Bibiki Bay, I have nothing to say.${prompt};
...But oh, how I would love to go again.${prompt};
That Zabahf guy is always hanging around herrre, so I might ask him to be my bodyguard again someday.${prompt};
You should watch out for that girl over there. She's bad news.${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
I wish I could meet a guy like Fernan...${prompt};
Yeah, go ahead and laugh. I thought maybe Zabahf and I had something there, but...nah. Fernan is the only guy for me!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Ma'am/Sir], have you ever seen an aurora?${prompt};
I heard they look like pretty curtains covering the sky. I want to see one, too!${prompt};
Next, I just have to mix this in and...${prompt};
Excuse me, but I am busy preparing a recipe for a strange old woman.;
If you need something, please ask someone else.${prompt};
All is well on the southern front!${prompt};
All is well on the northern front!${prompt};
I'm practicing my rounds so I can get into the Immortals. Think they'll let me join?${prompt};
Hey, did you check out the Immortals? They're totally awesome!${prompt};
Be ye an adventurer?;
Ye look like ye've been to many a place.${prompt};
Back in the day, I ventured far and wide meself, but now these old bones won't even allow me t' set foot outside of town.${prompt};
I'd love t' get back to the great outdoors, but the passage of time 'as been rough on me, it 'as.${prompt};
I've still got me keen mind, though. Instead of adventures, I'm putting all me efforts into inventing, now.${prompt};
Me greatest work as of late is the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
I created it using an Ahriman lens...${prompt};
The device burns an image onto the lens with a burst of light.${prompt};
Basically, it captures a picture of whatever it be aimed at.${prompt};
And that brings me to me point.;
I want ye to go t' the places I traveled as a lad and bring their pictures back to me.${prompt};
I'd love t' see those lands again.${prompt};
Let's see... First, I want t' see the volcano that can be glimpsed from the Wajaom Woodlands. I'll never forget the plumes of smoke billowing from its peak, even though it was a cloudy day when I saw it with me own eyes.${prompt};
Why, I forgot to mention to ye a mighty important piece of information.;
Ye be needin' ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} t' take a picture.${prompt};
I don't have any on me at the moment, so if ye could find one yourself, that'd be great. I'll be sure to reimburse ye, though, so don't work up a sweat.${prompt};
Ye've brought me a picture? Let me see what ye've got 'ere...${prompt};
This be just what I wanted! This scenery brings back wonderful memories...${prompt};
Sorry 'bout that. I'm sure ye don't want to listen to the sentimental ramblings of an old man...;
Please accept this as me thanks. I might have more for ye to do later.${prompt};
I'll be taking this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} back for a bit, now, so I can replace the lens...${prompt};
I don't remember seeing this... Ye can do better than that, ${choice-player-gender}[m'lad/m'lass].${prompt};
Oh, pine nuts! I'm all out of ${item-plural: 0[2]}! I'll have t' order more, now.${prompt};
Looking at the picture ye brought me has made me feel like a young man again...${prompt};
I'm all out of ${item-plural: 0[2]}! I'll have t' order more, now.${prompt};
Why, this be a genuine ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
I've had a heck of a time getting my hands on these lately.;
It'll take a mite, but ye should be able t' use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with this.${prompt};
I had t' dismantle the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for the time being. It'll take a mite until it's up and working again, so if ye could just check back with me later.${prompt};
It'd be nice if I didn't have to take the fandangled thing apart every time t' change the lens, but there be no use in complaining.${prompt};
Welcome back. I was starting t' think ye'd forgotten about me. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} be ready for use, now.${prompt};
First, I want t' see the volcano that can be glimpsed from the Wajaom Woodlands. I'll never forget the plumes of smoke billowing from its peak, even though it was a cloudy day when I saw it with me own eyes.${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the “Lovers' Rocks” at Arrapago Reef. Standing in the snow and looking upon those two pillars standing side by side always made me think of me dear wife.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
This be the place, all right, but this picture be so dark I couldn't recognize it at first.${prompt};
Maybe the ${item-singular: 0[2]} isn't strong enough? Could this be as far as my invention'll take us? If only the flash was brighter, or...${prompt};
Sorry, but it looks like the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} be all out of juice for now.${prompt};
But after all yer hard work, I shouldn't be complaining. I apologize.;
Anyway, I might be needin' yer services again in the future.${prompt};
I see ye've succeeded in taking a picture of the “Lovers' Rocks” on Arrapago Reef! Ye screwed up the last time, so how'd ye get a hold of this?${prompt};
What's that?;
Ye used ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
That's it!;
That'll create a brighter flash than ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
I can't believe I didn't see this earlier...${prompt};
The way ye young people think do be impressive. Please accept me thanks.;
I might ask ye again t' help me out sometime.${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the ruins that can be glimpsed from Mount Zhayolm. I still remember the sight of them bathed in the gentle glow of the evening sun.${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the flows of lava seeping from the heights of Halvung. It was quite the spectacle for a young lad traipsing through in the wee hours of the morning.${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the ruins in the Aydeewa Subterrane. The howl of the wind there seemed to speak volumes to me...${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the waterfall in Mamook. I was lost for words in its beauty, an opalescent thread reflecting the light of the sun.${prompt};
Next, I want t' see the graveyard in Caedarva Mire. By nightfall, I began t' imagine the tombstones to be monstrous men... That place be more than a mite terrifying.${prompt};
Would ye look at this! The picture's completely white!;
Maybe it's broken...${prompt};
Ye mean t' say ye used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} instead of ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
So that's why it broke... The flash was too bright. Ye'll just have t' try again then, won't ye?${prompt};
This be just what I wanted! This scenery brings back wonderful memor--what?${prompt};
There's something on the edge of this picture...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You can see your name written in tiny letters on the edge of the picture.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ye'll just have t' try again, won't ye?${prompt};
Thanks to ye, I've been able to revisit the places I traveled as a youth using these pictures.${prompt};
Isn't it funny how just looking at these bits of paper can bring back so many memories?${prompt};
I did be wantin' to see the beautiful scenery once more, but I think all I really wanted was to remember how it felt to be young.${prompt};
Someday ye'll enjoy reminiscing as much as I do, so be sure to visit as many places as ye can while ye've still got life in yer bones.${prompt};
Make sure ye burn each image right onto yer heart, ye hear me?${prompt};
Well, I'm sure ye be sick of listening to me ramble. Take this now as me thanks and be off with ye.${prompt};
I just had me a brilliant idea!;
Let's take a picture together t' commemorate this moment!${prompt};
Don't ye be worrying about changing lenses, either. Why, I've changed 'em so many times now I be a lens-changin' expert! I'll have it ready t' go before ye can count t' three!${prompt};
Finished! How about that?${prompt};
Hey lad, would ye mind takin' a picture of the two of us?${prompt};
M-me? Why me?${prompt};
Anyway, just point this at us and hold it just so...${prompt};
Like this?${prompt};
Ye've got it, son!;
Now keep it that way for a mite...${prompt};
Let me see it.${prompt};
Oho! Not bad. Not bad at all. Thank ye!${prompt};
...What did I just do, anyway?${prompt};
Well, now I can chalk up another good memory.;
Ye go make some memories of your own, now.${prompt};
Looking back on these pictures reminds me of when I was but a lad...${prompt};
That reminds me!${wait-36: 1};
I dropped a fair sum o' gold on me travels...${prompt};
That wasn't a good memory at all...${prompt};
What story would you like to be told?;
${selection-lines};

All pictures shot.${prompt};
Thanks for yer trouble. I may ask more of ye later.${prompt};
Ye found me ${item-plural: 0[2]}!?${prompt};
T' think no one else found it all this time...${prompt};
Well, I don't be needin' it anymore, so ye can have it.${prompt};
Eh? You say you're looking for a rrrisk-taker by the name of Yadhiwa? Hmmm... I saw her around here just a moment ago...${prompt};
Who're you?${prompt};
Awww, Balajaha wants his money back?${prompt};
(Grrr, he noticed more quickly than I expected...)${prompt};
If you ask me, he has no room to talk after his willful display of ignorance.${prompt};
And he thinks he can just send a buddy to fetch it back and I'll just hand it over with a smile on my face? Is his intelligence dropping by the minute?${prompt};
You've gotta deal with me before I'll even give you a glimpse of the gold.${prompt};
I'm sure you're prepared, though, right?${prompt};
Of course, it's going to be no cakewalk.${prompt};
You've gotta show that you're serious about helping out your naive friend.${prompt};
And you can do so by providing me with one million gil!${prompt};
Oh? You can't do that? Hmph. You're no fun.${prompt};
Then it'll have to be the dice, won't it?${prompt};
Challenge her to a game?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a roll.;
No way.${prompt};
What? You came all this way looking for me and you don't even want to try? You don't mind going back empty-handed then, eh?${prompt};
Adventurers aren't all they're cracked up to be, are they? Or do you want to prove me wrong?${prompt};
All right then, let's get down to business.${prompt};
The rules are simple: Odd number, I win. Even number, you win.${prompt};
All right, now to decide the wager. What do you have on ya that's valuable to you?${prompt};
What will you wager?;
${selection-lines};
Love.;
Dreams.;
Hope.${prompt};
Psh, I don't want any of that. Don't you have anything better?${prompt};
Ah well. Let's go!;
${color-alt: 208}Yadhiwa readies Dice Roll.;
${color-alt: 121}Yadhiwa rolls a 999!;
Ha ha ha, your ${choice: 0}[/love is/dreams are/hope is] mine!${prompt};
So long, fool!${prompt};
I saw most of what happened...;
Yadhiwa's always like that.${prompt};
There's always someone after her, but she manages to wrrriggle her way out of it.${prompt};
I wonder why she starrrted cheating people out of their gold.;
If she were a bit nicer, people would probably even consider her beautiful...${prompt};
So, are you still going to go after Yadhiwa?${prompt};
She looked like she was headed for Nashmau. If you'rrre quick, you may be able to catch her there.${prompt};
Hello, I'm ${name-npc}, and I'll appraise any item that you just can't figure out for the low, low price of ${number: 0} gil!${prompt};
Have an item appraised?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
Not now.;
What's this all about?${prompt};
All right then, just trade me the item you want appraised and I'll tell you what it is for the ridiculously low price of ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
I will put the appraised item into your treasure pool, but I might not be able to fit it into your bag if you haven't made space beforehand or if you've already got an item you can only have one of. Always make sure to clean your bag before asking for an appraisal!${prompt};
Please come again.${prompt};
Sometimes you come across an item that you just can't make heads or tails of. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see one. It could be an onion sword or a rune blade for all your eyes tell you! But there's no need for worry--just bring it to me and I'll tell you what it is.${prompt};
Thank you for your patronage.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
This seems to be...${prompt};
I have finished appraising your item. It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
I'll just put it in your treasure pool now...${prompt};
All is well on the northern front!${prompt};
All is well on the southern front!${prompt};
Hm?;
Was your search successful?${prompt};
No, I've looked into every nook and cranny, but still no sign...${prompt};
Nothin' here either!${prompt};
Do you think...;
Do you think we're dealing with a kidnapper?${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...;
What if...what if our benefactor is tied up somewhere!? Or being tortured!?${prompt};
Why do you always gotta come up with the worst-case scenario?${prompt};
But...but...${prompt};
Did you hear that, ${choice: 0}[Miss/Mister] Adventurer?;
This is like a scene from one of those detective stories!${prompt};
You two!;
We got some questions to ask you!${prompt};
Ahem. How may I be of service?;
Need a keen eye? A strong arm?;
I'm your boy! Ah, I mean, man!${prompt};
Oh! Um, have you...have you seen our benefactor anywhere?${prompt};
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here.${prompt};
Allow me to explain.;
As you probably overheard, we're looking for someone.${prompt};
You see, the owner of the mansion in which we work--our employer and dear benefactor--has gone missing.${prompt};
Building on the business of previous generations, our employer has become an incredible success, and quite well known in the Imperial Ward.${prompt};
This eminent personage went for a stroll with one of our fellow retainers yesterday, but never returned to the mansion.;
We've been searching ever since.${prompt};
Our most refined and courteous benefactor should be easy to spot amongst the rag-tag mercenary and adventurer population of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
That piercing gaze, eyes shining like golden jewels...or perhaps lapis lazuli...or maybe more of a ruby sparkle...${prompt};
...In any case, have you seen such a person on your travels?${prompt};
Such a striking person should be very difficult to miss...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
That sounds kind of familiar...${prompt};
Well!? Have you seen our boss or not!?${prompt};
I see so many people come through here, it's really hard to say for sure...${prompt};
Oh dear...;
If no one has seen our wonderful benefactor, then “kidnapped” must be the only answer...${prompt};
Hmm. You have a certain look about you...;
Are you one of those adventurers from the West?;
I knew it!;
Then I must ask your help.${prompt};
Will you aid us in our search?${prompt};
Yeah! Adventurers are always familiar with scummy informers and back-alley shortcuts, right?${prompt};
I can help! I know plenty about Al Zahbi!${prompt};
Our boss is not a sturdy person.;
Walkin' around outside for this long would be too tiring.${prompt};
Something terrible musta happened!${prompt};
It must have been a kidnapper looking for a ransom...${prompt};
We've looked everywhere...${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
Arrrgh!;
I can't take this standin' around!;
I gotta do somethin'!;
Yes, who knows what could be happening while we dally here...${prompt};
We have to keep searching.;
Question everyone! Leave no stone unturned!${prompt};
I'll check the busy areas where all the townspeople gather.${prompt};
I found out we have an information seller in town!;
I'll see if he knows anything about the boss!${prompt};
Then I'll start talking to all the mercenaries and adventurers.;
The smallest scrap of information could be the clue we need!${prompt};
Now just a minute! This person you're looking for is a grownup? Why would an adult not be able to find the way home?;
I have a theory about that...;
Really? What do you think happened?${prompt};
You see, one of our fellow retainers left with our benefactor on that walk last night.${prompt};
And neither of them came back.${prompt};
Just maybe, it was that retainer who...;
Dammit!;Bon sang !
I always had my suspicions about that one!${prompt};
A thief and a beggar from an early age, or so the story goes!${prompt};
I bet the thought of possessing our employer's fortune was just too tempting to pass up!${prompt};
How awful!;
I'll help you look!${prompt};
${choice: 0}[Miss/Mister] Adventurer, you have to help these poor Galka too!${prompt};
We have to find our boss before something terrible happens!;
Any extra eyes and ears would be most welcome!${prompt};
I'll keep a look out around here.;
You go stake out a different area!${prompt};
You found their employer?;
I knew you were something special!;
We have to let those Galka know about this right away!${prompt};
(Wow, those boys really get around...)${prompt};
(It appears the game is over...)${prompt};
(We can't give up now!)${prompt};
(There must be someone who can–)${prompt};
Whoa!${prompt};
Ah...aren't you the adventurer those Galka were talking to?${prompt};
We are caught.;
I suppose we must return to the--${prompt};
We'll never have another chance.;
If we go back now, they'll never take their eyes off us again...;
We can't just surrender!;
...;
That's it!${prompt};
Gramps, why don't we get this person to help us?${prompt};
Wh-what?${prompt};
Introductions are long overdue.;
I am the employer of which those Galka were speaking.${prompt};
I apologize on their behalf.;
They are merely trying to do their job.${prompt};
But this is a big misunderstanding.${prompt};
This man has been my faithful servant for many years--he's like a grandfather to me. I have no reason to doubt his loyalty.${prompt};
However...I do have a reason for my actions.${prompt};
(My...my Lady?)${prompt};
As you can see, this old man is very...frail.;
Yes, frail!${prompt};
Poor, old Gramps...;
That cough is playing up again!${prompt};
<C-cough...cough!>;
He has done more than enough for me--it's time he had his own life to lead.${prompt};
So I've decided to give him his freedo--er, release him from my service.;
He has earned the right to spend his retirement as he pleases in his hometown of San d'Oria.${prompt};
But now that the time has come for Gramps to go, I'm having trouble saying goodbye.;
I want to at least wave farewell as the ferry takes him away.${prompt};
I owe him that much, considering he raised me single-handedly after my parents died.;
Don't you agree?${prompt};
The problem was, my head retainer was firmly against the idea of my leaving the mansion.${prompt};
He said it wasn't...safe.;
An obvious case of overprotectiveness.${prompt};
And so I gave the pretense of wanting to take one last walk with Gramps outside the walls of the compound, ignoring their protests when we left through the front gate.${prompt};
Now you find us in our current fugitive state...;
It's a credit to my employees that they've managed to restrict our movements so effectively.${prompt};
It's only a matter of time until we are discovered.${prompt};
That is where you can help us.${prompt};
I want you to give those Galka some misinformation to lead them in the wrong direction.${prompt};
If you can trick them into going somewhere far from Port Al Zahbi, we will have our chance...${prompt};
But where to lead them to...?${prompt};
There is a port in both the north and the south. If they were to go to the wrong port...${prompt};
Yes! That would be perfect!${prompt};
Would you be willing to lead them to Port Ephramad in the north of the city?;
Then we would be free to make our way to Port Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Please. Will you help us?${prompt};
Help out?;
${selection-lines};
I'll do it for Gramps.;
I'm a terrible liar.${prompt};
Please...;S'il te plaît...
I'm begging you.${prompt};
I promise I'll return to the mansion as soon as I've said my farewells.${prompt};
Thank you!;
Once this is all over, I'll see you're properly rewarded.${prompt};
My thanks, adventurer...;
Oh, and one more thing:;
If you say something funny, or try to rat us out, you'll be in for a world of hurt.;
Got that?${prompt};
...Hehe.;
Good luck!;
Rrright...;
So, can't you give us anything else besides your employer's appearance?${prompt};
But I still have so much to describe.;
I haven't even started on our benefactor's soft, silky hair...${prompt};
Hey! You over there!;
Got a second?;
(You gotta help us. This Galka has been talkin' our damn ears off.)${prompt};
Did I mention how my employer's...;
Oh, the adventurer!${prompt};
You should listen in as well.;
I was just describing our benefactor's distinguishing features--it should help you with the search.${prompt};
(This rrrambling wouldn't help anyone...)${prompt};
Allow me to list the more prominent facts:;
Lost both parents at an early age and inherited a massive estate.${prompt};
Quite contrary to most who come into sudden wealth, never spends more than is necessary.${prompt};
Lives a modest life, and rarely leaves the mansion.${prompt};
Treats the servants with respect and decency--a most excellent employer.${prompt};
And yet there are so many who would take advantage of our benefactor's generosity and kindness in a bid to steal that fortune.;
I never believed that one of us could sink to such lows...${prompt};
Grrr!;
Just wait till I get my hands on that money-grubbing backstabber!;
But, wait!;
Could you be here with information on our employer's whereabouts!?${prompt};
Where is their employer?;
${selection-lines};
Port Al Zahbi.;
Walahra Temple.;
Port Ephramad.${prompt};
Oof!;
I warned you!${prompt};
Urgh...;
Wh-what just happened...?;
Great Walahra! Are you alright!?;
No matter--you must tell me what you have discovered at once! Where is our employer!?${prompt};
(Not there!)${prompt};
Port Ephramad?;
But that's where the ferries for Nashmau come in to dock!;
That land of plague and death...${prompt};
Please inform my two colleagues that they are to travel to Nashmau immediately!${prompt};
Bye-bye...;
Good rrriddance.;
I have no idea what he was going on about, but thanks for getting him out of our fur.;
Oh dear, oh dear...;
I'm terrible at questioning people...;
What if someone gets angry at me for being too pushy...?;
But I have to do it, for our benefactor's sake...;
Look at that Galka, talking to himself like a lunatic.;
It's scaring away my customers.;
You're an adventurer, right?;
Can't you do something about it?${prompt};
Oh! The adventurer!;
Thank Walahra...;
I'm not used to being out here all alone...${prompt};
I have nothing to show for my efforts. Not a shred of information. Not one clue.${prompt};
Of course, that may have something to do with the fact that I'm pitifully bad at talking to people.${prompt};
With all the searching we've done, our employer can't possibly be anywhere in the city...${prompt};
Right? Right?;
I know I'm right...${prompt};
...${prompt};
If only I had gone with them...;
Then our wonderful employer wouldn't be tied up in a cellar somewhere...or chopped up into chocobo feed...or...;
Ah, you must excuse me.;
I always let my imagination get the best of me...${prompt};
Like I said, I'm just not good at talking to people.;
But I have been thinking of other ways to help in the search.${prompt};
Maybe looking for the missing servant instead would be a good idea...${prompt};
That particular person would always get mad at me for being slow...${prompt};
...but then turn around and help me finish my work.${prompt};
And it was nice to have someone who was just as bad at letters as I am...${prompt};
Galiwao and Deminza both think the missing servant is responsible for our employer's disappearance...but I just don't buy it.${prompt};
There has to be some other reason we haven't thought of.${prompt};
I'm sure this could all be explained if we could just talk to them.${prompt};
By the way, have you managed to find any leads?${prompt};
Where is their employer?;
${selection-lines};
Port Al Zahbi.;
The Automaton Workshop.;
Port Ephramad.${prompt};
Oof!;
I warned you...${prompt};
Ouch...;
What just hit me...?${prompt};
Oh!?;
Are...are you alright!?;
What were we talking about again...?${prompt};
(Not there!)${prompt};
No...;
All the way to Nashmau?;
Those violent coastal winds will be the death of our poor, fragile benefactor!${prompt};
I...I've never been to Nashmau...${prompt};
...;
Nashmau it is, then!;
Sea travel might make me sick, but it would make our employer even sicker...${prompt};
Cacaroon got cheeep info, ya?;
Yooo got big moneee? Cacaroon got big info!${prompt};
I'll give you a cartload of gold coins if you can tell me where my boss is right now!${prompt};
Cacaroon not know any “boss.”;
No info for yoooo...;
Galka-man very loud!${prompt};
Wha...why, you...!;
This is going nowhere...;
Oho! Adventurer!;
I found the information seller!${prompt};
But he's a Qiqirn...;
I can't get anythin' useful out of him!${prompt};
Galka-man very roood!;
Galka-man rood to Cacaroon!;
Yooo no get info from Cacaroon!;
The boss had been actin' kinda strange lately...${prompt};
Being careful not to overdo things, and livin' a quiet life for so long...${prompt};
...and then suddenly wantin' to take a walk in the Imperial Ward like it was the most normal thing in the world...${prompt};
I know why things changed.${prompt};
It's that damn retainer!;
That shifty schemer has tricked the boss with some cunning plan.${prompt};
I thought this information seller might have some clues to give me...;
But it looks like we've been outmaneuvered!${prompt};
Grrr!;
I gotta save the boss from that snake's charms!${prompt};
Adventurer!;Aventurier!
Do you have any leads at all?${prompt};
Where is their employer?;
${selection-lines};
Port Al Zahbi.;
The Kokba Hostel.;
Port Ephramad.${prompt};
Uh!?${prompt};
What the...;
I coulda sworn I heard...;
Adventurer!?;
Oof!?;
Next time I won't be so gentle...;
Ugh...;Pouah...
Wh-what hit me!?${prompt};
No time to lose!;
Adventurer! Where did you say the boss was?${prompt};
(Not there!)${prompt};
Na...Nashmau!?${prompt};
Hehehe.;
Nashmau very byoootiful, ya?;
Yooo see many of Cacaroon's friends!${prompt};
...;
Great Walahra...not more Qiqirn...;
I have to get to Nashmau right away!${prompt};
(Now we can slip into Port Al Zahbi...)${prompt};
So here we stand at last.${prompt};
I'll be sure to write you a letter as soon as I arrive in the Middle Lands.${prompt};
I'll tell you all about the Star Tree in Windurst, the mines of Bastok, the chateau in San d'Oria...${prompt};
Yes...${prompt};
Oh!${prompt};
Thank you so much for your help!;
Without you, we never would have made it this far.${prompt};
You have our gratitude, adventurer.${prompt};
Did the Galka have anything to say?${prompt};
Did they insinuate that someone may have been lying to you?${prompt};
G-Gramps!;
What are you saying!?${prompt};
What do you think he means?;
${selection-lines};
Faihal is lying.;
Bernahn is lying.;
Both of them are lying.${prompt};
How dare you!;
I would never...!${prompt};
I'm hurt by your accusations.${prompt};
<Sniffle...sob...>${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
That's enough, Faihal.;
You're making the poor adventurer uncomfortable.${prompt};
I believe ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has figured out our ruse.${prompt};
Not just your deception, but mine as well.${prompt};
...;
Oho, so you accuse me of deception?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ahahaha.;
It appears my acting skills leave much to be desired.${prompt};
Faihal.;
Will you persist with this charade?${prompt};
Ber...!;
I mean, g-Gramps!${prompt};
I don't think our adventurer friend here is fooled by your act anymore.${prompt};
Galiwao and the other are nowhere nearby.;
I think it's safe to talk.${prompt};
...${prompt};
You...you think we are lying to you!?;
We would never lie...that is, never attempt to deceive...${prompt};
Ahahaha!;
That is enough, Faihal.${prompt};
I believe this adventurer has had us figured out from the start.${prompt};
Then...all of this effort has been for nothing...${prompt};
I think it's time we told the truth.${prompt};
Not just to repay this adventurer for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] kindness...${prompt};
...but also so ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] may vouch for your innocence when you return to the mansion.${prompt};
Bernahn...${prompt};
You always were a willful young lady.${prompt};
As I'm sure you've already guessed...;
...I am the true employer of those Galka.${prompt};
I was the one who came up with the lie.;
I just thought it would be easier to convince you to help us...${prompt};
I'm sorry...${prompt};
The original plan was my doing, however.;
You musn't blame Faihal for this situation.${prompt};
I have built on the wealth of my predecessors and amassed quite a fortune.${prompt};
But no matter how much money I accumulate, I cannot halt the march of years.${prompt};
My body has grown frail with age, and I have spent a good deal of my life behind the walls of my estate.${prompt};
However, I have grown dissatisfied with the idea of living out my final days in such isolation.${prompt};
It was a day several years ago...;
I had convinced Galiwao and the others to take me on a walk outside the mansion.${prompt};
We were strolling through the Commoners' Ward when I first encountered Faihal here.${prompt};
Our meeting had rather a large impact on me--quite literally!${prompt};
I was abandoned by my parents when I was still very young...${prompt};
I had no one to turn to...;
No one to care for me...;
I was always alone.${prompt};
I barely survived by filching food from the stalls around town...;
Then one day, I was careless enough to be seen...${prompt};
Faihal was running from a shopkeeper down the very alley where we were walking.${prompt};
It was the first time I had ever bumped into anyone with such force!${prompt};
Thanks to Galiwao's support I remained unhurt.${prompt};
But Faihal stumbled and injured her leg quite badly.${prompt};
I then regretted my decision to venture outside.${prompt};
If I had stayed in the mansion, this child would never have been hurt.${prompt};
However, that single instant was the catalyst for a shift in both of our fates.${prompt};
By the time I had recovered from the shock, the shopkeeper was standing right beside me.${prompt};
But Bernahn managed to convince the man to let me go...${prompt};
I then took her home to have her injury looked at by a doctor.${prompt};
And after engaging her in conversation, I realized how much knowledge she had of the outside world.${prompt};
While her injury healed, I was treated to many a fascinating tale.${prompt};
The conversations of mercenaries...;
The arrival of adventurers...${prompt};
And many stories about her own trials.${prompt};
When I was better, I started working at the mansion.${prompt};
Well, I didn't really give Bernahn a choice.${prompt};
Ever since she entered my employment, I've been able to learn about the city through her everyday experiences.${prompt};
Faihal's tales struck a tiny spark within this old man's heart.${prompt};
And the more I listened to her, the larger it grew, until eventually that raging flame drove me to a decision.${prompt};
I, too, would venture out into the world as an adventurer.${prompt};
I couldn't believe it when he suddenly blurted out that he wanted to be an adventurer.${prompt};
I argued with him, of course.${prompt};
But, you know...it was hard to deny that spark in his eye.${prompt};
I had never seen him look so alive.${prompt};
Bernahn had saved me from a life of misery.;
If there was anything I could do to repay him...${prompt};
...I wanted to do it.${prompt};
The plan was simple: Pretend to be taking a walk in the garden, and then slip out the gate...${prompt};
We had all sorts of trouble after that!${prompt};
Galiwao and the others came after us like bloodhounds.${prompt};
They were on our trail the entire time!${prompt};
Staking out all our possible routes...alerting all the townspeople to our disappearance...${prompt};
I never thought these aged legs could keep me on the run for so long!${prompt};
It's your support that has helped me through this.${prompt};
I never could have done any of this without you, Faihal.${prompt};
I want you to have this...${prompt};
What is it...?${prompt};
This is a document transferring ownership of the mansion to you.;
Signed and sealed.${prompt};
!?${prompt};
Please divide my remaining wealth among you and the Galka.${prompt};
This way you'll be free to live as you please, without having to answer to any master.${prompt};
The time for your own adventures has come.${prompt};
Thank you for everything, Faihal.${prompt};
...;
......;
Go. Do as you please.${prompt};
I will.;
I've chosen to go...${prompt};
...with you.${prompt};
I want to go with you!;
What!?;
I still have so much to repay you for!${prompt};
I don't need your fortune!;
I don't need a safe, secure life!${prompt};
But...${prompt};
I'm going!${prompt};
I'm going with you, and that's final!${prompt};
It doesn't matter what you say, I'll follow you anyway!${prompt};
You can't stop me...;
Ahahaha...${prompt};
She's like the daughter I never had, with twice my stubbornness!${prompt};
Faihal, you really have brought joy to my life.${prompt};
I was nervous about this decision.${prompt};
Nervous about leaving the mansion...;
But more than that...${prompt};
I was anxious about leaving you.${prompt};
Bernahn...${prompt};
So, you'll come with me, Faihal?${prompt};
On this grand adventure?${prompt};
Then it's settled.;
Please take this. It's a letter to my faithful retainers.${prompt};
I'm sure they're in Nashmau right now, turning the town upside-down!${prompt};
I apologize for deceiving you.;
Thank you again for your assistance.${prompt};
Say goodbye to those blockheads for me, and...${prompt};
...thank you.${prompt};
Mew mew mew mew mew meooow♪ Tulutululu～♪ Meow!${prompt};

${color-alt: 121}Ahkk Jharcham has unknowingly provided you with information on the back alleys of Al Zahbi! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.${prompt};
Grrr... What a nosy person!;
And you have the nerve to “meow” me on top of everything!${prompt};
Grrr...${prompt};
Oh well. You gave me the parchment in the first place, so I guess I have to forrrgive you.${prompt};
You can't tell anyone about this. Cross your hearrrt, meow!;
${color-alt: 121}You have learned your way through the back alleys of Al Zahbi! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.${prompt};
Meow? You want to give me something? Unforrrtunately, I'm not cheap! (At least, that's what Mom always says...)${prompt};
Thanks, but I don't need any morrre parchment. Oh well, it's the thought that counts! (At least, that's what Mom always says...)${prompt};

Welcome to the Commissions Agency.;
Our main function is to commission mercenaries with the tasks set forth by the Imperial Government.${prompt};
Welcome to the Commissions Agency.;
Are you seeking employment?;
We have an abundance of commissions for the hardy mercenary!${prompt};
Welcome to the Commissions Agency.;
Our commissions are only available to authorized mercenaries of level 50 or above.;
Please return when you meet the necessary requirements.${prompt};
Welcome to the Commissions Agency.${prompt};
You have completed mercenary registration procedures?;
One moment, please.${prompt};
I have you registered as “${name-player}” under Salaheem's Sentinels.;
Your paperwork appears to be in order.${prompt};
I shall now give you an explanation of “Assault,” the main type of work we have available here at the Commissions Agency.${prompt};
“Assault” is the name given to a series of missions being conducted by the Imperial Army in the heart of enemy territory.${prompt};
Our function is to commission mercenaries with these missions as set forth by the Empire.${prompt};
To participate in an Assault mission, you must first obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will identify you as a legitimate Assault participant.${prompt};
The personnel at this counter will provide you with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, but please be aware that only one can be issued every ${choice: 1}[day/ten minutes] (Earth time), and we are only able to hold up to three for you.${prompt};
Mercenaries that have a confirmed mission will not be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
To once again become eligible to receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, please report to this counter after completing an Assault mission.${prompt};
Next, I shall explain how to sign up for an Assault mission.${prompt};
You will see a number of counters here to your left.${prompt};
Each of these counters is responsible for a particular Assault area.${prompt};
The personnel at these counters will give you a detailed explanation of the available Assault missions.${prompt};
However, you will only be able to undertake Assault missions that correspond to your mercenary rank. The Commissions Agency is prohibited by Imperial law from disclosing mission information to persons without the proper level of clearance.${prompt};
After selecting a mission, present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for verification.${prompt};
Assault missions are only open to mercenaries of level 50 or above. Please be sure your job is of the appropriate level before signing up.${prompt};
This concludes the explanation for Assault participation.;
Next, I will list some points to remember when beginning an Assault mission.${prompt};
Assault missions have a minimum member requirement.;
This figure represents the number of party members who must be present in order to begin the mission.${prompt};
Please form a party with a sufficient number of members who have all signed up for the same Assault mission. ${prompt};
After forming a party, make your way to the mission staging point located at the entrance to the applicable Assault area.${prompt};
To facilitate a speedy journey to the staging point, I would suggest utilizing the “runic portal” within the “Chamber of Passage” located opposite this building.${prompt};
Please be aware that in order to utilize the runic portal from the Chamber of Passage, you must first attune yourself to the runic portal found at the staging point in question.${prompt};
Under normal circumstances, use of the runic portal will deplete your Imperial Standing. However, persons in possession of Assault orders are exempt from this charge.${prompt};
Upon arriving at the staging point, a representative from your Assault party should speak with the Immortal on duty to receive verification of command.${prompt};
The verified representative should then activate the “runic seal” at the entrance to begin the Assault mission.${prompt};
This concludes the basics for beginning an Assault mission.;
Next, we will cover the main points to consider during the mission itself.${prompt};
When an Assault mission begins, you will be transported to an area where the level of enemies is based on the highest-level member of your party.${prompt};
It is also possible to accept a voluntary level restriction during Assault. In this case, your party will be sent to an area based upon the adjusted level limit.${prompt};
Once you have arrived in the area, the time limit for the mission will be announced. If you do not complete the mission objectives within this time, the mission will be considered a failure.${prompt};
To successfully complete a mission, it is necessary to activate the “rune of release” that appears after the mission objectives have been fulfilled.${prompt};
It is possible to abandon a mission and be transported out of the Assault area by using homing fireflies to guide you. Naturally, the mission will be considered a failure in this case.${prompt};
Before being transported to the Assault area, all party members will be issued with homing fireflies.${prompt};
Homing fireflies are temporary items that cannot be taken out of an Assault area.${prompt};
Other temporary items will also be available during Assault missions.${prompt};
This concludes the Assault mission explanation.;
Lastly, I will give you an overview of the rewards available upon successfully completing an Assault mission.${prompt};
After successfully completing an Assault mission, the Empire will award you with Assault Points.${prompt};
These points are only awarded for participation in Assault missions, and are accumulated separately for each Assault area.${prompt};
Each area has specific items available that can be purchased in exchange for Assault Points.${prompt};
You can check your Assault Point totals and purchase items from the counters to your left.${prompt};
Thank you for visiting the Commissions Agency.;

Allow me to explain the mission list notations.${prompt};
Selecting “View mission list” will display a list of mission titles.${prompt};
Once a mission has been selected, you will see the following notations under the mission title:;
“Objective” and “Recruitment.”${prompt};
“Objective” refers to the condition that must be fulfilled in order for the mission to succeed.${prompt};
After completing a mission objective, a “Rune of Release” will appear within the area. Activating the Rune of Release will signify the successful completion of the mission.${prompt};
“Recruitment” refers to the level and number of mercenaries being recruited for the mission. The level displayed is a suggestion only, and any mission can be undertaken by a mercenary of level 50 or above.${prompt};
However, signing up for a mission of a level lower than your own will earn less Assault points from the Empire.${prompt};
The number range displayed represents the minimum and maximum number of mercenaries allowed for the mission.${prompt};
You must meet the minimum number requirement in order to begin an Assault mission.${prompt};
This concludes the explanation of mission list notations.${prompt};
Is there anything else I can help you with?${prompt};
Thank you for visiting the Commissions Agency.${prompt};
Eh? What d'you want?${prompt};
Shamarhaan told you about me?${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.${prompt};
I don't have my automaton anymore...${prompt};
A puppetmaster without an automaton is like a Goblin without a mask!${prompt};
...Did you just ask me what a Goblin without a mask is like?${prompt};
Do you know what happened to the last person who asked me that?${prompt};
......${prompt};
......${prompt};
I'm not telling you. Just remember, you don't want it to happen to you. Now get lost.${prompt};
You want to ask about puppeteering anyway?;
Talk about not taking a hint...${prompt};
Is any of this getting through to you?;
I can't talk about puppeteering without an automaton!${prompt};
Can you talk about the beauty of the Mithra without their ears and tail? Of course not! And this is the same type of thing!${prompt};
I'm nothing without ears and a ta--no no, without my automaton! See? Now you're confusing me!${prompt};
That's why I can't talk to you about Mith--no, no! Argh! I can't think straight!${prompt};
I need an automaton, or I can't even speak correctly!${prompt};
Bring me an automaton, and then we can talk!${prompt};
Got it? Now get out of here! Out, out!${prompt};
Do you need anything?;
...An automaton?${prompt};
I am using all of the models here for my research. I can't go giving them out for free, you know?${prompt};
But if you really must have one...${wait-36: 2};
I suppose I could give you an automaton in exchange for helping me with my research.${prompt};
I am currently in the process of reviewing the very fundamentals of automaton technology.${prompt};
And to that purpose, I require one of the automatons that I developed in the past.${prompt};
You see, each time I finish a new automaton, I present it to a puppetmaster.${prompt};
As a result, not a single model of my older work remains in this workshop.${prompt};
A lot has befallen me here in Aht Urhgan, and I'm afraid I no longer even possess the blueprints from my earlier projects.${prompt};
If you could just find one of my previous models and bring it to me, I could finish my study...${prompt};
I can also improve the automaton and forge it into a brand-new model. And then...I will even give it to you!${prompt};
Not a bad deal, is it?${prompt};
I am fairly certain that some old models of mine are lying dormant somewhere on Arrapago Reef.${prompt};
Long ago, I developed a type of armored automaton soldier to be used in battles against the Lamiae on Arrapago Reef.${prompt};
However, the tables turned when the Lamiae began controlling the automatons, and the operation was a failure.${prompt};
Whatever is left of the automatons may still be found in the area.${prompt};
In any case, I would recommend starting your search there.${prompt};
So if you're serious about helping me, I suggest you head to Arrapago Reef now.${prompt};
Why, you managed to find quite an aged model.${prompt};
And the older the better, when it comes to my research.${prompt};
I thank you for your work. This will do nicely.${prompt};
It may take some time to research and customize this automaton...${prompt};
But I know how long you've been waiting, so I'll try to finish up as soon as I possibly can.${prompt};
Just wait until you see what I can do with this baby...${prompt};
Sorry for the wait.${prompt};
Here's the automaton I promised you. I've upgraded it to the newest model.${prompt};
This model was a prototype. I remembered a great deal while studying it.${prompt};
The data was extremely helpful, and is certain to prompt great progress in my research.${prompt};
I hope you will find the automaton just as invaluable, as it now belongs to you.${prompt};
Take good care of it, now.${prompt};
......${prompt};
You again? What do you want now?${prompt};
Y-y-you brought me an a-a-automaton!?${prompt};
F-for...m-m-me!?${prompt};
......${prompt};
......${prompt};
No no no...I...I can't possibly accept this.${prompt};
Until recently, I was considered the top puppeteer on Urhguum, so I know how they work...;
This automaton won't work with anyone but you. Try it out, and you'll see what I mean.${prompt};
My automaton only worked for me, and I couldn't have performed with another automaton, either. You form a sort of bond, you see.${prompt};
What? Does that create a problem for you?;
Oh, yes...I did mention that I can't talk about puppeteering without an automaton, didn't I?${prompt};
I was just saying that to get rid of you.${prompt};
Don't get me wrong. I was completely serious about not being able to talk about Mithra if there are no ears or tail involved...${prompt};
Um, anyway, what did you want to ask me about puppeteering?${prompt};
Or did you come to ask me how Goblins look under their masks?${prompt};
You see, about that...${prompt};
Oh? You were more interested in puppeteering after all?${prompt};
You want to know what it takes to become a puppetmaster, do you?${prompt};
I don't know what you're talking about...${prompt};
You're already a puppetmaster!${prompt};
You have your own automaton. That's proof!${prompt};
Huh? Shamarhaan told you you can't operate an automaton if you're not a puppetmaster?${prompt};
Hmph, he's just making stuff up.${prompt};
Well...come to think of it, he does have a point.;
If you can't let the automaton know what you're thinking, it's not going to move.${prompt};
I've got something to help you with that... Ah, here it is!${prompt};
You can use this controller... Now, try pushing here.${prompt};
See?;
Now it knows what you're thinking!${prompt};
And the more you work together, the more responsive it will become to your commands!${prompt};
You can use this ${item-singular: 1[2]} to give direction to your automaton!${prompt};
Oh! And you should give your automaton a name, too. It's all yours now, so you get to decide!${prompt};
Choose your automaton's name.;

You don't have enough gil! Get lost!${prompt};
Oh, nice choice!;
Congratulations on your new name!${prompt};
Your automaton has a new name.${prompt};
Are you sure this name is okay?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, this is it.;
On second thought...;
Cancel.${prompt};
What? You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
Well... I suppose I can provide you with a spare if you pay me 10000 gil.${prompt};
You better not lose it again.${prompt};
Oh, it's you...just when I needed some help, too. You've got great timing, you know that?${prompt};
I want you to help me look for my automaton.${prompt};
What?;
You mean I never told you that my automaton was stolen?${prompt};
I still remember it like it was yesterday...${prompt};
It was not long before I met you...${prompt};
In an effort to gather knowledge on my audience, I made it a point to observe the people at Balrahn Way each day.${prompt};
On this particular day, I headed out for the crowds as always...${prompt};
That's when tragedy struck.${prompt};
Oh oh, and you wouldn't belieeeve...${prompt};
Haha, that's a wig? Get out of here! Are you serious?${prompt};
And you should see that other guy...${prompt};
No way! Why would he be wearing a fake beard? What's the point?${prompt};
And for some reason, that guy...${prompt};
Have you ever seen that guy's sideburns? Out of this world!${prompt};
Hahaha, where did you manage to find such a ridiculous person?${prompt};
Oh, come on. You know! He's always at that teahouse...the big lout...${prompt};
...${prompt};
...That's...my father.${prompt};
...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Well, ummm... Today's teatime's on me, okay?${prompt};
What would you like, coffee or chai?${prompt};
...Just leave me alone...${prompt};
...And that was it.${prompt};
Everything happened so fast... I lost track of the two girls while searching for my automaton.${prompt};
Where could they have gone?${prompt};
Oh yeah, it was later that I met someone who witnessed the whole thing...and that's how I found out my automaton was actually stolen.${prompt};
Well? Do you think you could help me find it?${prompt};
You understand how difficult it would be to have your automaton torn away from you, don't you?${prompt};
Sympathize with him?;
${selection-lines};
Must be terrible...;
No.;Non.
...${prompt};
And it is! I knew you'd understand!${prompt};
How can you say that? Think! Just think about it for a while! Imagine my pain!${prompt};
Sympathize with him?;
${selection-lines};
You poor thing...;
Whatever.${prompt};
Your hesitation is a little suspicious...but thanks for your sympathy!${prompt};
Oh please! Just think about it a little more!${prompt};
All right, then.;
You go check Nashmau. Leave Al Zahbi to me.${prompt};
And remember, we're not just looking for the thief. I want my automaton back, too!${prompt};
Ack, I almost left out some important information!;
Let me describe my automaton and the thief to you...${prompt};
My automaton is...ummm... Well, let's just say you'll know it when you see it.${prompt};
It looks just like a normal automaton, but the way it acts is completely unique. You'll notice it immediately.${prompt};
Anyway, just be careful.${prompt};
I've heard that the thief is a bald Hume. Finding him might lead you to the automaton.${prompt};
I want to know where he is and what he's doing. If you find anything, don't mess around--come straight to me.${prompt};
Remember, I'm counting on you! Good luck, and be careful!${prompt};
You should head for Nashmau. Good luck, and be careful.${prompt};
So how did it go? No luck at all here...${prompt};
Everyone in this town just has a different shape to their hips...totally not what I'm looking for...;
Ah, of course I'm talking about automatons!${prompt};
So you couldn't find anything either, could you?${prompt};
What!?;
You found an automaton that fit my description?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
An automaton with a foul mouth...fluent in the common tongue...${prompt};
And accompanied by a bald Hume? That sounds like...no, that must be my automaton!${prompt};
Well, how was it? Did everything seem okay?${prompt};
What!?;
It had the bald Hume at its beck and call?${prompt};
...I should have known.;
I was a fool for worrying.${prompt};
Anyway, just knowing that my automaton is well is all the information I need for now.${prompt};
Thanks for your help. Here's a little token of thanks for your time.${prompt};
Master Shamarhaan gave this to me, but I've never had the chance to use it... You'd probably appreciate it more than I could.${prompt};
If anything else comes up, just let me know!${prompt};
It's a foolproof plan! I'm a genius!${prompt};
Oh...you again!;
You always have such great timing...${prompt};
I've been thinking of a way to get my automaton back.${prompt};
It would be nice if this could all be solved by talking it out, but the thief knows me... As soon as he catches sight of my face, he's sure to take off at top speed.${prompt};
It would bring all our efforts to nothing if he escaped, so I've been hard at work formulating a foolproof strategy to recover what is rightfully mine.${prompt};
I can't do it without you, though. You will help me, right?${prompt};
Help him out?;
${selection-lines};
Of course!;
Don't feel like it...${prompt};
It's settled, then!;
First, we've got to make the preparations...${prompt};
I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Give them to me as soon as you can find them. In the meantime, I'll be busy gathering the other necessary items...${prompt};
I'll let you know the details of the plan after the preparations are complete. Good luck!${prompt};
Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and I'll explain to you my plan.${prompt};
This is exactly what I needed! Thanks! I've finished my preparations, too.${prompt};
Okay, just let me confirm one thing...;
You've managed to get in the thief's good graces, right?${prompt};
So... I want you to invite him for a cup of tea.${prompt};
He must always keep the automaton where he can keep his eye on it so I can't get it back.${prompt};
All we have to do is slip something into his drink to make him sleep and take the automaton while he's out!${prompt};
He knows my face, so I need you to lure him in.${prompt};
I'll set up a teahouse at the port in Nashmau.${prompt};
I've already prepared all kinds of fancy teahouse materials just for the occasion. It wasn't easy, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.${prompt};
Now...let the games begin! I'll let you handle the invitation!${prompt};
What are you still doing here? The thief is in Nashmau, right? I went through a lot to set up that teahouse, so you better make sure the thief gets there!${prompt};
...${prompt};
I know, I know.;
I've got to go get Ellie...${prompt};
But...I just can't bring myself to do it. Even if I go, she's just going to say the exact same things.${prompt};
And she's right. I can't put on shows like Ellie can. I can't do anything by myself.${prompt};
I'm a failure... I mean, have you ever heard of a puppetmaster rejected by his own automaton?${prompt};
How could Master Shamarhaan ever have decided I was fit for this trade?${prompt};
I wonder how I can make Ellie appreciate me again... I wonder if Master Shamarhaan would have any good advice...${prompt};
Iruki-Waraki!${prompt};
Huh?;
Oh, it's you...${prompt};
Just how long do you plan to make me wait!? My heart and my body can't take it anymore!${prompt};
Today I managed to slip off while the automaton wasn't looking and make it here in one piece...${prompt};
If that thing ever sees me again, my life is over! I can never go back now!${prompt};
Go! Go take your automaton back now!${prompt};
But...I...${prompt};
"You don't think you can do it, do you? Don't worry; I have a plan!${prompt}";
You do?${prompt};
First, you need to head for the port at Nashmau. Once you get there, I'll explain everything. There's no time... You must hurry!${prompt};
...${prompt};
I don't have much of a choice, do I? I guess I'll head for Nashmau, then...${prompt};
There you are!${prompt};
Ellie has something she wants to talk to you about.${prompt};
I heard Iruki's been making you do all his dirty work.${prompt};
And uh, anyway, I thought that I'd give you this to make up for it.${prompt};
I don't even remember where I got it from, but Iruki says it looks like puppetmaster gear. You could probably use it, yeah?${prompt};
I wish I could remember how I got ahold of it... Why would an automaton have clothes designed for a person, anyway?${prompt};
Anyway, whatever. Good luck, and bye.${prompt};
${name-player}, thanks so much for everything! I really appreciate it... Come back and say hi anytime!${prompt};
Hey, ${name-player}.;
How's everything going?${prompt};
I'm taking a little break from work right now and spending some time with Ellie.${prompt};
Your automaton will start to get sulky if you don't pay it enough attention, you know.${prompt};
There's been a sudden incrrrease in the number of puppetmasters lately. There are way too many for my liking now.${prompt};
That's why I'm picky about who I do business with. People say, “The customer is always right,” don't they? But I say, the customer better be rrright, or I'm not sellin'!${prompt};
Hey, you.;
You wouldn't happen to know anything about my products, would you?${prompt};
I come from a family that's been making puppetmaster gear for many generations, back to when the puppeteering trade was in its infancy.${prompt};
The quality of the gear is topnotch and only given to a select few. The very fact that you know about what I do speaks for your prrrowess as a puppetmaster.${prompt};
So... How about it?;
If you want this gear, just ask and I'll make it for you.${prompt};
However... It's gonna cost you. The materials aren't easy to come by, either, and it'll be you who has to go collect them. All I can do is put 'em together.${prompt};
But if you succeed, you'll be the proud owner of a magnificent piece of equipment. It should be a walk in the park for you, rrright?${prompt};
So, what'll it be?${prompt};
What do you want me to make?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;Rien.
Oh? Where's the fun in that?${prompt};
You surrre?${prompt};
You're rrreally sure?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I'm sure!;
Maybe not...${prompt};
Well then, what do ya want?${prompt};
All rrright! You'll need to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, then!${prompt};
I'll also need ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]} to show your appreciation for my hard work! Good luck!${prompt};
I'll also need ${number: 9} ${item-given-plurality: 9[2], 8[2]} to show your appreciation for my hard work! Good luck!${prompt};
How many times do I have to tell you? I need ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!${prompt};
Oh yeah, and don't forget to throw in ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]}. Hop to it, now!${prompt};
Oh yeah, and don't forget to throw in ${number: 9} ${item-given-plurality: 9[2], 8[2]}. Hop to it, now!${prompt};
Excellent work.${prompt};
Leave everything to me, now. Just wait until you see how beautiful and strong the final product will be!${prompt};
I won't be able to finish it today, so you should find something else to keep you busy and leave me to work in peace.${prompt};
What do you want?;
Patience is a virtue, you know.${prompt};
Your order is ready!${prompt};
Just let me know if you want anything else. You won't find products like this anywhere else on Urhguum, believe me.${prompt};
Did you want anything else?${prompt};
It looks like you've completed the set now!${prompt};
You must rrreally like my work to have gone through all that trouble. I'm flattered!${prompt};
To tell the truth, there are more parts to this series of equipment, but my rrrelatives passed away of old age before teaching me how to make them.${prompt};
In fact, I'm the only one left who deals in this type of gear now.${prompt};
My family passed down all of our secrets to one more person, but apparently she chose not to make it her life's work.${prompt};
Anyway, that just means that the equipment is extremely rrrare. If you want it, you are going to have to look hard...${prompt};
I hope you succeed!${prompt};
Corporal ${name-player}!${prompt};
...${prompt};
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?${prompt};
Respond to Naja?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, ma'am!;
Wait a minute...${prompt};
Well, well, this is a surprise... So ya respond to “Corporal” ${name-player}, do ya, Sergeant?${prompt};
Looks like it's still too early for a prrromotion, eh?${prompt};
So bein' a Sergeant has finally settled into that thick skull o' yours, has it?${prompt};
Well then, why don't ya show me what a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your rrrank can do, now?${prompt};
Abquhbah!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
Bring in the rookies!${prompt};
You mean the three employees whose service you have found rather...disappointing?${prompt};
Don't you question your superior! Who else would I be talkin' about?${prompt};
I-I will be right back with them!${prompt};
H-here they are!${prompt};
Private Third Class Qarimul reporting...;
Private Third Class Warjal reporting...;
Private Third Class Zaldur reporting...;
Wonderin' about their rrrank, are ya? These three haven't contributed a lick to our company's growth. You're lookin' at the bottom of this company's barrel.${prompt};
I made the rank “Private Third Class” just for them.${prompt};
Want to know how much these worms have accomplished so far?${prompt};
Commissions successfully completed: 3!${prompt};
This includes...${prompt};
Picking up trash around the fountain a total of one time!${prompt};
Cleaning graffiti off of the fountain a total of one time!${prompt};
And scrubbing the fountain a total of one time!${prompt};
The profit margin sent to us by the commissions agency was...${prompt};
Enough!${prompt};
As you can see, I've gotta think of somethin' new for this rrramshackle crew before we end up with the rank “Private Fourth Class.”${prompt};
Seems the only option left is to lock 'em up in the barracks for a while, though.${prompt};
That's where you come in, ${name-player}!♪;
I'm makin' it your job to whip these boys into shape!${prompt};
Ya better get used to their faces, 'cause you're gonna be their new boss.${prompt};
In other words, it's your rrresponsibility to make sure they get a proper education!${prompt};
Prove to me that you're up to the task of bein' a good sergeant!${prompt};
First of all, a mercenary should have strength. Let's start with some basic exercises.${prompt};
Now, keep in mind the worms we're dealing with'd have to fight to pull off a single chin-up, so we've gotta start from the very beginning.${prompt};
In this case, that's push-ups.;
Well, ${name-player}, have at 'em!${prompt};
Um... If...if I might say a word...${prompt};
What'd ya want now?${prompt};
I-I may be mistaken, but this seems to be Sergeant ${name-player}'s first time training subordinates.${prompt};
Do you think that, possibly, this all might be a little sudden for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt};
Grrr... I guess you've got a point.;
All rrright then, watch me first and let me show ya how it's done.${prompt};
But ya better pay close attention! Take note if any of 'em start to slack off!${prompt};
Got it?${prompt};
Ya know what to do?;
${selection-lines};
Leave it to me!;
Huh...?${prompt};
(Basically, she wants you to count and make sure that everyone does the number of push-ups she asked for.)${prompt};
You're gonna do ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[push-up/push-ups] for me, got it? Starting now!${prompt};
That's enough!${prompt};
Well then, Sergeant ${name-player}, did ya notice anyone goofing off? Did everyone do all their push-ups?${prompt};
Who messed up?;
${selection-lines};
They were all fine.;
Qarimul.;
Warjal.;
Zaldur.${prompt};
Good!${prompt};
I don't think we can squeeze any more out of them... Training adjourned!${prompt};
Wrong! To think that although these rrrookies worked so hard, you were the one slackin' off!${prompt};
So, Private Third Class ${choice: 1}[Qarimul/Warjal/Zaldur]... You've got guts, slackin' off rrright in front of Naja here, don't ya?${prompt};
Just what the hell were ya lookin' at?${prompt};
${choice: 1}[Qarimul/Warjal/Zaldur], ya might've fooled this incompetent adventurer here, but ya can't fool me, slacker!${prompt};
Eep...!;
I-I'm sorry, boss!!!${prompt};
These rookies are your rrresponsibility, Sergeant! You will report back to me ASAP and continue until ya make yourself useful! Do I make myself clear?${prompt};
Looks like you're on your toes today, ${name-player}. Purrrfect...this means I can give you even more work from now on!${prompt};
What?;
You can't expect a worm to become a wildcat just like that, can ya?${prompt};
Great mercenaries are the rrresult of years of hard training!${prompt};
So I expect to see ya back here soon, brrright-eyed and bushy-tailed! Capice?${prompt};
Look lively, now! Get ready for anotherrr delightful training session!♪${prompt};
Keep an eye out for any slackers, now! Got it?${prompt};
Good to see ya, ${name-player}.${prompt};
It seems you've become prrretty infamous lately. I've been hearing snippets about a ruthless sergeant who won't tolerate the sight of slackers!${prompt};
Abquhbah! Where are those rookies!?${prompt};
I'll be right back with them, ma'am!${prompt};
This time I wanna see ya doing sit-ups!${prompt};
After that unsynchronized mess of a training exercise ya managed last time, I've decided to give ya signals so you can stay together this time!${prompt};
${name-player}!;
It will be your job to give the signals!${prompt};
You've gotta time the signals right, understood? Give them too fast or too slow...${prompt};
...and I'll hold you responsible for scrrrewin' up the exercise!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Naja Salaheem examines Abquhbah.;
...?;
(Sh-she's never looked at me this way before... Be still, my heart!)${prompt};
Abquhbah.${prompt};
Y-yes...?;
What would you have of me, ma'am?${prompt};
Take off your clothes.${prompt};
Wh-what!? M-may I ask why, ma'am...?;
(I never knew she would be this bold!)${prompt};
We've gotta make a demonstration for our slow learners here, or they'll never get it.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am! A demonstration...as you say!${prompt};
S-so, that means...you want me to do sit-ups... Is that correct...?${prompt};
What else would I be talkin' about!? Get your work clothes off and get on the floor, now!${prompt};
You can give a signal at the message advancement prompt. Naja's “Start!” will serve as the first signal.${prompt};
Are ya rrready, Abquhbah?${prompt};
...I-I suppose...${prompt};
Let's start with 10, all right? Ready...${prompt};
Start!${prompt};
${number: 0}${prompt};
Think ya got the hang of it now?${prompt};
Got the hang of it?;
${selection-lines};
Piece of cake!;
Not yet...${prompt};
Let's try again, then!${prompt};
Nooo!${prompt};
Is...is it over, then...?${prompt};
I'd say you haven't been gettin' enough training yourself, Abquhbah.${prompt};
B-but...I deal with personnel, not monsters!${prompt};
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, practice is over. Now it's time for the rrreal deal!${prompt};
We've got three rookies, so you'll wanna time your signals so they all match up. Understood?${prompt};
(Basically, you don't want anyone to fall behind, so you need to give a signal whenever everyone has his back on the ground. Okay?)${prompt};
All right, then! Ready...${prompt};
Can't ya do any better than that!?${prompt};
Ya might as well paint a target on your backs for the enemy for all the good this is doing! Come back when you've washed the stupid out of yer skulls...and this time, ya better do it right!${prompt};
(Oh no... She isn't going to make me do sit-ups all over again too, is she?)${prompt};
You are to time your signals so that all three rookies are doing their sit-ups at the same time. Got it?${prompt};
Understood?;
${selection-lines};
Got it!;
What was that?;
I want to practice.${prompt};
I spoil ya rrrotten, don't I?;
Abquhbah, get over here!${prompt};
Yipe! Errr...y-yes, ma'am!;
(Not again!)${prompt};
Not bad, not bad.;
Hopefully you'll do just as well next time!${prompt};
Um, B-Boss... We do have a schedule, you see, and spending so much time on this may not be...well...wise...${prompt};
Salaheem's Sentinels is the pride of Aht Urhgan! Ya think mercenaries of our caliber can be made in a matter of days!?${prompt};
...That's what I'd like to say, anyway, but I'm a busy woman.${prompt};
All rrright, then.;
Next time I'll leave everything to you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Slack off, and your rrrecord will show for it!${prompt};
Ya know what everyone's callin' ya lately thanks to your grrreat work? “The Sadistic Sergeant”! I'm so prrroud of ya!${prompt};
Now I've got other business to attend to this time, but I expect you to maintain your rrreputation!${prompt};
President Naja has informed me of our present training schedule...${prompt};
...which will consist of running on Balrahn Way.${prompt};
${name-player} will lead the exercises, urging on anyone who falls behind.${prompt};
These are the orders given by President Naja.${prompt};
Now I will step down and let ${name-player} command.${prompt};
I can leave the rest up to you, correct?${prompt};
Are you ready?;Es-tu prêt?
${selection-lines};
Ready as I'll ever be!;
No... I'm confused.${prompt};
I will leave the training to you, then.${prompt};
My role will be limited to giving the starting signal. On your marks, please.${prompt};
But President Naja appointed you...and I have no intention of running mysel--errr, nothing...${prompt};
Your role is simply to urge on those who fall behind during the exercise. If everybody stays together, you won't have to do a thing.${prompt};
Do you think you can handle the task?${prompt};
Oh, and one last comment. Be sure not to be too demanding, or nobody will be able to keep up.${prompt};
All right, let's begin.;
On your marks, get set...${prompt};
Go!${prompt};
Urge someone on?;
${selection-lines};
Not now.;
Qarimul.;
Warjal.;
Zaldur.${prompt};
It looks like someone fell behind...${prompt};
Hm...well, I suppose we could try to keep it a secret... (But if President Naja happened to be watching from somewhere...<gulp>...)${prompt};
I suppose you had better try again later.${prompt};
I'm sure you'll do better next time, ${name-player}!${prompt};
You're still training? I'm imprrressed!${prompt};
Well then, shall we begin, ${name-player}?${prompt};
I can leave the rest up to you again, correct?${prompt};
Great work! It looks like this training session has been successfully concluded.${prompt};
So, next time...ah, what shall we do?${prompt};
In any case, I had better report to President Naja now...${prompt};
You were fantastic out there. Please come see us again soon!${prompt};
There you are, Sergeant ${name-player}!${prompt};
What're ya shiverin' for? Seems ya did a great job yesterday!${prompt};
Abquhbah! Bring them in!${prompt};
Just look at them, ${name-player}!;
To think that ya could make a bunch of green rrrookies into these hard-boiled mercenaries!${prompt};
You all are changed men now. How does it feel?${prompt};
I got a girlfriend thanks to my training!${prompt};
I grew an ilm taller thanks to my training!${prompt};
I made a fortune thanks to my training!${prompt};
Looks like I've got even more material to add to our company pamphlets, eh?${prompt};
You've prrroved yourself a great sergeant, ${name-player}! So great, in fact, that I don't think the title of Sergeant fits ya anymore!${prompt};
Look sharp, Sergeant ${name-player}!${prompt};
From this day forward you will be known as a Sergeant Major!${prompt};
...Which means I'll be expecting even more from ya now.♪${prompt};
Congratulations!${prompt};
(Really, though...those three have improved remarkably in the past few days...)${prompt};
(Could you have been a famous adventurer or something before you joined us...?)${prompt};
Wake up, Abquhbah!;
I expect you to do double your typical load today in celebration of ${name-player}'s promotion!${prompt};
(Nah... I must just be imagining things...)${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Sergeant Major!${prompt};
This is the reception counter for Assault missions within the Nyzul Isle remnants.${prompt};
However, Nyzul Isle has yet to be recognized as an official Assault area by the Imperial army.${prompt};
As a result, missions completed on Nyzul Isle will not earn you Assault Points.;
Please be aware of this fact before signing up.${prompt};
How may I help you?;
${selection-lines};
View mission list.;
Vending box explanation.;
Confirm tokens.;
Confirm completed floors.;
Mission list explanation.;
I'm fine, thanks.${prompt};
Investigators are frequently coming across artifacts within the remnants we are simply calling Nyzul “tokens.”;
As a way of gauging your progress, the Commissions Agency will keep track of the number of tokens you have obtained.${prompt};
You currently possess ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[token/tokens].${prompt};
You have currently investigated up to Floor ${number: 4} of the Nyzul Isle remnants.${prompt};
You have currently investigated up to Floor ${number: 4} of the Nyzul Isle remnants as part of the Nyzul Isle Investigation.${prompt};
Furthermore, you have investigated up to Floor ${number: 5} of the Nyzul Isle uncharted region.${prompt};
However, mission objectives within the Nyzul Isle remnants are handled with the utmost confidentiality. Your mission orders will all be received from the on-site Assault commander.${prompt};
The remnants on Nyzul Isle are divided into multiple floors. Once you have completed the objective received on a particular floor, the Assault commander will activate the Rune of Transfer.${prompt};
Once the Rune of Transfer has been activated, you will have the choice of proceeding to the next floor, or suspending the mission and leaving the Assault area.${prompt};
"Do not be concerned; your mission will automatically be considered a success as long as the Rune of Transfer is used to exit the Assault area, no matter the floor.${prompt}";
Lastly, the objective for each floor will be relayed to you by the Assault commander via the Rune of Transfer.${prompt};
However, since it is not possible to impose level restrictions within the Nyzul Isle Assault area, it is best to recruit members of the suggested level.${prompt};
Congratulations.;
Please speak to Sorrowful Sage to confirm your current number of Nyzul tokens.${prompt};
Your mission was not successful.;
I regret to inform you that the Imperial Army does not officially recognize your efforts within this Assault area.${prompt};
Furthermore, in recognition of your outstanding efforts in service to the Empire, the Commissions Agency will now hold an extra ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for your exclusive use. We look forward to your continued success.${prompt};
Vending boxes, you say?;
How may I help you?${prompt};
How may I help you?;
${selection-lines};
Set preferences.;
Vending box overview.;
Never mind.${prompt};
No doubt you have noticed the curious caskets scattered throughout the Nyzul Isle remnants.;
Our operatives have come to refer to these as “vending boxes.”${prompt};
Depositing Nyzul tokens into them will yield artifacts usable only in the immediate environs.;
By what ancient technology or magic they operate, we do not know.${prompt};
And yet our research has not proved entirely fruitless.${prompt};
Specifically, we have developed a means to manipulate these boxes so that your preferred items may be extracted with greater ease.${prompt};
I would explain further, but the inner workings of this are beyond a layman like me.;
Simply convey to me your preferences, and enjoy the newfound convenience on your next expedition.${prompt};
Select a category.;

Welcome to the Nyzul Isle field station of the Aht Urhgan Archaeological Research Institute.;
It is here that we conduct our most pioneering research, undeterred by the threat of danger that lurks in every nook of these ruins.${prompt};
I am not authorized to converse with civilians.;
Please be on your way.${prompt};

Which item do you wish to purchase?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Without ${keyitem-article: 38[2]} in your possession, we cannot offer you ${article} ${item-article: 39[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, astraria! Remarkable relics of an era long forgotten!${prompt};
Ancient astronomical clocks, they are, once used by the denizens of these parts to predict changes in the weather and seasons...or so we surmise.${prompt};
Though the astraria we have unearthed have been far too weathered and waterlogged to serve their original function, they have proven a veritable treasure trove of insight into the civilization that created them.${prompt};
To call them the key to answering questions we have pondered for so long is no understatement.${prompt};
“What does this have to do with me,” you ask?;
An astute question, if I do say so myself!${prompt};
My colleagues and I are but humble students of archaeology.;
We have neither the courage nor the wherewithal to venture into the depths to recover the artifacts so vital to our research.${prompt};
Thus we are dependent on mercenaries like yourself.;
We would be greatly in your debt if you could recover and return to us any astraria you might come across in your travels.${prompt};
A single astrarium is a sizable apparatus.;
For reasons unbeknownst to us, they are most often found shattered into numerous pieces.;
Five, to be exact.${prompt};
Assemble a full astrarium and deliver it to us, and we shall reward you with other artifacts we have recovered--equally rare, but far more practical to one of your profession.;
Needless to say, the exchange would be to our mutual benefit.${prompt};
Ya know, for a private, you're doin' your fair share of work.${prompt};
Good to see.;
Don't be afrrraid to give it your all!${prompt};
Ya see...${wait-36: 2};
Your efforts have a direct effect on my little company's prrrofit.${prompt};
It rrreally does bring a tear to my eye to see you mercenaries sloggin' through the mud for Salaheem's Sentinels...${prompt};
But I can't help feelin' a bit jumpy lately.${prompt};
There's this guy makin' some mention of “darkness” approachin'.${prompt};
He suggested I make myself a charm to warrrd off the comin' evil...${prompt};
It's...it's not like I'm scared or anything. But us mercenaries have gotta be prrrepared, you know?${prompt};
Anyway, he says I need to use somethin' like ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to get the rrright amount of “protection.”${prompt};
But I'm so busy keepin' track of you lot and your activities that I've only been able to collect ${number: 1}.${prompt};
${name-player}, I want ya to brrring me the last ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
If ya do this for me, you might see a sudden jump in your mercenary rrrank.${prompt};
Whaddaya mean, what do I mean?;
Didn't I explain to ya about mercenary rrranks?${prompt};
Well, that's what we have Abquhbah for.${prompt};
Abquhbah!;
Prepare to rrrecite articles 1, 2, and 3 from the Mercenary Assessment Guidelines!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!;
Article 1!${prompt};
Follow President Naja's orders without question!${prompt};
Article 2!${prompt};
Fulfill President Naja's requests without fail!${prompt};
Article 3!${prompt};
Run President Naja's errands without complaint!${prompt};
<Pant>...<cough>...;
...That is all!${prompt};
Do ya get the drrrift?${prompt};
Do ya get it?;
${selection-lines};
I got it.;
...${prompt};
Hellooo!;
Is anybody home!${prompt};
Do I have to beat ya over the head with my spiky “friend” here until ya get it?${prompt};
Basically, mercenaries who do what they're told will find themselves climbin' the ladder faster'n those who ask stupid questions.${prompt};
Are ya still here!?${prompt};
I need to have ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to make my charm against the darkness.${prompt};
I only need ${number: 1} more!;
Get on it, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Oho, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!;
You didn't waste any time, now, did ya!${prompt};
Now I can get my charm made!${prompt};
What? Why are ya lookin' at me like that?${prompt};
The only thing in this world I believe in is money.;
It's the stuff from the “other” world that gives me the crrreeps...${prompt};
Brrr.;
Gives me the chills just thinkin' about it.${prompt};
N-now, you just listen.;
This is what they c-call the “mercenary shakes.”${prompt};
Rrright.;
You've done your job, so I s'pose I'll bump ya up to Private First Class.${prompt};
Now that you're Private First Class, ya better act like it!;
I wanna see those commissions rollin' in!${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Private First Class!${prompt};
Heh heh, you're doing prrretty well.${prompt};
Looks like some of that mercenary spirit is starting to sink in!${prompt};
Then again, it's usually times like these when people start slacking off and scrrrewing everything up.${prompt};
I've got a job that's just perrrfect for you.${prompt};
Get your gear rrready and get out there!${prompt};
...${prompt};
...?${prompt};
Whaddaya mean, “What am I s'posed to do?”${prompt};
I must be losin' my mind!${prompt};
You know what it is...?${prompt};
All that worryin' about the “Dark Rider”--it's messin' with my routine!${prompt};
So much for this piece of junk!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Naja Salaheem throws away her charm!;
Heh heh...${prompt};
Now, where was I?;
Oh yeah, have ya ever heard about the “Dark Rider”?${prompt};
Heard of the Dark Rider?;
${selection-lines};
Hasn't everyone?;
The Dark what?${prompt};
Is that rrright?;
I don't believe that a Private First Class like yourself would know much at all.;
I better explain.${prompt};
No idea, huh?;
Well, I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a lowly Private First Class.;
I better explain.${prompt};
The Dark Rider is a fearful knight that's part of a legend arrround here.${prompt};
They say the underworld is his battleground, where he fights for all eternity...${prompt};
The rrrumor goin' round is that this knight from the legend is s'posed to show up somewhere in the Empire.${prompt};
I mean, I didn't believe a word of it at first.${prompt};
But the tales coming out of the marketplace are too many to ignore...;
They say he rrrides a warhorse bigger'n a marid...${prompt};
And he obliterated a group of Mamool Ja with a single flash of his spear...${prompt};
The Empire can't ignore the sheer number of witnesses anymore, and has been on my back to send someone out to investigate.${prompt};
Course, I know they just don't wanna waste their prrrecious Immortals on a job that might turn out to be a fairy tale...${prompt};
In any case, I want ya to go out there and find some evidence that this Dark Rider rrreally exists.${prompt};
You get your hands on some decent prrroof, and I bet the Empire'll be willin' to rrreward ya for it.;
Ya got your orders!${prompt};
Back already?;
Did ya find anythin' to prove the Dark Rider is on our doorstep?${prompt};
Find any proof?;
${selection-lines};
I found something.;
Not yet.;
He found me...${prompt};
Grrreat work!${prompt};
Now, let's take a look at this evidence of yours.${prompt};
...${prompt};
${name-player}, ya do rrremember I told ya to bring back some proof, don't ya?${prompt};
Do you remember?;
${selection-lines};
I remember...;
Ah, no...${prompt};
Sorry? Couldn't hear ya.;
What was your answer?${prompt};
If we can turn up some hard evidence that the Dark Rider is lurkin' about, the Empire should be “verrry grateful,” if ya get my meaning.${prompt};
Stop playin' at bein' a mercenary, and be one!;
Get back out there!${prompt};
Keep your wits about ya!;
Let's collect that rrreward!${prompt};
${name-player}, I told ya to bring back proof, not dance with the blackheart himself!${prompt};
Unbelievable...${wait-36: 2};
Didn't I tell ya to keep on your toes!?${prompt};
Speak up!;
Ya say ya found ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Let's take a look.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Naja eyeballs the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Hmph.;
So this is your “proof”?${prompt};
Ya couldn't find anything a little more...exciting?${prompt};
Are ya sure someone didn't just make themselves a big wooden hoof and press it in the mud?${prompt};
Well...I s'pose I'll hang on to it.${prompt};
Now about that promotion.;
Since you've more or less carried out my instrrructions, I'll make an exception.;
This time.${prompt};
${name-player}, Private First Class!;
Welcome to the rank of Superior Private.${prompt};
Stand prrroud, soldier!;
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Superior Private!${prompt};
Come one, come all!;
There's room for everyone--no pushing, now!${prompt};
Witness the amazing antics of the singing, dancing Petrino! Cute, isn't she?${prompt};
Lalalalula～♪ Petrino loooves♪;
singing very muuuch♪ Lululalulala～♪${prompt};
Tatatataaa♪;
Petrino loooves♪ dancing even mooore♪;
Tetetetutaaa♪${prompt};
You've never seen anything like it!;
Come one, come all! Feast your eyes on the amazing Petrino!${prompt};
What a cute little puppet.;
She reminds me of my daughter when she was but a girl.${prompt};
I want an automaton of my own, but I know I'll never be able to afford one, so I watch Petrino every day instead! Ahhh! I wish I had one, too!${prompt};
Watching the charming antics of this performer makes it seem hard to believe that beastmen could invade at any time... It's nice to be able to forget about this town's strife, even if for but a moment.${prompt};
Grandpa, how does that puppet move?;
It's like a living creature!${prompt};
Heh heh... Well, you see...${prompt};
...That's a very good question.${prompt};
Eh? You wanna know why these docks're called “Ephramad Port”? You really don't know?${prompt};
Y'see, long ago, this city was the capital of a different nation. But Aht Urhgan, she kept expanding until she swallowed up all the countries around 'er.${prompt};
The name Ephramad Port's a remnant from the time before this land belonged t' Aht Urhgan. Least, that's what my dad tells me.${prompt};
I don't know of any sea other than the Cyan Deep, but even if there are other oceans on Urhguum, the fact still stands that the Cyan Deep is the best of them all!${prompt};
Why? Because the Cyan Deep is the only sea that was graced with the presence of the corsairs! Do you know of the corsairs?${prompt};
The corsairs were a group of pirates who operated with a commission from the Kingdom of Ephramad.${prompt};
The corsairs were excellent sailors, quite literally appearing out of the blue and taking a chunk out of the Imperial fleet before disappearing once again under the cover of the stormy sea.${prompt};
At the time, the Imperial fleet was said to be invincible...but even so, they were no match for the corsairs.${prompt};
But both Ephramad and the corsairs were destroyed long ago, leaving nothing but their name in the annals of time...${prompt};
The Seagull Phratrie are attempting to revive the glory of Ephramad, but I think they could have chosen a better way to do it...${prompt};
Not that I have any brilliant ideas myself...${prompt};
May you find in our sanctuary the answers to all existence on Urhguum...${prompt};
Here you may gaze upon the “Gordeus,” the very embodiment of Sage Walahra's philosophies.${prompt};
Sage Walahra was the founder of the philosophy “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”;
Without a full understanding of those words, one shall never approach the fundamental truth of existence.${prompt};
We spend our days reciting the words of Sage Walahra in an attempt to discover the true meaning behind the philosophy.${prompt};
Nonoroon carry cargo, you see? Heeeavy cargo, laaarge cargo, every day... No rest for Nonoroon!${prompt};
Nonoroon came to Al Zahbi Port and the peoples gave Nonoroon work, you see? Everyone so niiice. Nonoroon like to thaaank everyone!${prompt};
But so maaany ships. Every day, mooore work. Nonoroon aaalways busy!${prompt};
Quite some time ago, there was an absolutely horrifying epidemic in Bastok, one of the nations of the Middle Lands. It was referred to as the “Bastokan Blight.”${prompt};
The other alchemists say that one of our very own traveled to Bastok and developed a cure for the illness.${prompt};
Hearing that makes me proud, but in all practicality, the remedy may have been discovered by mere accident. I mean, the cause of the epidemic is still unknown...${prompt};
Someone really should lead an investigation into the reasons for the Bastokan Blight. I am thinking of taking it up as my life's work.${prompt};
You may wonder why I would pour such effort into researching a disease that no longer exists, but all I can tell you in response is that alchemists are highly inquisitive creatures.${prompt};
Grrr, that girl really makes the furrr on my tail stand on end! I can't believe I came all this way to be a mercenary in her rrridiculous company!${prompt};
I'm gonna quit! I'm rrreally gonna quit!${prompt};
You wouldn't happen to want to hear a juicy secrrret about Naja Salaheem, would you? Well?${prompt};
Ask her about Naja's secret?;
${selection-lines};
Fill me in!;
How childish...${prompt};
Naja's famous for her money-grrrubbing tendencies. They say she refused to go in debt, even a single bronze piece, when founding Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Everrryone's whispering about how she managed to raise so much capital at such a young age...${prompt};
Personally, I think there's something to that giant club she carries arrround with her, but there's got to be more to it than that...${prompt};
Are you surrre? Fine. Your loss.${prompt};
How am I going to enter the workshop without looking suspicious? I can't just waltz in... Maybe I could pretend to be a customer? Hmmm...how about an apprentice?${prompt};
They say that the automaton is the apex of Near Eastern technology. I can't go back until I learn the secrets of their production...${prompt};
The members of my guild back home will know instantly if I'm lying...${prompt};
Cardians and puppets...;
Automatons and Cardians...${prompt};
Mobility, mass production, endurance, widespread use, safety, reliability, thermal power, cognition, practicality, beauty, eloquence, charm...and even that's not the last of their similarities!${prompt};
But how are they different?;
And which is better? They won't let me go home until I know the answer!${prompt};
Oh, a traveler! Perfect... You can listen to my worries!${prompt};
Actually, I just have one complaint.;
I can't sing my love songs freely in this nation!${prompt};
All the fault lies with the Immortals!;
They ask around town for anyone who may be trying to “taint the minds of the public” or “create dissension against the Empress.” In reality, they are keeping a close watch on all of us.${prompt};
The other day, I sang a fictional love song about a princess and a prince, and I was nearly carted off to the dungeons!${prompt};
But I could do no good for this poor nation if I simply went west. I am worrying myself into knots just thinking about it all...${prompt};
I wonder what will happen when the Gordeus is finally unraveled and we learn the mysteries of Urhguum... What do you think?${prompt};
This is what the legends say...${prompt};
“The truth will be unraveled when the two masses meet...${prompt};
“Their collision will give birth to a violent storm.;
The storm will rise towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.”;
Well? What do you make of it?${prompt};
Howdy-dowdy!;
Have you figured out this town's ward system yet?${prompt};
Are you an expert on wards?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I know everything.;
No, can you explain?${prompt};
Well, that's one fewer worry-dorry you'll have to deal with!;
Off on your way-day, now! You don't want the Immortals to set their sights on you!${prompt};
No problem-doblem!;
What would you like to know?${prompt};
Ask about which ward?;
${selection-lines};
Commoners' Ward.;
Merchants' Ward.;
Imperial Ward.${prompt};
Those who have been stripped-dipped of their citizenship and those who never had it in the first place live in the Commoners' Ward. It's a relatively new area.${prompt};
People who have come from other nations and the merchants who sell to them live in the Merchants' Ward. It's a smorgasbord of sights and smells. There are also two ports that allow Aht Urhgan Whitegate to serve as the main “gate” to West Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
The Imperial Ward lies beyond those towering ivory walls. It houses the Imperial palace, facilities for the Imperial Army, and the residences of the Imperial family. People like us aren't even allowed to enter.${prompt};
In ancient times, there existed an advanced civilization called the “Empire of Alzadaal.”${prompt};
Emperor Alzadaal had the power to control an enormous humanoid that he used to conquer the surrounding nations. Utilizing this mysterious power, he built the foundation of an enormous empire.${prompt};
Every child in Aht Urhgan knows that fairy tale. Did you?${prompt};
Hey, listen up! I saw something absolutely unberry-lievable! It was a Yagudo. Yes, a Yagudo! Do you know what I'm talking about? A Yagudo in town, of all places!${prompt};
Not only that, but he was sipper-sipping a cup of chai at the teahouse! Can you believe that? That kind of thing would never, ever happen in Windurst!${prompt};
I mean, that's like talky-walking into the Rarab Tail Hostelry one day and...boom! There's a Yagudo sitting in the corner eating his lunch with a little napkin on his lap! I mean, this is a Yagudo we're talking about here!${prompt};
My friends in Windurst are never gonna believe me when I tell them...${prompt};
If you stick around in this town long enough, I'm sure you'll see him yourself...a Yagudo tea aficionado! Now I've seen everything!${prompt};
You will never guess what I saw! He was right in front of me...the dreamiest man I had ever laid eyes on!${prompt};
Can you imagine my surprise? He was covered from head to toe in golden armor. He was so stunning I was forced to shade my eyes!${prompt};
Not only that, but he was so generous! He treated everyone in the teahouse to all the chai and coffee we could drink! Have you ever heard anything like it? <Sigh>...${prompt};
Teteroon at yooor service!;
Teteroon is meeercenary.${prompt};
Three cheers fooor the Empreeess!;
...Just little joooke. Ha ha!${prompt};
You appear to be an adventurer.;
Are you aware that there is a place called the “Chamber of Passage” in this town?${prompt};
Apparently, it allows you to be instantly transported to an area that you have previously visited...of all things!${prompt};
Then again, I wonder how much truth there is in such tales.;
After all, people also insist that there are ships that can fly in the sky!${prompt};
They say this auction house is connected with another auction house located in the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.${prompt};
There are rumors that some dubious folk called the “Tenshodo” are somehow behind it all.${prompt};
An amazing variety of wares are sold daily in Jeuno's auction house. It's huge business!${prompt};
Thanks to the Tenshodo, my goods are selling faster than ever before!${prompt};
There are two types of drinks here at the Shararat Teahouse--coffee and chai.;
The coffee appeals to the traditionalists and allows the shop to retain its atmosphere...${prompt};
But they made a wise decision by also introducing chai, which is newer and cheaper than coffee. Now, this teahouse is extremely popular with young people, and is always bustling with activity. A brilliant business move, don't you think?${prompt};
I just can't decide whether I identify more with the coffee crowd or the chai crowd!${prompt};
My mom told me that rich people live on the other side of that wall...${prompt};
She said we can't go over there because we're poor. Why can't we be rich, too?${prompt};
Did you know that coffee will make you feel really nice if you just pour a bag of maple sugar into it? Even I can drink it, then!${prompt};
And guess what else?;
Lately everyone drinks it with Selbina milk! If you pour a bottle or so in, I heard it tastes pretty mild and is easy to drink.${prompt};
But I still like juice much better. The color is so pretty!${prompt};
Hey, you ever been there?${prompt};
Have you?;
${selection-lines};
A million times!;
Been where?${prompt};
Heheheh, of course you have!;
I can tell by the looks of ya!${prompt};
Where? Where else?;
Kokba Hostel, of course!${prompt};
Kokba Hostel is no ordinary hostel!;
The moment you enter, they provide you with food and items! And just wait until you see the attendants! ...Know what I'm saying?${prompt};
Don't tell anybody, but sometimes when I come to Al Zahbi...I even go there alone. My mother would die if she knew...${prompt};
You have arrived at Victory Gate.;
Beyond lies the Commoners' Ward.${prompt};
This is Imperial Whitegate.;
Beyond lies the Imperial Ward. Noncitizens of the Empire are denied entry.${prompt};
We volunteer soldiers are not to be confused with the mercenaries and the Imperial soldiers, who fight only for their own gain.${prompt};
Unlike them, we volunteered to protect the town we live in and love.${prompt};
Falzum...${prompt};
Your mercenary evaluation is falling behind every other employee.${prompt};
It is...?${prompt};
If this trend continues, I'll be forced to give a less-than-glowing report.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You two joined our company at around the same time.${prompt};
${name-player} is already a Superior Private, but you...${prompt};
I really don't want to have to file this report...${prompt};
B-but...;
I...${prompt};
I don't think I can improve my evaluation all by myself...${prompt};
And that spiky mace that President Naja carries makes me nervous...${prompt};
My heart skips a beat every time she pounds on her desk...${prompt};
President Naja just has to look at me these days and...${prompt};
...I...${prompt};
...I start shaking in terror...${prompt};
I can't even bring myself to turn that corner.${prompt};
I see...;
(How in the world did this guy become a mercenary...?)${prompt};
But, Falzum...${prompt};
Do you remember how the mercenary evaluation works?${prompt};
I remember...${prompt};
Then you should know that you have to carry out any task President Naja asks of you.${prompt};
If you don't...${prompt};
I know!;
Boy, do I know...${prompt};
I just need a little more time...${prompt};
Are you going to be okay?${prompt};
I don't know.;
For the moment, I'll try to gather the water.${prompt};
That should be something that even I can do...${prompt};
(Should be...)${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Well, at least he's trying something.;
That's good news.${prompt};
Hm?;
What's wrong with him?${prompt};
Well, you see...${prompt};
President Naja, how is the crystal compass working for you?${prompt};
It's wonderful!${prompt};
With this little device...${prompt};
...I can keep track of my pawns no matter where they are!${prompt};
All by pressing one simple switch.${prompt};
You Imperial alchemists rrreally know your stuff.${prompt};
You flatter me, President Naja.${prompt};
Actually, it is on the matter of the crystal compass that I came to speak with you.${prompt};
The number of mercenaries affiliated with Salaheem's Sentinels continues to grow.${prompt};
And the truth is, we are unable to keep up with the production of the quartz transmitters used in your company badges...${prompt};
The transmitter is responsible for sending the exact coordinates of the target to the crystal compass.${prompt};
However, our supply of the mythralline liquid used to create these transmitters is running dangerously low.${prompt};
In order to produce more of the liquid, we require water from the Mythralline Wellsprings.${prompt};
Would it be possible to enlist the services of one of your mercenaries?${prompt};
I require some assistance in collecting the liquid.${prompt};
Falzum!${prompt};
Y-yes?${prompt};
I can't hear you!${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
Your evaluations are abysmal. There's no denyin' it.${prompt};
I'm throwin' you a lifeline!${prompt};
Your beloved president has work for you!${prompt};
And you better smile and take it!${prompt};
I, I...${prompt};
Read that note and scurry on over to the Alchemists' Guild!${prompt};
Yes, ma'am...${prompt};
If ya can't complete even this simple task...${prompt};
You know what's comin'!${prompt};
What was written in the note, you ask?${prompt};
It was some sort of complicated formula...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm a little worried.${prompt};
Aren't you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
This will have to be kept absolutely, positively secret from President Naja, but...${prompt};
Would you mind giving Falzum a bit of a hand?${prompt};
Help out Falzum?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, why not?;
He got himself into this...${prompt};
Great!;
I knew I could count on you!${prompt};
If you hurry, you should be able to catch him!${prompt};
Knowing Falzum, he's probably still fumbling around at the Alchemists' Guild...${prompt};
I know he's a little hopeless, but you must feel some sympathy for your fellow mercenary.${prompt};
After all, you have a responsibility as his superior!${prompt};
Quickly, you can still catch him!${prompt};
Knowing Falzum, he's probably still fumbling around at the Alchemists' Guild...${prompt};
Another employee from Salaheem's Sentinels?${prompt};
You're a Salaheem's Sentinels employee?;
${selection-lines};
That's right.;
Another employee...?${prompt};
Those Wildcat badges really are quite distinctive.;
Three carps on bronze...${prompt};
That would make you a Superior Private, yes?${prompt};
I heard from another mercenary about the ranks within Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
I am considered an initiate of the Alchemists' Guild. The mysteries of the world have barely begun to open up to me...${prompt};
Some time in the not-too-distant future, I hope to focus on a research field of my own choosing and produce some solid results.${prompt};
Oh, I just assumed...${prompt};
You see, I was just recently introduced to a young, blonde mercenary called Falzum who is going to help me create a batch of mythralline liquid.${prompt};
From what Falzum tells me, it seems he's still only a Private Second Class...${prompt};
I felt uneasy about sending him off into the wilds, so I just have him doing a few light chores at the moment.${prompt};
Come to think of it, he's been gone for quite a while now...${prompt};
Miss Nafiwaa!;
I'm back!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Falzum proudly holds up a bottle of water!;
I brought the water from the Serpentking Square fountain, just liked you asked me!${prompt};
That's...that's wonderful.;
And it hardly took you any time at all...${prompt};
Hehehe. I can move pretty fast when I want to.${prompt};
Oh. Hello, ${name-player}.;
What are you doing here?${prompt};
You know each other?${prompt};
That's right. We joined up at about the same time.${prompt};
Of course, ${name-player} is far more...${prompt};
I mean...ah...never mind.;
Forget I said anything...${prompt};
...${prompt};
So...what brings you to the Alchemists' Guild, ${name-player}?${prompt};
What brings you here?;
${selection-lines};
The study of alchemy.;
The guild shop.;
New alchemy recipes.;
Helping you, Falzum.${prompt};
Wow, you're interested in alchemy?${prompt};
I joined the Alchemists' Guild as well, but I'm still only an amateur...${prompt};
I sometimes come here to buy materials to work on my alchemy skills...;
Someday I'll use all the stuff that's cluttering up my Mog House...${prompt};
Aren't the recipes fascinating?;
I'm going to try one of them once I figure out what I'm supposed to do...${prompt};
Help me!?${prompt};
You're going to help me gather the mythralline liquid?${prompt};
But...but this task was given to me for my mercenary evaluation...${prompt};
I-I have to complete it a-alone!${prompt};
I mean, President Naja said this was my last chance...${prompt};
Are you sure President Naja mentioned anything about working alone?${prompt};
Yes, I'm sure. Kind of...${prompt};
Kind of?;
I don't see anything wrong with having a little help.${prompt};
But...I...${prompt};
Maybe you should take advantage of ${name-player}'s kind offer.${prompt};
Ummm...;
I wonder if Abquhbah knows about this...${prompt};
Does Abquhbah know?;
${selection-lines};
He knows.;
He knows nothing.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Oh...${prompt};
Okay, then.;
I guess I'll accept your assistance, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Wonderful.;
Allow me to explain the process for creating the mythralline liquid.${prompt};
Have you heard about the unusual bodies of water found in the areas neighboring Al Zahbi?${prompt};
There are four places in the Wajaom Woodlands and one in Bhaflau Thickets where you can find pools of strangely colored water. I'm sure you will recognize them almost immediately.${prompt};
The reason for the unusual color is the high concentration of mythralline dissolved in the water--it has a diffusive reflection effect.${prompt};
This characteristic has led us to collectively call these pools the “Mythralline Wellsprings.”${prompt};
Please take these five test tubes.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}You receive five test tubes from Nafiwaa.;
The water you collect from each of the springs will be used in the first stage of mythralline liquid creation.${prompt};
Please be sure to collect a sample from each of the five springs--they all differ slightly in composition.${prompt};
Stay aware of your surroundings.;
There is no end to reports of beastman activity in the area...${prompt};
Th-thank you for your help, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now...while ${name-player} is off doing that, you can start learning about the process used to create the mythralline liquid.${prompt};
If you are, in fact, a member of the Alchemists' Guild, this is a good time to begin your training.;
Don't you agree?${prompt};
S-sure...${prompt};
${name-player}.;
I would like you to use the test tubes I gave you to collect water from the Mythralline Wellsprings.${prompt};
There are five locations: four in the Wajaom Woodlands, and one in Bhaflau Thickets.${prompt};
The waters of each spring differ slightly in composition, so please make sure you collect samples from all five locations.${prompt};
I see you have collected ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[sample/samples] of water.${prompt};
Please help Falzum through this, ${name-player}.;
If he doesn't improve his assessment...${prompt};
I'm afraid I'll have to give him a scathing report...;
(It ties my stomach in knots just thinking about it.)${prompt};
Excellent! You have all five samples of water.${prompt};
Now we have everything we need to get started.${prompt};
Where is...?${prompt};
Ah, there he is...;
Falzum!${prompt};
Coming!${prompt};
The preparations for the mythralline liquid are complete.;
It's time to begin the next stage.${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
While you were collecting the water, Falzum has been studying up on the process for creating the liquid.${prompt};
Show ${name-player} what you've learned.${prompt};
Okay. I'm still not one hundred percent certain, but I'll do my best.${prompt};
Uhum. Let us begin the creation of the mythralline liquid.${prompt};
First, we must test the mythralline concentration of each sample of water.${prompt};
Knowing the concentration of mythralline is paramount to the success of this process.${prompt};
Even a slight variation in density could affect the final outcome.${prompt};
I will now proceed to test the density of the spring water using this alchemical paper.${prompt};
The higher the density of mythralline, the faster the color of the paper will change.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Falzum dips a strip of paper into each of the water samples.;
Which sample do you want to look at, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Which sample do you look at?;
${selection-lines};
Start the process.${prompt};
The concentration of mythralline in ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} appears to be very light.;
The alchemical paper hasn't changed a bit.${prompt};
I'd stake my reputation as an alchemist on it. Hehe.${prompt};
The concentration of mythralline in ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} appears to be very dense.;
Look how much the color of the alchemical paper has changed!${prompt};
The water in ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} caused a reaction three times faster than the sample in ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
I would say the water in ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has a density equal to half that of the sample with the highest concentration of mythralline.${prompt};
Okay.;D'accord.
Each time, I'm going to take a third of a water sample and pour it into this beaker.${prompt};
S-so...;
Here goes...${prompt};
Which sample shall we put into the beaker?${prompt};
Which sample do you want to put into the beaker next?${prompt};
Which sample do you mix in?;
${selection-lines};
What were the densities again?;
Complete the process!${prompt};
I've poured a third of the water from ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into the beaker.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is now two-thirds full.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is now one-third full.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is now empty...${prompt};
You want to know the densities again?;
Okay, listen closely...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}A reaction is occurring inside the beaker!;
The blended water is shining like silver.;
Ooh...${prompt};
The blended water is shining like mythril.;
Wow...${prompt};
The blended water is shining like gold.;
How pretty...${prompt};
The blended water is shining like platinum.;
It's beautiful...${prompt};
The blended water is shining like luminium!;
It's amazing!${prompt};
Why is there smoke...?;
${name-player}! Help!${prompt};
Are we done?${prompt};
Complete the process?;
${selection-lines};
We're done.;
Not yet.${prompt};Pas encore.${prompt}
Is it okay if I hand over the blended water to the guild now?;
I hope this is the mythralline liquid they wanted...${prompt};
Is it okay?;
${selection-lines};
Go ahead.;
Maybe not...${prompt};
Great!;
Miss Nafiwaa, here is the mythralline liquid we made.;
I hope it's okay...${prompt};
Thank you, Falzum.;
I'll have to let it sit overnight before I can test the liquid.${prompt};
I'll contact Salaheem's Sentinels on your behalf once I have the results.${prompt};
Now we can only pray for a high-quality yield...${prompt};
Thank you so much, both of you.${prompt};
I'm glad everything worked out, Falzum.${prompt};
Really...?;
Then I guess we'll just have to pour this one down the drain...${prompt};
Dispose of the beaker's contents?;
${selection-lines};
It's a shame, but...;
Wait!${prompt};
Oh well, back to square one.${prompt};
I will contact Salaheem's Sentinels with the mythralline liquid results.;
I hope we have a high-quality yield...${prompt};
Results from the Alchemists' Guild?;
Sorry, I haven't heard anything yet.${prompt};
You've helped Falzum finish his task already?${prompt};
I suppose that leaves President Naja's evaluation...;
(Ugh...my stomach...the butterflies...)${prompt};
Hello, ${name-player}.;
Falzum is still studying the process for creating mythralline liquid.${prompt};
Do you wish to attempt to create a batch with the water you have now?${prompt};
Attempt the process?;
${selection-lines};
Let's do it.;
Not just now.${prompt};
Very well.;
Before you begin, would you like to check the contents of your test tubes?${prompt};
Which test tube do you check?;
${selection-lines};
Begin the process!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is ${choice: 1}[full/two-thirds full/one-third full].${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is empty.${prompt};
Quickly, ${name-player}!;
President Naja is waiting for you!${prompt};
Falzum is back there as well...${prompt};
I-I swear I didn't say a word about your involvement!${prompt};
You better get in there.;
I think Falzum is about to faint...${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...;
(I wonder how she found out...?)${prompt};
Where have ya been, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Hm?;
Why was I waitin' for your ugly mug to show up?${prompt};
As if ya didn't know!${prompt};
Did ya actually think there was even a second when I didn't know what my little pawns were up to?${prompt};
Hmph.;
I'll get back to you, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Falzum!${prompt};
Gah!${prompt};
I'll get the truth outta you.${prompt};
Do ya rrrealize what kinda hole you've dug yourself into?${prompt};
How long are ya gonna stand there like a silent pile o' puk brains!?${prompt};
You're rrreally startin' to test my patience!${prompt};
Gaaahhh!${prompt};
Your pathetic blubberin' isn't gonna soften my heart one bit.;
Now speak!${prompt};
<Sob...sniffle>...${prompt};
I-I-I...!${prompt};
${name-player} here...${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] h-helped me with my w-work at the Alchemists' Guild...${prompt};
Is that rrright?${prompt};
So...${prompt};
Ya just completely took advantage of my sympathy!?${prompt};
I...${prompt};
Ya think you can take a task I created specifically to help ya out and just hand it off to another mercenary!?${prompt};
(I'm sorry...)${prompt};
I can't hear ya.${prompt};
I...${prompt};
I'm terribly terribly sorry!${prompt};
Ya admit your guilt in this?${prompt};
Y-yes...${prompt};
And you're willin' to make up for it?${prompt};
I...that is...yes!${prompt};
Well, I'm glad to know where we stand.${prompt};
Now that we have Falzum's side of the story, let's hear what ${name-player} has to say.${prompt};
I prrromise I won't get mad.;
Tell me ya honest opinion of what it means to be a mercenary.${prompt};
What is a mercenary's duty?;
${selection-lines};
Um...;
Helping ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fellow mercenaries.;
Completing ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] set tasks.${prompt};
Amazing!${prompt};
Ya actually gave the rrright answer!${prompt};
It's about time ya started to figure things out.${prompt};
If I don't have someone to help train the green rrrecruits, this company's gonna fall to pieces.${prompt};
I'll be countin' on your support in the future, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Hey!;
Are you gonna sit there all day!?${prompt};
Wha-?;
No, ma'am!${prompt};
You'd do well to learn a thing or two from ${name-player}.${prompt};
That's all I needed ya to hear.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am...${prompt};
Judgin' by the rrreward from the guild, it seems ya might have a talent for alchemy.${prompt};
Nothin' like the warm, fuzzy feelin' you get from a big payoff.${prompt};
Give ${name-player} here ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] rrreward from the Alchemists' Guild, minus our usual cut.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
Mercenary administration is your job, rrremember?${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!;
(She remembered my position...?)${prompt};
Superior Private ${name-player}.${prompt};
You're about to assume a position of authorrrity.${prompt};
As a Lance Corporal, you'll be rrrequired to give one hundred and twenty percent for this company.${prompt};
Let me down and your next meeting will be with the head of my morningstar.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Lance Corporal!;
Keep spoutin' the bloody obvious and you'll stay a Superior Private forever.${prompt};
I expect every one of my employees to carry out their duties as a mercenary.;
Don't think ya can pacify me with the company line.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}.;
Too bad I'm busy right now.${prompt};
Can ya come back later?${prompt};
Well? Stop just standin' there and get back to work!${prompt};
...Hold it!${prompt};
${name-player}...;
Hmmm...${prompt};
Ah well, I might as well ask ya.${prompt};
Just let me finish skimming over this little note from the Imperial Army...${prompt};
Hmmm...interesting.${prompt};
It's about time those muscleheads started listening to Naja here!${prompt};
Heh heh heh... This news's got me purrring like a kitten.♪${prompt};
What're you lookin' at? Do I need a rrreason to be happy?${prompt};
Guess I might as well tell ya... Rrremember the “Dark Rider”?${prompt};
Remember the Dark Rider?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
Wasn't that some kind of comic book?${prompt};
Now that's what I wanna hear. Ya mercenaries'd be nothin' without experrrience.${prompt};
Experience is what gives ya the wits to be able to stay outta the jaws of death.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Do you ever listen to what people tell ya?${prompt};
Since I'm in a good mood, I'll explain once more, so clean your ears out and listen close!${prompt};
The Dark Rider is a fearful knight that's spoken of in legends 'rrround here. They say the underworld is his battleground, where he fights for all eternity.${prompt};
There even used to be nations that revered him as a god of war.${prompt};
Anyway, this notice here is about that Dark Rider.${prompt};
And here's what it says...${prompt};
“The Imperial Army has thoroughly examined the details regarding the reported hoofprint and confirmed Naja Salaheem's information to be correct. The Empire hereby officially acknowledges the existence of the Dark Rider.”${prompt};
Soon everyone in Al Zahbi will know that I, Naja Salaheem, was right!${prompt};
The Imperial Army'll be forced to announce the imminent threat on our horizon!${prompt};
They'rrre all in a huff about this.${prompt};
And my mercenaries have kept their contract...${prompt};
Through rain and through wind!${prompt};
In sickness and in health!${prompt};
This is all thanks to you busting your guts to find out about that Dark Rider!${prompt};
I can see the fruits of your efforts rrright here in my paws... A fine contribution to the development of our little company.${prompt};
Still, that Dark Rider could pop up anytime, anywhere. It's gotta be creating a headache for the Imperial Army.${prompt};
They've tried sprrreading out to search for him, tried routing him, even set up a trap--but apparently he's been slipping away no matter what they do.${prompt};
You know what that means!${prompt};
Now it's our turn to show everyone what we've got.${prompt};
We can't let this Dark Knight rrrun free and threaten our Empire!${prompt};
Still, it's a waste of time and resources sending a whole army runnin' off on a single person's trail.${prompt};
That's where my merrrcenaries come in. I can move my people about freely, and nobody beats us at gathering information.${prompt};
But of course, the most valuable source of information is the Dark Rider himself...${prompt};
So let's get to work!${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} obtains ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
Go put that wherever you find a Dark Rider hoofprint!${prompt};
The Dark Rider has been most frequently sighted in the Wajaom Woodlands, the Bhaflau Thickets, Mount Zhayolm, and Caedarva Mire.${prompt};
You should be able to find a hoofprint in one of those areas.${prompt};
Am I making myself clear? The point of this mission is to place a bell on the Dark Rider. Got it now?${prompt};
So ya wanna know what the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is for, do ya?${prompt};
You ask too many questions, kid. Curiosity killed the cat, rrright?${prompt};
This mission is a golden opportunity to rrraise this company's prestige, so don't let it get away.${prompt};
Not to mention that it's also a great way to show your dedication to your beloved employer. Couldn't ask for more, could ya?${prompt};
The Dark Rider has been most frequently sighted in the Wajaom Woodlands, the Bhaflau Thickets, Mount Zhayolm, and Caedarva Mire.${prompt};
You should be able to find a hoofprint in one of those areas.${prompt};
Now go put that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} wherever you find a Dark Rider hoofprint!${prompt};
Well, well, well...;
It looks like you've managed to pull off another job.${prompt};
I've been waitin' for ya.${prompt};
If the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} just works properly, we're all done.${prompt};
Now time for my secrrret weapon.♪${prompt};
Beautiful, isn't she?${prompt};
This is called a “crystal compass.” It picks up a certain signal and displays its whereabouts on a map. It was a little gift from the Imperial Army...${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I gave to you gives off the signal that this compass reacts to.${prompt};
So ya wanna know why I didn't tell ya that in the first place, do ya?${prompt};
...Why the hell would you need to know, anyway?${prompt};
But seriously, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a rrreally valuable item.${prompt};
Not that I don't trrrust ya or anything, but if that thing ended up for sale at the auction house, Salaheem's Sentinels would become the laughingstock of Aht Urhgan!${prompt};
A-anyway... Let's just hit the switch now and see what this thing can do.${prompt};
Heh... I feel like a kid at a candy store...${prompt};
Yow!;
That looks like...${choice: 0}[/the Wajaom Woodlands/the Bhaflau Thickets/Mount Zhayolm/Caedarva Mire]!${prompt};
Perrrfect!${prompt};
It's picking up the signal from the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} that you set, just like it's supposed to. Grrreat work! Mission complete!${prompt};
Using this, we can study the Dark Rider's movements and use the information to prrredict where and when he's gonna show up next.${prompt};
The Imperial Army might even be able to catch him now, thanks to this!${prompt};
Nah...that's asking for way too much from those numbskulls.${prompt};
Still... Funny, isn't it? A big, bad knight from the underworld...and we can keep tabs on him using a simple device.${prompt};
Not much different from a rrregular monster, is it?${prompt};
And who knows? Maybe he just came here because he wanted a change of scenery...${prompt};
When you think about it that way, the Dark Rider isn't scarrry enough to frighten a kitten.${prompt};
You've drrriven the darkness right out of my heart, ${name-player}.♪${prompt};
I guess it's time...${prompt};
As a reward for successfully accomplishing this important mission and for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] special contributions to the president, I hereby promote ${name-player} to the position of Corporal!${prompt};
Congratulations!${prompt};
Congratulations, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]!${prompt};
Now you know we're never gonna let you go...${prompt};
I look forward to seeing even more death-defying feats from you now, Corporal ${name-player}.♪${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Corporal!;
The beaker can hold up to two full test tubes of water, so we can blend up to six thirds...I think.${prompt};
We can add ${number: 5} ${choice-plurality: 5}[more sample/more samples] to the beaker.${prompt};
Oh...oh dear...oh my...;
What should we do!?${prompt};
Take the smoking beaker and...;
${selection-lines};
...hand it to the guild!;
...throw it away.${prompt};
Oh.;
${name-player}, the beaker is full now.;
What should we do?${prompt};
Take the full beaker and...;
${selection-lines};
...hand it to the guild!;
...throw it away.${prompt};
Eh? You wanna know about the ghost ship!?;
You got a lotta guts t' bring that up in 'earing range of the palace...${prompt};
The Immortals are branding anyone what talks about that spook ship as a member of the Seagull Phratrie. Be careful you don't get yourself 'auled away in chains.${prompt};
But just between you an' me...;
I 'eard there's a bloke what saw a great shadow of a ship sailing through the mists of the Silver Sea. Says that 'e saw not one sailor on deck to guide 'er course...${prompt};
The other day I was almost dragged off to the dungeon merely for singing the tale of ghosts that trouble a town night after night.${prompt};
Hey, listen up! I saw something absolutely unberry-lievable!;
It was a ghost! Yes, a spooky-creepy specter!;
I saw it just outside town!${prompt};
It looked like it wanted to drifty-wift right through the gates and start spookifying people.;
Can you believe that?${prompt};
And it kept jumble-mumbling something about “eframard” and “revenge.” It must be one of those spiteful spirits bent on vengeance!${prompt};
Brrr!;
I wonder what “eframard” means...;
I'm kinda curious...but not curious enough to want to see that ghastly ghosty again!${prompt};
Maybe you'll meet it if you winder-wander outside!;
Spiteful spirits...brrr!${prompt};
You are an adventurer, are you not?;
If you are interested in becoming a mercenary, you should go to Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Salaheem's Sentinels is the only mercenary organization permitted by the Empire within its borders.;
You can find their headquarters at the southern port.${prompt};
Ah, a mercenary from Salaheem's Sentinels.;
Are you aware that the lands of Aradjiah are infested by vicious monsters as of late?${prompt};
I am currently gathering information to use in vanquishing this threat. I would highly appreciate your cooperation in this matter.${prompt};
If you opt to lend your assistance, I will require an investigation into the enemies' weaknesses. According to my research, all monsters possess two weak points.${prompt};
Based on the information you provide, a special force will be organized to confront the savage hordes. You must take pride in the job that I am entrusting to you.${prompt};
I will personally see to it that you do not go unrewarded for an accurate assessment. Will you contribute to our cause?${prompt};
Lend your assistance?;
${selection-lines};
Let me be of service!;
I'm not in the mood...${prompt};
You have my gratitude!;
I have decided to place my faith in you.;
Which variety of beastman would you like to investigate?${prompt};
Select a type of beastman.;
${selection-lines};
Lamia.;
Troll.;
Mamool Ja.${prompt};
You wish to study the Lamiae, do you? Then you must proceed to Caedarva Mire.${prompt};
According to my research, there are a number of Lamiae by the viridescent bogs in the area.${prompt};
You wish to study the Trolls, do you? Then you must proceed to Mount Zhayolm.${prompt};
According to my research, there are a number of Trolls along the eastern shores in the area.${prompt};
You wish to study the Mamool Ja, do you? Then you must proceed to the Wajaom Woodlands.${prompt};
According to my research, there are a number of Mamool Ja near the arch in the southwest of the area.${prompt};
Is that so?;
Well, you know where to come if you change your mind.${prompt};
Have you decided to help rid the Aradjiah continent of vile beastmen?${prompt};
Our investigations are not merely scholarly--our true purpose is to subdue the enemy. Remember that, and never give up the fight.${prompt};
Have you discovered the monsters' weaknesses yet? Let us take a look at what you have discovered.${prompt};
One of the weak points is...;

Every monster has two weaknesses. If my hypothesis is correct, there must be one more...${prompt};
According to your research, the Lamiae's weak points are ${choice: 0}[/a certain weapon skill/a weapon skill from a certain angle/a certain element/a certain sound/their low strength] and ${choice: 1}[/a certain weapon skill/a weapon skill from a certain angle/a certain element/a certain sound/their low strength]?${prompt};

Is that correct?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
No, wait...${prompt};
A special force will be organized based on this information to confront the beastman threat that looms over these lands.${prompt};
A special force is now being put together based on the information you have provided us. It is not long before we set out to decimate the enemy.${prompt};
They were just as you deduced! The information you provided us with was invaluable!${prompt};
The Lamiae were vulnerable ${choice: 4}[/to a certain weapon skill/to a weapon skill from a certain angle/to a certain element/to a certain sound/due to their low strength] as reported, but you were mistaken about them being weak ${choice: 5}[/to a certain weapon skill/to a weapon skill from a certain angle/to a certain element/to a certain sound/due to their low strength].${prompt};
You were mistaken about the Lamiae's vulnerability ${choice: 4}[/to a certain weapon skill/to a weapon skill from a certain angle/to a certain element/to a certain sound/due to their low strength], but your report was faithful in its description of ${choice: 5}[/their weakness to a certain weapon skill/their weakness to a weapon skill from a certain angle/their weakness to a certain element/their weakness to a certain sound/their low strength].${prompt};

Both of your deductions...${wait-36: 2};
...completely missed the mark.${prompt};
We owe our success on the battlefield to you. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt};
You are well on the path to becoming a ${choice: 1}[/Private First Class/Superior Private/Lance Corporal/Corporal/Sergeant/Sergeant Major/Chief Sergeant/Second Lieutenant/First Lieutenant/Captain]. I will report your success to Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
It was a pleasure working with you, Captain ${name-player}.;
I will report your success to Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Fortunately, we did not fare too poorly this time, but faulty information can be disastrous on the battlefield.${prompt};
It is natural to make mistakes when you are new, but you must be responsible for your work.${prompt};
A mercenary of your rank should be able to faithfully carry out even the most menial of tasks. You must learn to apply yourself more.${prompt};
You must handle your duties with more care. Inattentiveness breeds mistakes. Remember to concentrate.${prompt};
I do not expect you to be perfect, but you must properly fulfill your duties if you expect to become a first-class mercenary. You must work harder.${prompt};
Do not underestimate your duties because of your rank. Sometimes you can learn from the attitude of new recruits.${prompt};
I expect more from a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of your rank, ${choice: 1}[/Private Second Class/Private First Class/Superior Private/Lance Corporal/Corporal/Sergeant/Sergeant Major/Chief Sergeant/Second Lieutenant/First Lieutenant]. Do not disappoint me again.${prompt};
A small mistake, but a Captain should be beyond such simple error...${prompt};
Your Imperial Standing has increased!${prompt};
Our unit was decimated because of the false report you gave us! How do you expect to grow as a mercenary when you cannot even fulfill a simple task?${prompt};
I will inform Salaheem's Sentinels of your failure.;
You have much to learn before reaching the rank of ${choice: 1}[/Private First Class/Superior Private/Lance Corporal/Corporal/Sergeant/Sergeant Major/Chief Sergeant/Second Lieutenant/First Lieutenant/Captain].${prompt};
I will inform Salaheem's Sentinels of your failure.;
This level of negligence should be punishable by demotion!${prompt};
Would you like to investigate monster weaknesses again? We welcome information on the Lamiae, Trolls, and the Mamool Ja.${prompt};

The chai here always tastes absolutely wonderful.${prompt};
If I don't have my eight cups a day, I just can't function. I'm not the only one, either.${prompt};
That's why business is booming here. Every time I leave the house, I find myself wandering here inadvertently.${prompt};
Would you like a sip, too?${prompt};
Isn't this a beautiful teacup?;
I always drink my chai from a glass cup. I wouldn't have it any other way!${prompt};
I could really use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} right now. It goes so well with tea...${prompt};
I thought you were being awfully quiet. So you were thinking about ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} again, were you? Just forget it, already.${prompt};
You aren't upset about it?;
He had the nerve to snatch it right out of my hands as I was about to take a bite!${prompt};
Of course I don't think it's fair.;
Hey, you've never tried ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, have you?${prompt};
It's a famous Near Eastern confectionery. Ulamaal and I simply can't get enough of it.${prompt};
We finally managed to get the ingredients and whip up a batch ourselves, but our boss nabbed it right in front of our noses.${prompt};
I'm going to make jelly out of that guy if I ever get my hands on him!${prompt};
I don't think Ulamaal will ever be the same again if we don't do something. Do you think you could bring us three ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt};
If you help us, we'll let you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, too. Sorry to bother you for such a menial task, but we are counting on you!${prompt};
You should be able to gather ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the beehives of the Wajaom Woodlands.${prompt};
Oh, you managed to find some ${item-plural: 1[2]}. Now we can make ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Thank you!;
Have some chai until Qutiba makes a fresh batch of ${item-singular: 0[2]} for us!${prompt};
Qutiba, is it ready yet?${prompt};
Not yet.${prompt};Pas encore.${prompt}
Qutibaaa...${prompt};
Not yet, Ulamaal!${prompt};
Not yet, I said!${prompt};
I didn't even say anything...${prompt};
Sorry, it's becoming a habit.${prompt};
All finished! Let me know how it tastes!${prompt};
It's finally time! Oh, how I have waited!${prompt};
It can't be...${prompt};
My ${item-singular: 0[2]}...my...uwaaagh!${prompt};
Come on, things aren't so bad...${prompt};
H-how could he...;
Right before my very eyes...;
...Twice!${prompt};
I suspected that this would happen, so I made sure to hide it where he couldn't find it this time.${prompt};
H-huh? Then what was that a moment ago?${prompt};
The softest Tavnazian sheep liver I could find. It's a delicacy, so he has no room to complain.${prompt};
Oh. Well, isn't that nice!;
Teatime for me!${prompt};
You and the boss are the same when it comes to ${item-singular: 0[2]}...like a couple of kids.${prompt};
Oh, and here's your portion. I'm sure you won't be able to get enough of it after the first bite, so I'll go ahead and teach you the recipe.${prompt};
Are you ready?;Es-tu prêt?
I'm only going to say this once, so listen closely.${prompt};
First, you need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...;
Oh yes, and the ${item-plural: 0[2]} you just brought me.${prompt};
That should be all you need, but I think that it will still be rather difficult if you have no experience in making sweets.${prompt};
You can't expect me to give out the recipe for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} every time you happen to forget it.${prompt};
If you want to hear it again, you must bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
You already forgot how to make ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
You seem to be getting quite good at determining the enemy's weak points, so I would like to take this opportunity to broaden your horizons a bit. What do you say?${prompt};
What would you like to attempt?;
${selection-lines};
Finding Faults.;
The Art of War.;
Nothing.${prompt};
The beastmen are our greatest threat. I would greatly appreciate it if you led an investigation to discover their weaknesses.${prompt};
We have a new unit that is struggling in its fight against the enemy.${prompt};
They are up against some truly formidable foes...the orobon, the wamouracampa, and the puk.${prompt};
We have accumulated bits of information with every battle, but I would prefer to save our true strength for the beastman raids on the city.${prompt};
So I would like to request that you lead an investigation to build on the information that we already have.${prompt};
First, let me tell you what we have learned so far. Which monster would you like to know about?${prompt};
Ask about which monster?;
${selection-lines};
Orobon.;
Wamouracampa.;
Puk.${prompt};
We are in the process of studying ways to soothe the orobon's anger when it has suffered a serious wound.${prompt};
The current theory states that the solution may lie in our attack frequency.${prompt};
Remember that a battle is not won only by the sword. You must also cure wounds from time to time. Keep your eye on the enemy, and react as the occasion demands.${prompt};
If that does not work, then look around you. Orobon live deep in the ocean, so perhaps you can use water to pacify the beast.${prompt};
And do not forget that working with a friend can sometimes accomplish tasks that would be impossible alone.${prompt};
Would you like to investigate this enemy?${prompt};
Investigate the orobon?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a try!;
Not now.${prompt};
Orobon can be found on Arrapago Reef near Lovers' Rocks. We are counting on you.${prompt};
We have experimented with a wide variety of techniques during our fights with wamouracampa, but we still have not found an effective strategy due to their strong defenses. We are in the process of investigating ways to penetrate these defenses...${prompt};
Currently we are studying the creature's physical state. No matter how strong its defenses are, it cannot keep them up while ailing.${prompt};
However, focusing too much on its condition can be distracting. Do not forget the battle.${prompt};
And when that does not work, you should look around you.${prompt};
Wamouracampa prefer the dark, so you may be able to blind it if you can find a bright light.${prompt};
Investigate the wamouracampa?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a try!;
Not now.${prompt};
Wamouracampa can be found in Halvung near a pool of magma, surrounded by two halls on each side. We are counting on you.${prompt};
Puks are quick to run from danger, and avoid battle when possible. We are in the process of investigating ways to prevent the creatures' escape.${prompt};
Currently we are thinking that it might be best to mask our approach.${prompt};
We may be able to use certain foods to attract the beasts. Puks seem to favor fruit that are the same color as their bodies.${prompt};
If that does not lower their guard, you will have to stop them with the most powerful attacks you can manage.${prompt};
Investigate the puk?;
${selection-lines};
I'll give it a try!;
Not now.${prompt};
Puks can be found in Mamook near the waterfall. We are counting on you.${prompt};
Did you discover an effective strategy to use against the beasts? Please report your findings.${prompt};
Stop an orobon's rage by...;

Once again, thank you for your assistance. Which enemy would you like to investigate this time?${prompt};
All right.;
Let me tell you what we have learned so far. Which monster would you like to know about?${prompt};

Which would you like to see?;
${selection-lines};
Success.;
Failure.${prompt};
I have just received a report stating that the beastmen have begun raiding the areas around town. We must investigate the strength of their forces.${prompt};
Not again!;
Geez, don't the beastmen have anything better to do?${prompt};
This particular group of beastmen appears to be acting independently of the forces that have been raiding Al Zahbi.${prompt};
No problem... Just let us at 'em!${prompt};
And you think that will help, do you?${prompt};
If my memory serves correctly, we were the ones who chased the beastmen from town not long ago.${prompt};
Not you guys again...${prompt};
The captain of the Dark Wolves, Minfram, has stated that we no longer need the Red Foxes' services.${prompt};
That's not for the likes of you to decide!${prompt};
I will not beat around the bush with you. We cannot trust our lives to those who befriend beastmen.${prompt};
No telling when we'll end up with your knives in our backs...${prompt};
How dare you suggest we would betray the Empire!${prompt};
Just remember, choose your friends wisely...;
Well then, we have a battle to prepare for. If you'll excuse us...${prompt};
Hahaha...fools.${prompt};
Bwahaha...${prompt};
Think they can get ahead of us, do they!?${prompt};
I am sorry you had to see that...${prompt};
It seems the Dark Wolves do not take kindly to my Red Foxes. They come to provoke us often.${prompt};
They have been giving us trouble ever since the incident with Isween.${prompt};
Captain Minfram will not give us any opportunity to explain what Isween was trying to do.${prompt};
I apologize for the trouble, but do you think you could talk to him for us?${prompt};
I believe he is at Shararat Teahouse...${prompt};
Minfram is probably at Shararat Teahouse now. Please explain to him what really happened between Isween and the beastmen.${prompt};
What d'ya want, kid? Got a bone to pick with me?${prompt};
So you came to explain about Isween for the Red Foxes, did ya?${prompt};
You've gotta be kiddin' me. Get outta here!${prompt};
Well? How many times do I have to tell ya to get lost?${prompt};
Isween's...friend, or whatever you wanna call that vicious Mamool Ja, kidnapped my daughter!${prompt};
I could care less why! The fact is that my daughter was in danger. I don't need to hear your pathetic excuses.${prompt};
I always figured that Mishhar was a suspicious character, anyway...${prompt};
It all started back when I was just second captain of the Dark Wolves...${prompt};
Captain, we must turn back, or the Dark Wolves will fall!${prompt};
No... Just take a look at the enemy's numbers. We won't be able to make it to town without help. But if we can just break through the enemy's front lines, we should be able to meet up with another unit soon... We have no choice! Let's go!${prompt};
Arrrgh!;
Captain!${prompt};
Hurry... You must keep going!${prompt};
Captain!!!${prompt};
Sir, the enemy will arrive soon! We await your orders!${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
A voice...?${prompt};
I hear voices! Let's go!${prompt};
I saw it with my own eyes. He ordered a beastman to kill the captain of the Red Foxes...${prompt};
But I had no evidence to support my claim, and he was promoted to captain. Everyone was whispering that he killed the captain out of greed for power, and Mishhar said nothing to convince them otherwise.${prompt};
Either way, that guy is bad news. He's got connections with those vile beastmen, and I'm on to him now.${prompt};
You go tell Mishhar he can't slip through my fingers forever. Justice will be served, and I'll be carrying the platter. Got it, kid?${prompt};
So Minfram witnessed that unfortunate event...${prompt};
You said nothing to him, correct?${prompt};
That's good.;
Please leave me alone for a while...${prompt};
Well, look what the cat dragged in...if it isn't the Red Foxes.${prompt};
Some fools go on about how they've got “a good balance” thanks to the variety in their unit...but to me, all it looks like is a disorganized jumble led by two fools who can't even agree on anything.;
A real waste of soldiers, that's for sure...${prompt};
Captain, your attacks are too direct. Might I suggest that you may sometimes find more subtle methods to be effective?${prompt};
This is my style. You, on the other hand, use your head too much. You might find that loosening up sometimes gives you more power.${prompt};
One in a position of leadership must formulate an effective strategy, no matter the situation.${prompt};
An effective strategy...? Yes, I suppose that is important, too...${prompt};
But nothing is fully predictable... That is the nature of battle.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Captain!${prompt};
What is the matter?${prompt};
The beastmen are gathering their forces in Mamook. I am sure they're waiting for an opportunity to strike!${prompt};
If they attack Al Zahbi with those numbers, even the Serpent Generals will be swept away by the tide of battle! We must strike first. Scouts from the Dark Wolves have sent a message to their commander calling for battle!${prompt};
What about those three soldiers...?${prompt};
I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but after finishing their work...they were found by an enemy unit...${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
You have our apologies, but the smoke given off from the enemy's fires thwarted our attempts to search for them! There was nothing we could do...${prompt};
I've heard enough.;
You should rest now.${prompt};
Sorry, but do you think you could come to Mamook, too? We'll have to cut through the armies of the Savagelands in order to find the three missing soldiers.${prompt};
I have a bad feeling about all of this... I hope they are okay...${prompt};
My intuition tells me that they have been taken to the Jade Sepulcher. Please go on ahead. I will join you shortly.${prompt};
My scouts are still being held captive in the Jade Sepulcher. We must save them! I will join you shortly.${prompt};
Everyone is safe now, thanks to you. You have my utmost gratitude.${prompt};
If only I had known you earlier...maybe I could have found a better way. ...No, I must not think such things.${prompt};
What Minfram told you is true. Long ago, I betrayed my captain, Rafsween...${prompt};
You have made a wise decision...;
I always placed great faith in my own judgment. I always tried to devise the best strategy possible.${prompt};
But...even thinking back on the captain's last words, I cannot help but think that just that once, another strategy might have been better. I am not sure if my choice was for the best or not.${prompt};
As he fell, I caught a glimpse of a smile on the captain's face. I would rather he viewed me with contempt than... I still cannot forget that smile.${prompt};
Once again, you've done me a great service...${prompt};
Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt};
Isween and Captain Rafsween stuck to their own paths. Perhaps there is no single best strategy... We all have our own style.${prompt};
That's why even if my methods are mistaken, I shall see them through...${prompt};
I can see you are a most inquisitive individual.${prompt};
Allow me to feed that burning curiosity with a delectable nugget of knowledge.${prompt};
You are familiar with the Ruins of Alzadaal?${prompt};
Yes, those expansive ruins that honeycomb the western regions of this mighty nation.${prompt};
Mount Zhayolm, Arrapago Reef, Bhaflau Thickets, the Silver Sea...;
Wonderfully rare pieces of armor have been discovered within the remnants at all of these locations.${prompt};
How wonderfully rare, you ask?${prompt};
Why, these relics are so splendidly rare that even I, an avid collector, have been unable to acquire a single piece!${prompt};
Rumors among my fellow armor aficionados say that these lost treasures belonged to foreign mercenaries that fell in battle while escorting an archaeological research team.${prompt};
The rumors also say that these were no ordinary mercenaries, but famous adventurers to whom the Imperial Palace extended a personal and lucrative invitation...${prompt};
Funded by the inexhaustible coffers of the palace, the exquisite armor they wore was forged by the finest craftsmen, without regard for trivial matters such as “cost.”${prompt};
Oh, how I would dearly love to behold such masterpieces...${prompt};
But let us not dwell on such negative emotions.;
I have piqued your interest, yes?${prompt};
And now I have a request: I would ask that should you come into possession of such a wondrous treasure, that you surrender it to my greater expertise.${prompt};
Though I may seem quite savory, I have connections with the Al Zahbi underground--specifically the Rogue Artisan Guild. They have expressed an interest in examining the craftsmanship of this armor.${wait-36: 2};
Although I cannot deny my own desire to gaze upon...${prompt};
Ahem. Naturally, I do not make this request devoid of the promise of compensation. After the armor is examined, it will be returned to you in pristine condition, reforged into a more powerful form.${prompt};
Perhaps this catalog will better explain what you stand to gain...${prompt};

As the mediator in this transaction, I also ask the paltry sum of 6 ${item-plural: 0[2]} and 10 ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
After the meticulous ministrations of the Rogue Artisan Guild, the armor will be returned to you as an item of true magnificence.${prompt};
There are five sets of armor that can be forged in this way.${prompt};
You will have the chance to select which of these wondrous sets of armor you wish the Rogue Artisan Guild to focus their attention upon.${prompt};
As long as the guild isn't in the middle of reforging the set you have chosen, you can change your mind at any time.${prompt};
Feel free to bring me even a single piece you have found in the remnants--I shall store it in my gallery with the utmost care and vigilance.${prompt};
Be aware that I cannot accept pieces from more than one set at a time. I would dearly love to store them all, but the space is limited.${prompt};
My gallery was meant to house my own personal collection, but...<sob>.${prompt};
Ahem. Yes. I will gladly offer the use of my gallery, if only to display those treasures, for a short while...${prompt};
Do not be concerned by my zeal--the armor will be available to you at any time.${prompt};
I anxiously await any news of your success in obtaining these truly epic pieces.${prompt};
It has come to my attention that weapons of extraordinary quality have also been discovered within the ruins. I would be more than happy to offer the use of my gallery should you acquire any of these masterful pieces.${prompt};
Sadly, though, I originally fashioned my display cases and cabinets for the express purpose of housing fine armors.;
Weapons must to be stored separately and carefully, to ensure they don't suffer any nicks or dings.;
Should you want me to store a weapon, I'm afraid I'll have to ask that you contribute ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to my gallery.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Turning in a weapon for safekeeping will result in all data associated with that weapon to be reset. Please exercise caution!${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Previous page.;
None.${prompt};
This is the weapon you wish returned?;
${selection-lines};
This is it.;
No, not this.${prompt};
Most excellent. I see you have the items required for the ${choice: 1}[head piece/body piece/hands/legs/feet] of the ${choice: 0}[Ares Plate Armor/Skadi Leather Armor/Usukane Armor/Marduk Jubbah/Morrigan Robe].${prompt};
This is most certainly armor from the Ruins of Alzadaal. Soon you will have all the items required to create the ${choice: 1}[head piece/body piece/hands/legs/feet] of the ${choice: 0}[Ares Plate Armor/Skadi Leather Armor/Usukane Armor/Marduk Jubbah/Morrigan Robe].${prompt};
I shall gladly store this armor in my gallery for the time being. How my precious collection grows...${prompt};
Ah...of course I realize my custody of the armor is only temporary.;
Yes. Temporary.${prompt};
Please, I do not wish to cheapen the value of my gallery with multiple displays of the same armor.${prompt};
My gallery is now fit to bursting with rare and wondrous armor.;
I feel positively dizzy. I suppose it is time for you to prepare my fee.${prompt};
These are the items required to create the ${choice: 1}[head piece/body piece/hands/legs/feet] of the ${choice: 0}[Ares Plate Armor/Skadi Leather Armor/Usukane Armor/Marduk Jubbah/Morrigan Robe].${prompt};
But it appears, my greedy friend, that you already own this particular part.${prompt};
I will require the entire fee all at once, if you would be so kind.${prompt};
Or are you attempting to store such things in my gallery?;
It is a place to display the glory of arms and armor and nothing else, my friend.${prompt};
You have yet to bring me all of the necessary items.;
I will ask for my fee once you have everything ready.${prompt};
Yes, this should cover my expenses for ordering the ${choice: 1}[head piece/body piece/hands/legs/feet] of the ${choice: 0}[Ares Plate Armor/Skadi Leather Armor/Usukane Armor/Marduk Jubbah/Morrigan Robe].${prompt};
I will set the artisans to work at once.;
I know I would be anxious in your position, but try to exercise some patience before returning to claim your armor.${prompt};
Like I've told you before, I typically only store pieces of armor in my gallery.;
The special attention and care a fine weapon requires will cost you an extra ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
This is a weapon found in the ruins!? Simply breathtaking!;
I shall most happily display it within my gallery.${prompt};
Ah! Of course you shall retain all ownership rights and privileges that pertain to the weapon.;
If you wish it returned, you have merely to ask...${prompt};
I have not a single spare display case remaining, I'm afraid. My collection of legendary weapons is perfect and complete!;
I must say, the daily care of these artifacts is quite demanding...though I do love it so!${prompt};
That weapon already graces my gallery, my treasure-hunting friend. I need but one of each!${prompt};
Your armor is being crafted as we speak.;
Such magnificence takes time.${prompt};
Here is your completed armor.;
Such masterful work...<sob>.${prompt};
Grrr... Who in Altana's name does that vixen think she is!? I'll quit that company of herrrs, just watch me!${prompt};
And why can't those three idiots keep theirrr traps shut? Once one pops, they just can't stop, can they?;
If they'd just go back to holding each other's hands, I could concentrate on my work--not that I'm going to be working here much longerrr!${prompt};
If you'd just calm down once in a while, maybe we could finally finish a mission without having to return to our home points after every other battle.${prompt};
It was only because you went off ahead of us that we ended up ambushed by those beastmen.${prompt};
Hey, don't look at me! If I hadn't taken the lead, we'd have been hiding behind those rocks waiting for Foudeel to make up his mind on whether we should lace our gaiters with single or double knots!${prompt};
I was simply attempting to contrive a battle plan that even Bashraf could not foul up.${prompt};
Hey! Don't try to put all the blame on me!${prompt};
Look who's talking!${prompt};
<Sigh> Not one of them man enough to take rrresponsibility for their own blunders. I swear, they haven't changed a bit since their mercenarrry days.${prompt};
Now with all this recent quarrelling, I'm usually the one that has to bail them out every time they bungle an assignment.${prompt};
And that's why I thought Tehf was tugging my tail when she told me that the three had signed up to be volunteer soldiers.${prompt};
Fighting for the Empire... Could they have finally recovered some of those beans that they spilled oh so long ago?${prompt};
Foul up? I don't foul up anything!;
Most of the time...;
Excuse you!${prompt};
Huh?${prompt};
I... Uh... You didn't see anything!${prompt};
Are you okay, Bash?${prompt};
I think so.${prompt};
Now where were we?${prompt};
Huh? Oh, that. It was all my fault. I'm sorry guys. I'll try to do better next time.${prompt};
What's got into you all of a sudden? If you've something to say, say it.${prompt};
No. I was just thinking that maybe I am the reason we always fail our missions. I'm not the greatest fighter, you know.${prompt};
Maybe you could teach me, Wahboud.${prompt};
Well, well. It looks like that fall finally knocked some sense into you. Come on, I know a good place in Wajaom we can practice.${prompt};
Ah yes, I know the place of which you speak. Perhaps the lesser colibri will provide ample fodder for Bashraf's training.${prompt};
Um, actually, I was hoping we could go alone.${prompt};
What do you mean? I know Foudeel can be a bit annoying, but that's no reason to leave him out. You'll want to suck up a little of his brain after basking in my brawn, anyway.${prompt};
I don't know if I can handle all that at once. I think I'd better just concentrate on one thing at a time. You understand, right?${prompt};
You have made your point quite clear. We shall work on refining your mind at a later date.${prompt};
Thanks.${prompt};
Now that's odd. You three are usually like bluepeas in a pod.${prompt};
I think not, fine lady. To the contrary, there are instances where the needs of the individual take precedence over those of the group.${prompt};
Though, it would be an atrocity if one of those individuals were to become more skilled in the arts of combat than another. Might you spare some time and accompany me in polishing my fencing skills in the woodlands?${prompt};
"As much as I'd like to say ""yes,"" my heart, mind, and common sense advise otherwise. Sorry, Foud.${prompt}";
But what about this hearty adventurer here? ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] obviously has a lot of free time on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] hands to be out here listening to us.${prompt};
Good day, adventurer. My name is Foudeel P. Fessenphepper III. There has never been a confrontation in which my tactical prowess could not provide my allies the upper hand.${prompt};
If you wish to experience my grace and prowess firsthand, I shall be waiting immediately outside the secret passage leading into the Wajaom wilds.${prompt};
Quite a show he's putting on, but the truth is that he just wants to keep an eye on his two buddies.${prompt};
Sure, he's a pompous, crumpet-eating show-off, but there is a glimmer of good deep down there somewherrre. Why don't you go and play along, just this time? Thanks. I'll owe you one.${prompt};
Foudeel should be waiting rrright outside the secret passage to the Wajaom Woodlands. Do this for me and I promise I'll make it up to you.${prompt};
That was quick. How was the...training?${prompt};
Uneventful.${prompt};
Hey, I was just asking...${prompt};
Foudeel! Why don't you join us? There are more than enough marids for everybody.${prompt};
I believe I'll pass.${prompt};
What's with you?;
Come on! Turn that frown upside down!${prompt};
Perhaps another time.${prompt};
Hey, Wahb, he says he doesn't want to come.${prompt};
Whatever.${prompt};
Did I miss something?${prompt};
So that's why Foudeel has his subligarrr in a jumble.${prompt};
Well, I wouldn't worry too much. Knowing those three, they'll be back sipping chai before the sun sets.${prompt};
Although on the other hand, Foudeel can be a little stubborn at times...${prompt};
Hey, do you think you could go check up on him for me? I'll owe you one, okay?${prompt};
If he is rrreally as upset as I think he is, he'll probably be over at Shararat's drowning in his sorrows.${prompt};
I'm positive that you'll find Foudeel wallowing away at the Shararat Teahouse. Ask arrround for him when you get there.${prompt};
Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. May I interest you in today's special--pamama thundermelon chai a la mode?${prompt};
You're looking for Foudeel? Oh, well, he's sitting over there.${prompt};
Or should I say, loitering... He's usually such a good customer, but today the boy has just been standing there, brooding over his distilled water.${prompt};
Oh, it is you...${prompt};
You may scurry back off to your adventures, now. I require none of your or Kubhe's shallow sentiment.${prompt};
<Sigh>;
I cannot begin to fathom why Bashraf insists on spending time alone with Wahboud.${prompt};
Wasn't it that milksop who always declared there was nothing that could tear the three of us apart? The three of us...${prompt};
But what about me!?${prompt};
Foudeel.;
I wanted to apologi--;
Hey wait. This is that ${choice-player-gender}[guy/chick] who was hanging around with you a while back. What have you two been up to?${prompt};
What does it matter...?${prompt};
Why are you so distant lately? Are you trying to tell me this adventurer is more important to you than I am?${prompt};
And what if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is? Must I receive permission from you regarding with whom I make my acquaintances?${prompt};
!${prompt};
Oh... I guess you don't... I'm sorry... I was...${prompt};
I was just a little worried, but I guess you'll be fine on your own.${prompt};
Be seeing you.${prompt};
The nerve of that mindless brute... I wonder where he has left Bashraf.${prompt};
If anything terrible were to befall him...${prompt};
Nothing but whimpering soldiers, meddling adventurers, and snooping Mithra... Why can't I get any paying customers!?${prompt};
Foudeel is still at the Shararat Teahouse? Wow... Whateverrr has him down must be really serious.${prompt};
Hm? Have I been over therrre to check up on him? Hah! I haven't moved a muscle since we last talked. Just ask anybody.${prompt};
Spying? How darrre you accuse me of spying! Obserrrving is a much better way to put it.${prompt};
I was minding my business, indulging myself in a pamama thundermelon chai a la mode, when I simply happened to hear my good frrriends Foudeel and Wahboud having a rather heated conversation at the next table.${prompt};
You think there is something wrrrong with them?${prompt};
I-I have no idea what you're talking a-about.${prompt};
"I removed the words ""scheming,"" ""conniving,"" and ""hustling"" from my vocabulary after my last rrrun-in with those three.${prompt}";
I'm clean, I tell you!;
${selection-lines};
You do look awfully nice today.;
Alright. I give up.${prompt};
Good! Now off with you. I'm a busy woman!${prompt};
Wh-why would I know the reason those thrrree are acting like nutkins in a peanut field?${prompt};
I do, don't I? Some women find it harrrd to keep up their looks, but for me, maintaining this pristine visage comes as natural as waking up in the morrrning.${prompt};
I know, I know. There are thousands of girrrls out there with charm, and thousands more with faces to die for. But only once in a generation does there come along someone blessed with a perrrfect combination of both--an angel created in the image of the goddess herself.${prompt};
<Sigh>... And I know that a woman with so much shouldn't have to lie about what she may or may not have done...${prompt};
I'm sorry, ${name-player}!;
It's all my fault!;
Do you rrremember the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you brought me before?${prompt};
You know... The love potion.${prompt};
I was going to have that old witch brew up some medicine to help me...um...iron out a few of the wrrrinkles in my otherwise flawless personality, but it turned out that the whole thing was a hoax.${prompt};
Now that I didn't need the water anymore, I was going to give it back to Ekhu.${prompt};
But on my way, I kind of rrran into one of those thrrree creepy guys always hanging around Al Zhabi's Mithra...;
...and maybe spilled a little of the concoction on his jerrrkin.${prompt};
The prrroblem here being that anyone sprinkled with the luminous water will fall in love with the first perrrson he sees...${prompt};
...which I'm guessing was either Foudeel or Wahboud.${prompt};
Heh heh...?${prompt};
Do I know how to rrremove the effects of the medicine?${prompt};
Unfortunately, no. I even asked Ekhu, but she was as stumped as I (just not as beautiful).${prompt};
A-anyway! The whole thing was an accident. You can't blame somebody for something they never intended to do, even if that something was causing a guy to fall for anotherrr's bone harness.${prompt};
Where could he be...?${prompt};
Maybe good ol' Kubhe will know.${prompt};
I already told you! It was all an accident. If I could go back and change everything, I would, but I can't, so I won't!${prompt};
Kubhe! Kubhe!;
Have you seen Wahboud?${prompt};
Can't say that I have. Did you check the market?${prompt};
Yeah... Twice.;
Where could he have gone? I hope he isn't upset with me or anything...${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him for a while, either. Usually he's around here lifting weights or doing pushups when he's not with you or Foudeel.${prompt};
It's like... It's like he's been avoiding me...${prompt};
(Upset...? Avoiding him...? What in Altana's name is going on here? Could it be that Bashraf... Naw, it couldn't be...could it?)${prompt};
(Now why is he trying to hide from him?)${prompt};
What does that Foudeel think he's doing, having tea with some stray adventurer?${prompt};
What's ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] got that I don't? Certainly not the muscles!${prompt};
(What the...? Don't tell me Wahboud has lost it as well!)${prompt};
Foudeel!${prompt};
Hey!;
Bashraf. I have been combing the Empire for you.${prompt};
There is something that has been gnawing at my inner soul.${prompt};
Your inner what?${prompt};
(Uh-oh... Here it comes...)${prompt};
Something that I have wanted to tell you for the longest time...${prompt};
But Foudeel...${prompt};
(Whoa, this is getting good!)${prompt};
And I have finally realized what it was.${prompt};
(Out with it, loverboy!)${prompt};
Bashraf... I...${prompt};
(Come on! More talking and less ellipsing!)${prompt};
W-wait!${prompt};
I can't let you do this.${prompt};
(Yes you can! Yes you can!)${prompt};
You see, Foudeel, there's something that I've been dying to tell Wahboud...${prompt};
Wha--!?;
Huh?${prompt};
Well, spill it, chap! If you have something to say, then say it. Don't leave us in suspense.${prompt};
Yeah... Um... I was going to say...${prompt};
!${prompt};
Ummm...${prompt};
(This halfwit's brain has gone and shriveled up to the size of a rolanberry!)${prompt};
Oh well, I'm sure I'll remember later.${prompt};
So, Foudeel, what was it you were dying to tell me?${prompt};
Eh?;
Why... It was... I...${prompt};
That...that matter is no longer of any import.${prompt};
Wahboud, did not you also have something you wished to say?${prompt};
Me?${prompt};
When did I say anything?${prompt};
Wait a minute, what the heck are we doing here, anyway?${prompt};
Absolutely. Whose idea was it to convene in this filthy corner?${prompt};
Convene? What are you guys talking about?${prompt};
What am I talking about? I'm talking about you wanting to go out and train all of a sudden. This all started with you, Bashraf.${prompt};
Me wanting to train has nothing to do with us “convening” here!${prompt};
I'm lost. One minute they'rrre about to step out of the proverbial wardrobe, and the next they're back to fighting like nothing happened.${prompt};
Love potion!?${prompt};
So I wasn't just imagining things!${prompt};
I guess it wore off at just the rrright time, though. I don't want to even think of what might have happened if it hadn't! Okay, maybe I'll think about it a little... Heh heh heh...${prompt};
But wait a minute... Didn't Tehf say that she only spilled the waterrr on Bashraf?${prompt};
Then why would Foudeel and Washoud act as if they had--${prompt};
Maybe the water splashed on all three... They werrre standing fairly close to each other.${prompt};
Yes! I think we've finally solved the mysterrry!;
(But wait... Why were they standing so close to each other in the first place...?)${prompt};
Anyway, I'm sorry you had to get involved in all that.${prompt};
I said I'd owe you one. Here, take this and let's call it even, okay?${prompt};
Oh! I remember ye! Those pictures of yers sure did take me back...${prompt};
But after takin' a closer gander at that one from Caedarva, I spotted something a mite queer...${prompt};
'Twas a ghost, I tell ye! A specter! A spook, come from the depths of hell t' drag back lost souls!${prompt};
At first, I was tremblin' in me britches, but after a while the whole situation gone got me excited. An' that's when I decided I'd try capturin' curious happenin's 'round the city.${prompt};
This here place is brimmin' with strange folk come from all 'cross the globe. Didn't take more than two shakes of a colibri's tail before I had meself hundreds of pictures linin' me workshop.${prompt};
Problem be, unlike scenery, dang people keep movin' all over the place. If they'd only go and stand still for a second, I wouldn't have a mountain of blurred shots.${prompt};
But that wasn't going t' stop ol' Balakaf! No siree! If me ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} couldn't cut the cake, then I'd just have t' invent somethin' that would!${prompt};
And that something would be this--me brand-fandangled ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt};
The photopticator can capture up to five whole seconds of movin' images on this thin strip of pliable film I synthesized.${prompt};
But recently me rheumy's been actin' up and I can't hold the contraption still enough t' record anything legible.${prompt};
And that's why I be needing yer help again, youngin'. Will ye help an old man like meself live out his final dream?${prompt};
Ye did such a fine job with the still images, I'm downright positive ye'll have no problem with the “move-ys”!${prompt};
Oh, I forgot t' tell ye...${prompt};
Once ye've recorded the image onto the film, the gears inside go and reset t' their original position.${prompt};
If ye try recordin' again, it'll erase what ye did before!${prompt};
What I'm tryin' t' get at is, that once ye've found somethin' ye like, come back here before doin' anything else! Got it?${prompt};
You seem the understanding type, my friend. Might you not listen to my humble plea?${prompt};
It seems that there is a thief among my patrons, and his despicable deeds are driving all the poor lords and ladies from my act.${prompt};
If the fiend isn't brought to justice, I may just have to pack up and move my show elsewhere...${prompt};
Begin recording?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
${color-alt: 15}Now recording...;
${color-alt: 15}The photopticator goes silent.;
Hm?;
I could have sworn I felt something brush up against my vest...${prompt};
My--my wallet is gone!${prompt};
All of a sudden I feel a bit lightaru.${prompt};
Waaaaahhh! My gil pouch has been stolen, and with it my life savings!${prompt};
I can't get enough of this show! No matter how many times I see that adorable puppet pirouette, I always find myself coming back for more.${prompt};
What is this? My wallet seems to have misplaced itself... Perhaps it stayed at home...${prompt};
Just between you and me, do you feel that there may be something lacking from our fine establishment's cuisine?${prompt};
I say the culprit is our limited selection of titillating ingredients from Aradjiah and beyond.${prompt};
I say the culprit is our chef's refusal to step from the boundaries of traditional Aht Urhganian spices.${prompt};
I hear the customers whisper, but I just cannot see the problem. We use only the finest ingredients....${prompt};
Greetings, traveller! Have you heard of our ${color: 5}special of the day${color: 1}?${prompt};
Ratihb came up with the idea himself. However, because we only serve ten specials a day, we're sold out before the first customer even sits down.${prompt};
I haven't even had the chance to try one...${prompt};
Hmmm... What shall I use today?${prompt};
Adventurer, I need your honest opinion.${prompt};
I'm pondering over what to focus on in today's special. Which do you think is more important?${prompt};
You should focus on...;
${selection-lines};
Ingredients.;
Spices.;
Water.;
Asking someone else.${prompt};
Now that you mention it, maybe my cooking has been a little lacking in that department.${prompt};
Now let me get to work on the special...${prompt};
Step right up! Today's special of the day is served!${prompt};
And that was the last one! Today's special is sold out!${prompt};
Did you happen to see a Qiqirn anywhere near Balrahn Way?${prompt};
The past few weeks, one of those conniving rats has been coming around here playing tricks on me and my son.${prompt};
It's hard enough for a single mother to put up with the antics of this little scamp without having to worry about any other vermin!${prompt};
That Qiqirn ate one of my ginger cookies! If I get my hands on him...!${prompt};
Have I seen a suspicious-looking Qiqirn around lately?${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I thought I saw one hiding behind that pillar over therrre...${prompt};
A soldier's body must be as seasoned as his mind. That is why I summon my unit here every day at noon to train.${prompt};
However, the real reason we do our running here is so that the citizens can gain a sense of security, knowing that the Empire is constantly striving to protect them.${prompt};
Recently, I've been worried with the pace at which my apothecary goes through its catalysts.${prompt};
Perhaps I am simply so engrossed in my research that I fail to notice how much I use with each experimentation.${prompt};
Our new apprentice has been acting quite strange lately. Every night, he leaves the laboratory for a few hours.${prompt};
None of our suppliers are open, so he cannot be purchasing ingredients... I wonder what in Altana's name he could be up to.${prompt};
What do we have here...;
This looks like ${choice: 0}[the puppetmaster's show/the Shararat Teahouse/Balrahn Way/the city guards/Philosopher's Alley]...but I don't see anything out of the ordinary.;
Sorry, ${name-player}, but ye'll have t' find me somethin' a little more stimulatin'.${prompt};
The picture's so blurry, I can't tell what in tarnation's happenin'.;
Sorry, ${name-player}, but if what ye saw was really worth seein', ye'll have t' try recordin' it again.${prompt};
Hold on there...!;
Looks like somethin' may be happenin', but me eyesight just ain't as good as it was back in the day. Sorry, ${name-player}, but if what ye saw was really worth seein', ye'll have t' try recordin' it again.${prompt};
!?;
Wait...;
Somebody just swiped that person's wallet!;
Hm? The puppetmaster told you that if he keeps losin' customers, he'll have to pack up and leave town?${prompt};
We can't let one scoundrel rob our city of its finest performer!${prompt};
Maybe this evidence will help catch the thief... I'll take it down to Balrahn Way right after me breakfast.${prompt};
Wait...;
That customer keeps linin' up to buy the special of the day!;
Why, just yesterday I went over to the teahouse t' get a tin of their tasty gruel, but they were all sold out...${prompt};
And no wonder! That swine has an appetite bigger than me bunyans! I'll take this move-y over there and see what ol' Shararat has t' say 'bout it!${prompt};
Wait...;
That pesky li'l Qiqirn looks like he be runnin' from somethin'!;
Hm? Ye say that lady Mushayra's been havin' trouble with the pest down at her shop, but he always escapes into Balrahn Way before she can catch 'im?${prompt};
That sounds like trouble a-brewin'... If the little rat were t' get his claws on me ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, he might ruin all me work!${prompt};
But thanks t' yer investimigatin', we now know where he's hidin'. I'll take this over t' Mushayra's right away and sees if we can't get a search party goin'.${prompt};
Wait...;
That youngin' at the end of the line just ducked off into a side alley!;
And these 'snappers are supposed t' be trainin' t' protect the city!${prompt};
We can't have slackers like that runnin' free among the ranks of our good men and women. I'll take this evidence down t' Hishahma right after me supper.${prompt};
Wait...;
It's kinda dark, but I think I sees some young fellers exchangin' packages... Whatever be wrong with that?;
Hm? Ye think the kid may be stealin' 'gredients from the apothecary and sellin' 'em on the black market!?${prompt};
Well, then this here be the evidence the guild'll need t' bring that criminal t' justice! I'll take it over right after I finish me chai.${prompt};
I must say, ${name-player}, ye sure have lived up t' me expectations.${prompt};
I think we got something goin' here...${prompt};
By recordin' pictures in me photopticator as evidence, maybe we can help more people in trouble!${prompt};
You don't mind goin' out into town for a little more work now, do ye? I'd do it meself, but me rheumy's been actin' up again...${prompt};
Oh, hold yer horses there.;
Let me remove the film in the photopticator and replace it with a new one. Wouldn't want ye erasin' that fine move-y.${prompt};
Alright! Good as new! Now get back out there and find me somethin' spiffy!${prompt};
But me gut tells me there're still more goin' on out in the city...and that ye're going t' find it!${prompt};
Did you hear the news, ${choice-player-gender}[fine sir/fine lady]? We finally caught the thief who was pilfering pennies from my patrons' pockets!${prompt};
And all thanks to Petrino! It was she who cornered the fiend after we received a tip from a friendly old man!;
Now the show can go on!${prompt};
I'm sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], but if you came to purchase more than one of today's specials, you no longer can. One special per customer, please.${prompt};
(Hopefully now this means I'll be able to finally buy myself one!)${prompt};
Oh, remember that conniving Qiqirn I told you about the other day? Well, we finally caught him!${prompt};
And does that take a load off my shoulders! Now if I could just figure out what to do with this bundle of trouble...${prompt};
Every time Mom chased him, that Qiqirn would hide behind one of those huge poles down on Balrahn Way.${prompt};
Then when he saw her coming, he'd just go around to the other side of the pole! But he wasn't expecting both me and my mom to come last time! Heh heh heh!${prompt};
Now I don't have to worry about anybody eating my snacks! I wonder what Mom'll give me today!${prompt};
The other day, I was informed by one of our citizens that a member of my unit was breaking ranks during our daily training exercises.${prompt};
Until I was shown that strange moving picture, I had believed the private was one of my best cadets...${prompt};
Now I know to think twice before letting my unit train alone. If it will help regain the trust of the citizens of Al Zahbi, then I will join my men in their exercises.${prompt};
Just the other day, an old man with a strange mechanical contraption stopped by our guild.${prompt};
He started going on about one of my apprentices stealing catalysts and secretly selling them on the black market. I was about to send for the authorities when he urged me to peer into his picture box.${prompt};
And that's when I saw the most amazing thing...;
But I couldn't be sure if my student was stealing, or merely slipping away for a few hours every night to call upon a forbidden lover. So, I decided to follow him and see what was truly occurring.${prompt};
And lo and behold, I spied my young boy handing a package of herbs to a man all dressed in black. That is when I stepped from the shadows and confronted them both!${prompt};
But after hearing that the man in black was not a merchant, but simply a poor soul who had asked my boy to bring him medicine for his sick mother, I decided to let him go back to his home with the package...the payment of which, of course, will be coming out of my apprentice's pay!${prompt};
${name-player}! I've been waitin' fer ye.${prompt};
Remember all them peoples we helped with me photopticator? Well, they just came by with a reward fer me services.${prompt};
I never did think that this here box could actually be used t' help folk.${prompt};
But ye know, it wasn't just me invention. Without you t' take them move-ys, those criminals and whatnot would still be roamin' the streets.${prompt};
Make a darn good team, we do, but I can't keep askin' ye t' assist me in me hobbies. Yer an adventurer, and I knows yer itchin' t' get back out there and do some adventurin'.${prompt};
And that's why I've decided t' go back t' the drawin' board and redesign me ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} so that anybody can use 'er.${prompt};
But before ye go, I have just one more thing t' ask ye.${prompt};
Oh, don't ye worry, it ain't nothin' too difficult.${prompt};
When I finish me next invention, I'd like if you were the first t' test 'er out.${prompt};
I don't think I could trust 'er in anybody else's hands.${prompt};
Now, take this reward from the townsfolk. You earned it more than I did.${prompt};
And here's a little somethin' from me, as well. Heh heh!${prompt};
You receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the Shararat Teahouse!${prompt};
You receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from Mushayra!${prompt};
You receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from Hishahma!${prompt};
You receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from Zyfhil!${prompt};
You receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the Alchemists' Guild!${prompt};

Thanks t' ye, me ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} was voted best invention of the week by the Al Zahbi board of inventors!${prompt};
Now, all I have t' do is fix 'er up so anybody can make their own move-ys!${prompt};

Papa! We have to do something!${prompt};
Silence! Do not speak to your father in such a way.${prompt};
But he might be in big trouble! Someone has to help him!${prompt};
There's nothing we can do about it. If I get involved, it'll just draw the Immortals' attention to me, and I'll never be able to do business in Al Zahbi again.${prompt};
But still...${prompt};
Stop your whining and help me with the shop!${prompt};
What was all that about?${prompt};
Oh, I get it.;
A moment ago, the Immortals came and arrested that guy's son, Mutihb.${prompt};
He's suspected of having dealings with the corsairs...${prompt};
The Immortals consider the corsairs their enemies.${prompt};
Just forget about it, already.;
That brat would just cause trouble if he were still here, anyway.${prompt};
Don't talk about Mutihb that way!${prompt};
If you're not going to help him, then I will!${prompt};
Sorry you had to see that.${prompt};
Seeing as I'm always busy with the shop, that kid's grown closer to his older brother than he has to me.${prompt};
But his brother Mutihb's such bad news, I always expected something like this to happen.${prompt};
He doesn't want his ways to rub off on his younger brother, so he orders me to keep his vile business a secret.${prompt};
Of course, that kind of craftiness is incomprehensible to a child.${prompt};
What am I supposed to do with that boy? He won't be able to do anything by himself.${prompt};
Sorry, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], but I can't leave my shop. Do you think you could go check on Wasuhd for me?${prompt};
You want to know about that kid?;
He kept going on about some corsair...${prompt};
What am I saying... Do you even know what a corsair is?${prompt};
I know...;
${selection-lines};
All about corsairs!;
Absolutely nothing.${prompt};
I won't have to waste my breath, then.;
Those forsaken corsairs are the cause of all my headaches...${prompt};
Well, I suppose that makes sense. Your run-of-the-mill adventurer doesn't get much chance to rub shoulders with that lot.${prompt};
The corsairs are a bunch of miscreants who have been marauding around this area.${prompt};
Wh-what's that!?${prompt};
What the hell is going on?${prompt};
Ugh...${prompt};
Damn corsairs!${prompt};
Mutihb!${prompt};
Let's get outta here!${prompt};
We won't let you escape! After them!${prompt};
Way to make an entrance, Immortals.${prompt};
While we'd love to stay and keep you company, I'm afraid we've got some business to take care of. If you'll excuse us...${prompt};
Regroup on the wing of the Seagull!;
Damn Qultada and his Seagull Phratrie... ${prompt};
I apologize, Sir Yazquhl...${prompt};
Don't just stand there! After them, before they go too far!${prompt};
Yes, sir!${prompt};
Thanks for helping out with Wasuhd earlier.${prompt};
I don't know what you did, but he's been a great kid lately.${prompt};
He's even been helping out with the shop...${prompt};
Anyway, I'm sure something good must have happened.${prompt};
Odds again... I win.${prompt};
I'm starting to hate this game...${prompt};
That's enough for now.;
You just don't have any luck.${prompt};
Just one more time! All I need is one more chance!${prompt};
Give it up, already.;
I have no intention of taking the shirt off your very back.${prompt};
Anyway, I've gotta go.${prompt};
If we ever happen to meet again, we can go another round.${prompt};
See you later!${prompt};
What's your problem?${prompt};
So you think it's funny, do ya?${prompt};
Nah. I was just impressed.${prompt};
Impressed? By what?${prompt};
You don't know?;
That girl's name is Yadhiwa, and she's pretty well known around here.${prompt};
Yadhiwa?${prompt};
Goodness, it looks like you really didn't know... Sorry, but she really swindled you.${prompt};
What? You mean she was cheating!?${prompt};
Oh, yes. She's very good at it. It was the first time I'd ever seen her do it, and I was quite impressed.${prompt};
Of course, that means amateurs like you get the short end of the stick.${prompt};
I'm gonna wring her neck...${prompt};
Hey hey, calm down. Anyway, it's partly your fault for not seeing through her devices.${prompt};
Ugh...${prompt};
Hey, adventurer!${prompt};
Get that girl back here for me. She can't have gone far yet.${prompt};
I can't believe I let her cheat me out of that much gold...${prompt};
I will reward you. Please help me!${prompt};
You're back!${prompt};
And you got my gold back, too! Thank you!${prompt};
From now on, I'm going to earn money the good old-fashioned way! No more betting for me!${prompt};
Hah, we'll see about that.${prompt};
Anyway, did you figure out where Yadhiwa headed off to?${prompt};
West? That's too bad... I was looking forward to seeing more of her amazing work.${prompt};
Tales of her earning ten million gil in one night have become legend in this town by now.${prompt};
I hope she comes back someday.${prompt};
Hey, there's something extra in this bag...${prompt};
I don't need this. I want nothing more to do with that fraud.${prompt};
Maybe Yadhiwa intended to give it to you...${prompt};
Oh, hello.;
Balajaha told me to give this to you the next time I saw you.${prompt};
Welcome to Shararat Teahouse! Relax and forget your troubles over a soothing cup of chai!${prompt};
Yooo want info? Nice info?${prompt};
“Clink clink”? Yooo know “clink clink”?${prompt};
Hundred tens? Ten hundreds? Yooo have?${prompt};
Cacaroon so happy!;
Yooo loooking for Twooo Hooorn, ya?${prompt};
Oooh?${prompt};
Cacaroon adore Twooo Hooorn.${prompt};
Two Hooorn fight for little guy. Do yooo know Two Horn only booolly big mean guy?${prompt};
Sometimes powerfoool people pooosh Cacaroon around because of Qiqirn loooks, ya?${prompt};
Twooo Hooorn fight croool ones for us, yooo see?${prompt};
Nobody know who Two Horn is. Maybe Cacaroon tooo?${prompt};
But do not ask too many questions, or Two Horn may come after yooo.${prompt};
Spoooky, ya?${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
Loooking Cacaroon's way?${prompt};
Hmmmmmmm...${prompt};
Poooor Cacaroon. Even though infooormation center, Cacaroon know nothing! If yooo want help, yooo must dooo self. So sooorry.${prompt};
I heardy-weard! You were talky-walking about Two Horn!${prompt};
Uh-oooh.${prompt};
Heh heh! I also happy-wappen to be on orders by the Empire to looky-wook for Two Horn. Would you likey-wike to help me investigate?${prompt};
I don't know what kindy-wind of monster it was that made cornstarch out of the guardy-wards, but the two of us working together could find out the facts, no probly-woblem!${prompt};
Help her investigate?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, why not?;
Nah, don't want to.${prompt};
H-how could you? You don't wanna work with a Tarutaru girly-wirl 'cause you think I'm weak? That's discrimination!${prompt};
That's the spiry-wirit! Two makes company!${prompt};
Aren't you thrilly-willed to work with such a cutesy-wutesy girl?${prompt};
Do yooo know what yooo are getting intooo? Cacaroon would refooose if Cacaroon were yooo...${prompt};
You shut your snouty-wout before I clamp your jaws together permy-wermanently with animal glue!${prompt};
Well then, shall we be off?;
Destination: Mamook!${prompt};
Hello, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]! It's good to see you again.${prompt};
It would seem my son has something to tell you. He's been waiting...${prompt};
There you are! Hey, over here!${prompt};
Nobody's looking, are they? Great.${prompt};
A member of the Seagull Phratrie came to me in disguise and left this wicked-looking gun with me. I'm supposed to give it to you.${prompt};
Don't worry about the price. He said it was a gift from Qultada.${prompt};
Boy, how I envy you...${prompt};
I don't know what you did for this, but to get something like this from Qultada himself, it must have been great!${prompt};
But he gave me the most important job of all...he said so himself! That means Qultada still trusts me more than you!${prompt};
${name-player}... It's me.${prompt};
The Empire knows my face, so I had to come in disguise.${prompt};
It is time to go now. Are you ready?${prompt};
Where are we going? I can think of several places they might be...${prompt};
We don't have time for this.${prompt};
I know Imutira.${prompt};
She burns with a desire for revenge. I am sure she will try to put Qultada through the same thing she went through.${prompt};
What does she plan to do to him?${prompt};
Throw him overboard, of course.${prompt};
There is a dock on Arrapago Reef.${prompt};
I would wager that that is where she is taking him.${prompt};
Hey, wait up!${prompt};
Well hello, Wasuhd. Have you been helping your father like a good boy?${prompt};
Is it true that Qultada is going to be executed? I heard some people talking at the teahouse...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Don't worry. Leave everything to us.${prompt};
Make some chai for us so we can relax when we get back, okay?${prompt};
...Okay. Got it.${prompt};
This is for you. You will need it to get on the ship.${prompt};
If you happen to lose it, ask Wasuhd for another. I will leave a spare with him.${prompt};
Let us go, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You don't have the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} anymore? How could you lose something like that?${prompt};
Take this and go to Qultada! Hurry!${prompt};
Welcome to Shararat Teahouse! Revitalize your mind and body with a refreshing cup of chai!${prompt};
I don't know what's gotten into Wasuhd.;
Sorry for the trouble, but I would appreciate it if you would check on him for me.${prompt};
Excooose me...${prompt};
Yes?;
...And who might you be?${prompt};
Am called Liliroon...${prompt};
This famooos detective agency, no?${prompt};
This place so different from long ago, Liliroon did not knooow.${prompt};
May speak to yooor boss?${prompt};
Eh?;
Something 'bout a detective agency?${prompt};
Ya got anything between those pointy ears of yours?${prompt};
You've got the fortune to be standin' in the enlightened and noble company of Salaheem's Sentinels, rrright hand of the Empress!${prompt};
Liliroon has request tooo make.${prompt};
This place help people in trouble, no?${prompt};
Look, I've been telling ya...${prompt};
Of course, Liliroon bring lots and lots of karakul wagons for yooo later.${prompt};
!${prompt};
You'll give me karakul wagons? Lots and lots of 'em?${prompt};
It trooo.${prompt};
Ah...${prompt};
Just leave it to us! Our detective agency will...${prompt};
Um, I am afraid that you are mistaken. You see, we are actually a mercenary company. Our job is to carry out the will of the Empress.${prompt};
I am terribly sorry, but we cannot accept requests from the city's general popu--${prompt};
Urk!${prompt};
Ahem... Where was I again?${prompt};
Oh yes. Our detective agency will...${prompt};
...Abquhbah!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
...Wh-what is it?${prompt};
Prepare to recite our company motto and the promise we give to our valued customers!${prompt};
Um...ummm...;
W-we feature speedy investigations and low prices! And of course, your personal information is safe with us!${prompt};
Whatever your worry, our experienced and able staff will solve it!${prompt};
Ain't it the truth.${prompt};
Liliroon so glad to find someone reliable to help.${prompt};
Now, whatever have you come to us for today, ma'am?${prompt};
Liliroon is loooking for someone.${prompt};
Actually, Liliroon is perfooom maker.${prompt};
Perfooom?;
Ah, you mean to say that you'rrre a perfumier?${prompt};
If that mean perfooom maker, that right. Liliroon make nice smell for nose. Can no see perfooom with eye.${prompt};
Liliroon had to wooork very, very hard in beginning.${prompt};
But Liliroon was able to make company, company that sell very nice perfooom.${prompt};
Hm. How very interesting...${prompt};
(Hey, could that be Vevuce? That's the brand that President Naja always wears when she's got to look her best!)${prompt};
(I've heard that the head of the company and the most skilled perfumier was a Qiqirn...)${prompt};
Rrreally!?${prompt};
Hm?;
Yes, of course it trooo...${prompt};
Ah, sorry 'bout that. Don't mind yourself with our little rrramblings. Go on with your story.${prompt};
Well...there was someone whooo help Liliroon when just starting out... He is genius, a real gooorooo! Liliroon want thank that person.${prompt};
A goo-what?${prompt};
(...I think she said “guru”... Her teacher, maybe?)${prompt};
It thanks to that person that even little Qiqirn are perfooom makers now, lots and lots of them!${prompt};
But it been many years since Liliroon left here, yooo know?${prompt};
Liliroon's gooorooo and Liliroon's friends...where cooould they be now?${prompt};
I see.;
I think I've got a pretty good grrrasp of what you're asking for.${prompt};
Now, we can't have just any chump dealin' with someone connected to the Empress...${prompt};
Corporal ${name-player}!${prompt};
Cooorporal?${prompt};
Errr...I mean, Detective ${name-player}!${prompt};
This is our top detective! ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] solved thousands of difficult cases!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He'll/She'll] be your eyes, your ears, the lamp that lights your path! ${choice-player-gender}[He'll/She'll] find this person you're looking for!${prompt};
You can use ${choice-player-gender}['im/'er] however ya see fit!${prompt};
(And rrremember, ya better not let it spill that we're not a detective agency, got it!?)${prompt};
(Or I'll hitch ya rrright up to the wagons with the karakuls!)${prompt};
Well, go on and solve your case now, Detective ${name-player}! Off with ya!${prompt};
Yooo probably need some kind of hint before start, right?${prompt};
Yooo want know something about Liliroon's gooorooo?${prompt};
What yooo want to know?;
${selection-lines};
Looks.;
Personality.;
Scent.${prompt};
He is Elvaan man. Maybe very old?${prompt};
But very active for old man. Sometime hard to believe he so old.${prompt};
He must have lots and lots of years nooow. Liliroon kind of wooorry...${prompt};
Yooo want know what he doing now?${prompt};
Probably doing research on very nice perfooom, no?${prompt};
Very very very veeery!${prompt};
Very strict person! Always get mad at pooor Liliroon.${prompt};
Liliroon was not good perfooom maker, so heard angry voice much.${prompt};
Liliroon have no parent, but think of him like father, yooo know?${prompt};
That what fathers do, no? Strict with kid, right?${prompt};
Oooh yes, his smell...${prompt};
He always wooorking with perfoooms, so smell very nice, like flower.${prompt};
When he walk, always follooow by scent trail.${prompt};
Oh, yes!;
Speaking of scent, this is perfooom he made.${prompt};
${color-alt: 208}The perfume has a very pleasant scent, like that of fresh flowers.${prompt};
Liliroon thought maybe if brought perfooom it help find him.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
If yooo smell this scent, yooo should follow it.${prompt};
So, where should start, Detective?${prompt};
Any idea...?;
${selection-lines};
Balrahn Way?;
Wajaom Woodlands?;
Halvung?${prompt};
Oooh, Liliroon was right. Detective always know best. Let go there!${prompt};
Balrahn Way have so much peoples. Must also have much smells, right?${prompt};
But Liliroon hear there are monsters there...${prompt};
Monsters eat small peoples like me, no?${prompt};
Maybe Liliroon wrong, but think Halvooong is capital for many monsters, no?${prompt};
Gooorooo can do many great thing, but Liliroon no think he mooove to place with vicious monsters...${prompt};
Oooh?;
Liliroon get different feeling...oh well?${prompt};
Hmmm?${prompt};
Hm hmmm hmmmmmm?${prompt};
There many smells here...could be his scent, or maybe not?${prompt};
Hey, what're you doing over there? Hm? A Tarutaru...?${prompt};
This person has his smell...hmmm?${prompt};
Ah, a Qiqirn...${prompt};
What's the matter?${prompt};
Oh, Liliroon sorry...ummm...${prompt};
Are you lost?${prompt};
No! Of cooourse not. Liliroon is not child!${prompt};
Sure, kid. That's what all children say.${prompt};
Okay then, what is a “grownup” like you doing loitering around Balrahn Way? Or is it something you can't tell me here?${prompt};
What that supposed mean? Yooo very roood!${prompt};
If you're not guilty, then why are you getting so worked up?${prompt};
Very suspicious...;
I'm going to have to bring you in for some questions, okay? Come along quietly, now...${prompt};
Yooo making me very very mad! Want talk to yooo no more!${prompt};
Hey! Come back here!;
Nooo!;
Aaah! Go away!${prompt};
${name-player}, help!${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Help her out.;
Watch her run. Haha!${prompt};
${name-player}!;
Oooh please, ${name-player}!${prompt};
What do you want? Don't get in my way! This is none of your business.${prompt};
...Wait. It was you she was asking for help a second ago, wasn't it?${prompt};
Are you this child's guardian?${prompt};
Well, then... I'll need to see some form of identification.${prompt};
Show him some I.D.?;
${selection-lines};
Show your mercenary badge.;
I'm not showing you anything!${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} gleams brightly!;
That badge...${prompt};
That's from that despicable mercenary compa--ah, sorry. That was most discourteous of me.${prompt};
So she's one of Salaheem Sentinels' customers?${prompt};
No. Liliroon is customer of detective agency!${prompt};
What's this? President Naja's trying her hand at detective work too, is she?${prompt};
In any case, you must forgive our discourtesies. Please don't say anything to Naja...${prompt};
I know how I can make it up to you. You were looking for something, weren't you?${prompt};
Due to the nature of my work, I am quite familiar with this area. Maybe I can help.${prompt};
I see...so you are looking for your former instructor...${prompt};
Yes. He smell same as yooo.${prompt};
But I've never worn any fragrances...not my thing, really.${prompt};
Can yooo think of any reason yooo would have his smell?${prompt};
No... I have no idea why I would smell like your teacher...${prompt};
What have I been doing that could have made his scent rub off on me?${prompt};
Liliroon frustrated...${prompt};
Detective, ask question and help remember!${prompt};
What will you ask?;
${selection-lines};
Where have you been?;
What have you eaten?;
Who have you met?${prompt};
Well, let's see... Today during my break, I was enjoying a sis kebabi dripping with juice, and...${prompt};
Oooh. And then?${prompt};
I went to the Shararat Teahouse and had the sweetest helvasi you can imagine...dropped a cube of sugar into some chai, which went great with the helvasi... The aroma was just heavenly...${prompt};
Did that help any?${prompt};
Oooh, yooo making Liliroon hungry...${prompt};
Today, I clocked in to work right after arriving at Port Ephramad. Then I headed out for my patrols on Balrahn Way.${prompt};
Other than that, all I did was stop at the teahouse for a bite. I didn't really meet with anyone other than my co-workers...${prompt};
Hmmm...the port...${prompt};
Where I was...? Ah, maybe that's it!${prompt};
Yooo remember something?${prompt};
Actually, this morning I just came back from a trip to Nashmau.${prompt};
My co-workers wondered why on Urhguum I'd go there for my vacation.${prompt};
To tell the truth, I envied the adventurers that have been visiting our town lately...${prompt};
I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I thought that visiting Nashmau would give me a little taste of what it'd be like to be an adventurer.${prompt};
To be realistic, though, lately a lot of adventurers are being worked like dogs by that brutal mercenary company. That doesn't sound like that much fun...${prompt};
Ah, my apologies. That was most discourteous.${prompt};
No wooorry. Liliroon want hear mooore...${prompt};
Anyway, when I left Nashmau, the Qiqirn surrounded me.${prompt};
Apparently they had a Hume friend, but he returned to Al Zahbi not long ago and they seemed to miss people's companionship.${prompt};
I bet I got your teacher's scent rubbed off on me from one of the Qiqirns who came to see me off.${prompt};
Nashmau? Okay, thank yooo!${prompt};
Detective ${name-player}, let's go Nashmau!${prompt};
Ah, maybe that's it! I just came in on a ship from Nashmau.${prompt};
So how'd it go?${prompt};
${name-player} solved case... Thank yooo very much. Did very goood work.${prompt};
I am honored by your compliment. Our detective agency values the customer above all else.${prompt};
Anyway, about those karakul--err, your token of thanks...?${prompt};
No yooo worry. They sooon arrive.${prompt};
President Liliroon!${prompt};
Why have you come to Salaheem's Sentinels, of all places?${prompt};
Sentinels...?${prompt};
Yipe!${prompt};
I have brought the payment as you requested, but everyone knows this is a mercenary company, not a detective agency!${prompt};
Liliroon just ask this detective to help find someone...${prompt};
You're the president of this company, aren't you? Just what are you trying to pull?${prompt};
Why, whatever are you talking about...?${prompt};
Pretending to be a detective agency even though you're a mercenary company... That's fraud, plain and simple!${prompt};
Frrraud?${prompt};
You dare accuse me of fraud?${prompt};
Yes! You operated under a false company name. What else could you call that!?${prompt};
We don't need seedy companies like yours in Aht Urhgan...${prompt};
I don't know what you're talking about. We serve the will of the Empress and operate under her perrrsonal sanction!${prompt};
I swear by the name of the Empress...we would never engage in any questionable business!${prompt};
Well then, I wonder if your shining reputation would suffer any if this fraud were exposed?${prompt};
...Oh?;
You wanna take this outside, buster?${prompt};
I refuse.;
I would rather settle this in court!${prompt};
Ohoho...and this affects me how? Do ya rrreally think you'll be allowed to survive in this town after pittin' yourself up against Salaheem's Sentinels?${prompt};
Both of yooo, be quiet!!!${prompt};
Liliroon realize this not detective agency long ago.${prompt};
But Liliroon not care.${prompt};
President Liliroon, how could you not...?${prompt};
Liliroon learn much about teacher...${prompt};
Perfooom is best made when thinking of all people's joy when they smell fragrance. Yooo must think how happy it will make them.${prompt};
Not just perfooom making. All work like that.${prompt};
${name-player} work very hard for Liliroon.${prompt};
And Liliroon is very happy...${prompt};
That enough, don't yooo think?${prompt};
And Liliroon felt same from ${name-player}.${prompt};
Liliroon think...${prompt};
...that happiness come because President Naja train employee well.${prompt};
Eh?;
Well...heheh...${prompt};
Liliroon learn a lot from her. Yooo agree?${prompt};
Of...of course...${prompt};
But ${name-player} also wooork very well.${prompt};
Must have very high rank in company, no?${prompt};
Ah...well...yes.${prompt};
It hasn't been too long since ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] joined our company, but ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] proved ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] stuff time and time again, rising all the way to the rank of cor--${prompt};
Errr, sergeant.;
Isn't that right, Sergeant ${name-player}?${prompt};
Oooh, President Naja have very good eye for talent.${prompt};
Ohoho, you are too kind.${prompt};
Of cooourse, Liliroon keep promise and pay reward.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am.;
It will be as you say.${prompt};
Many thanks.♪${prompt};
And yooo, ${name-player}. Liliroon really appreciate yooo.${prompt};
(Pssst...${name-player}...)${prompt};
(Liliroon not want to say this tooo loud, but...)${prompt};
(If yooo ever get fired from Salaheem's Sentinels...)${prompt};
(Yooo welcome at my company!)${prompt};
(And Liliroon pay yooo three times the salary.)${prompt};
Gooodbye, everyone...${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Sergeant!${prompt};
So how's it comin' along with that Qiqirn?${prompt};
Ya better treat her like a queen if I'm to get my karakul wagons!${prompt};
Ahem! <Cough, cough>.${prompt};
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi.${prompt};
Lalala-lala-lala.♪${prompt};
Ah! I was just doing some vocal exercises!;
(How very embarrassing!)${prompt};
I am Fari-Wari the Eloquent (and never Long-Winded), a humble bard and all-round entertainer.${prompt};
To discover inspiration for new compositions, I am traveling this turbulent world in search of heroic tales that ignite the blood and stir the soul.${prompt};
However, it pains me to realize I have heard the epics of the West twice, and in some cases thrice, over.;
And thus, gentle listener, I braved the ocean deep and wide to arrive here in this land of untold stories.${prompt};
Your relaxed poise and posture lead me to believe you have some familiarity with our location.${prompt};
Perhaps our meeting was told in the stars, or at least in the tea leaves of some cup drained in this very establishment.${prompt};
What say you?;
Will you consent to become my attendant, my Man Firesday, my guiding light in the darkness?${prompt};
Become his attendant?;
${selection-lines};
Sure...;
Attendant?${prompt};
As my attendant, your duties will include...${prompt};
...showing me around town, handling my shopping, restraining overly enthusiastic fans, keeping my dressing room supplied with sweets...${prompt};
...helping me overcome writing blocks--all manner of tasks that allow me to concentrate on my art.;
It truly is a glamorous position!${prompt};
Wonderful! My prospective attendants usually put up much more of a fight!${prompt};
Your first assignment will be to aid me as I interview the citizens of this town in search of heroic inspiration!${prompt};
Now, who to choose to become my muse...?${prompt};
Let's see now...;
Hmmm, how about that severe-looking lass in the uniform?${prompt};
Greetings, my Imperial rose.${prompt};
Excuse me?${prompt};
May I impose on your solitude, sweet damsel?;
Perhaps we could share a pot of cha--?${prompt};
How dare you speak to me in such a casual manner!?;
I am Biyaada, the senior adjutant to Skyserpent General Rughadjeen!${prompt};
My most humble apologies.;
I was hopelessly enchanted by your swanlike elegance, and...${prompt};
...what was that name you just mentioned?${prompt};
I am Biyaada.${prompt};
No no, the one after that.${prompt};
You speak of General Rughadjeen?${prompt};
Yes, that's the one.;
Would this general happen to be a personage of some fame and importance?;
I am but barely arrived in this nation, and have little--${prompt};
Even a recent visitor to our city should know of the great General Rughadjeen!${prompt};
He is the guardian of Al Zahbi, the commander of the Serpent Generals, and a decorated hero!${prompt};
Oho!;
And I assume he is as fierce as a raptor, and as courageous as a lion?${prompt};
The perfect warrior!${prompt};
Might I presume upon you to regale me with his tale?${prompt};
I am not some dusty historian, mind you.;
I am a bard of some renown--composing flattering odes to heroes as I wander this world of wonders.${prompt};
A bard? Then General Rughadjeen's valiant deeds would be immortalized in verse...${prompt};
But, I have no time for this daydreaming!${prompt};
!?${prompt};
Calm down, my dear.;
I'm sure I can deal with whatever it is that troubles you!${prompt};
I don't recall asking for your help.;
And what do you think a tiny thing like you could do in any case?${prompt};
Well, I may be somewhat lacking in physical prowess...${prompt};
...but my attendant here has no such deficiencies!${prompt};
A mercenary, are you?${prompt};
Hmm, well, I suppose you would have some experience with staring death in the face...${prompt};
Exactly!;
Why, my attendant is worth a thousand soldiers! ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] skill in battle is unmatched by--${prompt};
Do you think I might have a word with this attendant of yours?${prompt};
Of course, of course!;
Stand up straight! Eyes front! Ears open!${prompt};
Listen to Biyaada?;
${selection-lines};
I had a choice...?;
I don't think so...${prompt};
It concerns General Rughadjeen...${prompt};
He has been commanding the defenses of the city in an almost endless battle to stem the constant waves of beastman assaults.${prompt};
One can only imagine the level of exhaustion he must be feeling.${prompt};
Just the other day, General Rughadjeen was on the front lines, leading our soldiers in an effort to repel the invading Troll Mercenaries.${prompt};
In the heat of combat, he dropped something very dear to him.${prompt};
An instant of inattention was all it took...${prompt};
I suspect that one of the enemy mercenaries snatched up this precious item before retreating to Halvung.${prompt};
The Trolls are known to claim such trophies from our soldiers in order to inflate their stories of conquest.${prompt};
The general has continued to fulfill his duties as if nothing were amiss, but...${prompt};
I work side by side with him every day. I see the sadness that he attempts to hide.${prompt};
If I could, I would track down this keepsake myself.${prompt};
But abandoning my post without leave would cause even further grief for my commander.;
An enlisted soldier such as me has little freedom...${prompt};
That is why I would ask your aid.${prompt};
I need someone to travel to the Troll stronghold of Halvung and retrieve what General Rughadjeen has lost.${prompt};
This is your great worry!? Why, nothing could be simpler!${prompt};
My attendant here will stalk into Halvung on the silent paws of a panther, and seek this lost treasure with the unblinking eyes of a hawk!${prompt};
And when you have the treasure in your possession, perhaps you will consent to tell me the tale of this mighty general?${prompt};
If you do this thing, I promise to tell you all that I know.${prompt};
From what I can catch from the general's murmurings, the item is some sort of cloth...${prompt};
Cloth! Yes!;
Attendant! No time for dilly-dallying!;
Off to Halvung with you!${prompt};
For the protector of Al Zahbi!;
To ease the mind of this fair maiden!;
But mostly...${prompt};
To allow me to compose the greatest ballad this world has ever known!${prompt};
Have you found the item we spoke of?${prompt};
I'm sorry, but I'm on duty.;
We will talk later at the teahouse.${prompt};
There's no time for dilly-dallying!;
Off to Halvung with you!${prompt};
The potential creation of the greatest masterpiece of prose this century has seen hangs in the balance!${prompt};
You found something!?${prompt};
Yes...that ribbon...;
I have often seen the general gazing contentedly at that strip of cloth.${prompt};
Thank you.;
This must be the item he dropped.${prompt};
Did I not tell you?;
You could expect nothing less from an attendant to Fari-Wari the Eloquent!${prompt};
So it seems.;
I believe I owe you a tale, then.${prompt};
It was the events of a single night that would change General Rughadjeen's fate forever...${prompt};
Almost two years ago now, the western arm of the Imperial Army was under the sole command of General Missahd, a member of the royal family.${prompt};
Assigned to this general was one Captain Rughadjeen...${prompt};
Hmph. I see.;
I will pass your proposal on to the Operations Staff for due consideration.${prompt};
There is no time for that!;
There are signs that the beastmen are massing for a full-scale assault!;
We cannot wait for reinforcements!${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Captain, have you seen the fortifications on the Balrahn Defense Line?;
And the number of our soldiers that man those walls?${prompt};
Our enemies are nothing more than mindless beasts that will break themselves against our stalwart defenses. It matters not how many pigs come to the slaughter.${prompt};
...${prompt};
At the very least...${prompt};
Will you allow me to lead a heavy infantry unit in a surprise attack on the enemy stronghold?${prompt};
...${prompt};
We will approach under the cover of darkness this very night and blunt their desire for battle.${prompt};
We will break the spine of this newly formed army before it even begins to move.${prompt};
If all goes well, we will sow chaos among their disorderly ranks, and buy time to bolster our defenses.${prompt};
Captain Rughadjeen...${prompt};
The beastmen forces are focused and eager for blood.${prompt};
If we allow them to reach the capital with an organized army, they will break through any holes in the line and rain destruction on the lightly defended city streets ...${prompt};
Rughadjeen!${prompt};
...Sir.${prompt};
You speak above your station.;
I don't have time to listen to a lowly captain with delusions of strategic brilliance.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I will not stand for this disrespectful attitude.;
From this day forth, you are relieved from the position of captain.${prompt};
Wha--!?${prompt};
After receiving the punishment of ten lashes for disrespecting a senior officer, you are to return to your unit and follow the orders of the newly appointed captain.${prompt};
...Sir.${prompt};
Hmph.;
A simple captain attempting to lecture me on strategy...${prompt};
An attack?;
Where are they!?${prompt};
The West Gate!${prompt};
What befalls!?${prompt};
Captain Rughadjeen!;
It's absolute chaos!${prompt};
The Balrahn Defense Line has been breached...${prompt};
And the capital is surrounded by an army of Troll Mercenaries!${prompt};
Surrounded!?${prompt};
The savages have brought siege weapons.;
It won't be long before the streets are swarming with them...${prompt};
What of the soldiers along the defense line?;
An army of that size could not have been swept aside so easily.${prompt};
The defense forces are engaged with a horde of Mamool Ja that arrived on the heels of the Trolls.${prompt};
Then we are too late...${prompt};
The beastmen have outmaneuvered us...${prompt};
Our unit is forming up as we speak.${prompt};
What are your orders, Captain?${prompt};
Forgive me...${prompt};
Captain?${prompt};
General Missahd just relieved me of my post.;
I have no authority...${prompt};
Isn't that the general over there...?${prompt};
!?${prompt};
Why is he running that way? The front line is...;
Surely he doesn't intend to abandon the citizens to their fate?${prompt};
I shall assume temporary command of our forces.${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
Ready arms!;
Form ranks!${prompt};
This will be a bloodbath...${prompt};
Hold ranks!${prompt};
The enemy is just as exhausted as you.${prompt};
If we can hold but a few moments more, they will break.;
This battle is ours!${prompt};
Let them tire themselves destroying our buildings--it will help prevent the spread of fires.${prompt};
Your main objective is the safety of our citizens.;
The future of this city rests on your shoulders!${prompt};
For Al Zahbi!${prompt};
!?${prompt};
You! You can't go that way!${prompt};
You'll get yourself killed!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Sajalda, take command of the troops.${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
Aphmau...;
It's worse than we heard.;
Look!${prompt};
She didn't get out in time...${prompt};
Ovjang?${prompt};
Okay.${prompt};
Follow me!${prompt};
Hey!;
Stay where you are!${prompt};
You can't...!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Dammit!${prompt};
You!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Where's the girl?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Please wake up...${prompt};
Ngh...${prompt};
She'll be fine.;
Just a bump to the head.${prompt};
Ngh...;
<Cough...cough>.${prompt};
You're safe now.;
Can you sit up?${prompt};
She is...unharmed...?${prompt};
I'm so glad...${prompt};
You...rescued us?${prompt};
Yes.${prompt};
Our thanks...${prompt};
Reckless child.;
You could've been killed!${prompt};
But I commend you on your bravery...${prompt};
Please...;S'il te plaît...
You must go now...${prompt};
What?${prompt};
We'll be fine...;
You must return...${prompt};
There are still many...who need your help...${prompt};
So go...and help them...${prompt};
I can't just leave two children--${prompt};
Lady Aphmau!${prompt};
Thank Walahra!;
Are you injured!?${prompt};
I'm fine.${prompt};
Well, that's good to...${prompt};
No, this is terrible!;
What if something happened to you!?;
You must be more careful!${prompt};
I am sorry...${prompt};
(You worry too much, Rishfee.)${prompt};
Lady Aphmau, who is that person?${prompt};
He risked his own life to...${prompt};
Wait!${prompt};
Your arm...;
You're bleeding!${prompt};
This scratch? It's nothing.${prompt};
It looks bad.;
You shouldn't ignore your injuries!${prompt};
Here...;
Thank you...${prompt};
Would...would you tell me your name?${prompt};
I am Rughadjeen.;
...A soldier in the Imperial Army.${prompt};
Rughadjeen then returned to the front line, gathering the scattered soldiers to him as he leaped into the fray...${prompt};
The Troll and Mamool Ja armies were beaten back by the invigorated defense, and the capital was saved from destruction.${prompt};
The words of that young lady had instilled him with heroic valor!${prompt};
It may be as you say.${prompt};
And then?;
I assume the valiant Rughadjeen was handsomely rewarded for his deeds?${prompt};
Despite the desperate circumstances, Rughadjeen's actions overstepped the bounds of his authority.;
The military is unforgiving when it comes to such transgressions.${prompt};
Unbelievable!;
Surely that nasty General Missahd interfered in the proceedings!?${prompt};
Who can say?;
The result was that Rughadjeen was confined to the barracks--a punishment he accepted without a single word of protest.${prompt};
How tragic!;
Are the fates so cruel!?${prompt};
Then one day, a messenger arrived with a summons to the Imperial Palace.${prompt};
Huzzah!${prompt};
He was to have an audience with Her Magnificence?${prompt};
Wh-what became of Rughadjeen!?${prompt};
Well, you see...ah.;
My break time is over.;
I must return to my post.${prompt};
Nooo!${prompt};
I'm sorry, but we must continue this another time.${prompt};
Until then.${prompt};
Biyaada! How can you torture me so!?;
Ah...${prompt};
I'm on duty.${prompt};
(Wait at the teahouse. I'll make my way there once my shift is over.)${prompt};
Ah, the anticipation has me tingling down to my toes!${prompt};
What befell bold Rughadjeen when he arrived at the palace?;
Biyaada, where are you...?${prompt};
Aha, my loyal attendant!;
Excellent timing!${prompt};
I've had word that Biyaada will soon be here to conclude her tale!${prompt};
Ah, I see you've been waiting.${prompt};
Waiting!?;
Why must the sun crawl through the sky at such a leisurely pace!?;
The story, my dear, the story!${prompt};
Yes, the story...;
Where was I...?${prompt};
Such cruelty!;
Our hero was about to meet the Empress, as the audience turns blue holding its collective breath!${prompt};
That's where you were!${prompt};
Oh? The Empress?${prompt};
Ah yes, the Empress addresses...${prompt};
Rughadjeen.;
Word of your valor on the field of battle has reached the palace...${prompt};
Your Magnificence is too kind.${prompt};
You have been confined to the barracks until now...?${prompt};
Yes, Grand Vizier...${prompt};
You have been done a great disservice.${prompt};
Your Magnificence need not apologize...${prompt};
Rughadjeen.;
Do you know why Her Magnificence is aware of your deeds?${prompt};
I am sure I do not--${prompt};
You are beloved by the soldiers.;
The palace has been inundated with requests for your release.${prompt};
We sympathize with their outrage.;
You are a mighty warrior that has protected the capital and her people, including--${prompt};
Your Magnificence...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Rughadjeen.;
In recognition of your heroics, you are hereby appointed to the position of Skyserpent General.${prompt};
!?${prompt};
I assume you understand the implications of this title?${prompt};
...Sir.${prompt};
For the Empire's time of greatest need, Emperor Ulthalam created a title that conferred ultimate authority on the bearer in matters of national defense.${prompt};
It is our wish that you devote your life to the defense of the Empire...${prompt};
I am honored beyond words.;
I swear to uphold this duty until the last drop of blood spills from my veins.${prompt};
We have faith in your commitment.${prompt};
The blade is a gift from Her Magnificence.${prompt};
It is a national treasure, said to have been wielded by the great hero Balrahn himself.${prompt};
We believe you will prove a fitting master...${prompt};
You offer me the algol?;
I am speechless...${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Are you ready for your first duty as Skyserpent General?${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
As you are aware, the Empire stands on the brink of unprecedented peril, beset by enemies from both the east and the west...${prompt};
This nation needs talented commanders, without concern for lineage or station.${prompt};
It falls to you to gather such leaders, to stand against the coming storm.${prompt};
Understood.${prompt};
I will seek out the most valiant warriors of Aht Urhgan and judge their quality with my own eyes.${prompt};
We have faith you will not fail us...${prompt};
Our mighty Skyserpent General...${prompt};
And thus Rughadjeen became the Skyserpent General and the protector of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Wonderful!;
So that is the tale of how such a young man came to hold such a heavy responsibility.${prompt};
How does the story continue?;
When does he meet the other Serpent Generals?${prompt};
After confirming that the Trolls and Mamool Ja were too weak to mount another offensive, General Rughadjeen set off to the east...${prompt};
For some time, the Imperial Army had underestimated the strength of the beastmen in the west, and positioned the great bulk of its forces along the eastern front.${prompt};
General Rughadjeen hoped to bolster the western army by drawing on seasoned troops from these eastern forces.${prompt};
And that is when he encountered the first of his recruits...${prompt};
Haha!;
Burn! Burn! Burn!;
<Pant...pant>...;
Dammit!;Bon sang !
Someone's been busy with the egg laying!${prompt};
General Gadalar's brigade had fallen into an enemy ambush.${prompt};
And he was single-handedly occupying the Yagudo to give his troops a chance to escape...${prompt};
Muhahaha...;
That should be enough of you to fuel a decent blaze!${prompt};
Firaga!;
Phew...;
Been a while since the rank and file gave me so much trouble...${prompt};
...?${prompt};
Who goes there?${prompt};
I am an ally from the western capital!;
I came when I heard of your plight...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hehehe...;
Hahahahaha!${prompt};
I don't...?${prompt};
Why do my enemies...${prompt};
...all try the same trick!?${prompt};
Biyaada!${prompt};
S-sir!${prompt};
There is no time for chai and sweetmeats.;
There are reports of Mamool Ja scouts in the city.${prompt};
In the city!?${prompt};
Whoa!;Ouah !
You...you're General Rughadjeen!${prompt};
You're even more dashing and noble than I imagined!;
A fine hero if ever there was one!${prompt};
You must allow me to immortalize you in verse!;
How does “Saga of the Skyserpent” sound for a title?${prompt};
Who...who is this gentleman?${prompt};
Biyaada, were you telling stories about me?${prompt};
My apologies, sir.${prompt};
But it was this man's attendant that found your--${prompt};
Ah, that was you two?;
Then it is I who must apologize...${prompt};
Nothing to apologize for!;
Scrambling up the steep crags of Halvung, battling through a small army of vicious Trolls, facing certain death...${prompt};
These things are of no consequence.;
Hardly worthy of gratitude.${prompt};
That day I saw true courage and compassion...${prompt};
And every day now, even in the thick of battle, one glance at this ribbon reminds me of those things...the things I fight to protect.${prompt};
Will you give me the honor of your name?${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
I thank you.${prompt};
Ahem...${prompt};
And you too, of course, my splendid bard.${prompt};
I am honored to fight shoulder to shoulder with such courageous mercenaries.${prompt};
A bard must be prepared to dazzle with a finely tuned voice at a moment's notice!${prompt};
The wonderful chai of this establishment helps to soothe my throat during extended bouts of vocal exercises.${prompt};
It is long past time Biyaada arrived at the teahouse.${prompt};
Could there have been some thrilling military crisis...?${prompt};
Lalala～.;
The protectors of the people～.;
Five serpents and their armored coils～.♪${prompt};
Yes!;
This epic will write itself!;
I can almost hear the thunderous accolades!${prompt};
And then what happened?${prompt};
Well, my dear...${prompt};
I ducked and weaved a deadly dance among those hulking brutes, and when my flashing blade finally stilled, I was left standing before a small mountain of stinking Troll corpses.${prompt};
Wow! You're amazing, Mister Fari-Wari!${prompt};
Not only do you compose stirring ballads, but you yourself could play the part of the hero!${prompt};
Now, now, you'll make me blush...${prompt};
Tell us more!;
Did you brave the terrors of Halvung all alone?${prompt};
Why, of course.;
Well, my attendant ${name-player} was there...${prompt};
But I may as well have been alone.${prompt};
That bumbling attendant of mine was constantly losing ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] way, and even tried walking up to a Troll to ask directions!;
Such an adorable fool.${prompt};
Ahahaha!${prompt};
But with my extensive combat training from the Order of Militant Bards, a score or more smelly beastmen is nothing I can't handle.${prompt};
And ${name-player} was most contrite and apologetic once I'd saved ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] skin from an unfortunate flaying.;
${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] expression was really quite priceless...${prompt};
Allow me to recreate the scene...${prompt};
Hm...? Oh!${prompt};
When did you get here!?${prompt};
Mister Fari-Wari, who is this person?${prompt};
Um...well...yes...;
This is the attendant I mentioned...${prompt};
Oh! The one who brought the Trolls down on you...${prompt};
The adorable fool who you saved from an unfortunate flaying?${prompt};
Ah! Let's not be so...!${prompt};
?${prompt};
I...that is to say...${prompt};
${color-alt: 208}Fari-Wari looks at you with pleading eyes.;
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
That's not how I remember it.;
Who's in danger of a flaying?${prompt};
I...hehe...oh dear...${prompt};
My most humble apologies, my dears, but it seems Fari-Wari the Eloquent must return to his quill and parchment.;
I shall regale you with heroic tales another time...${prompt};
Awww...${prompt};
No more stories?${prompt};
Ahem.;
Please excuse an entertainer's proclivity for embellishment.${prompt};
Who were those ladies, you ask?${prompt};
Ah, do you recall my recently penned epic “Saga of the Skyserpent”?;
It's been rather well received by the locals...${prompt};
Wherever I go, I'm surrounded by legions of Fari-Wari fans.${prompt};
I've even had one enthusiastic Mithran child peeking into my room at night...from the third-floor window, no less!${prompt};
And there's also a Hume lady whose aim, it seems, is to keep my mailbox full to bursting with an endless stream of love letters.${prompt};
But a bard's life is more than just basking in the accolades of countless admirers.${prompt};
No, a minstrel may not rest on his laurels when there are sequels to be scribbled.${prompt};
That's right, Fari-Wari is once again dipping his quill into the ink of inspiration!${prompt};
I have already begun laying the groundwork for the next chapter in my saga.${prompt};
Do you remember the lovely Biyaada, senior adjutant to Skyserpent General Rughadjeen?${prompt};
She has promised to be my muse, and relate the continuation of her Serpent Generals story.${prompt};
Is it not perfect?${prompt};
That small gathering of fans was nothing more than a coincidence.${prompt};
In truth, I am here to meet Biyaada as soon as her shift on the wall is over.${prompt};
I'm sure you would love to hear the rest of the tale, yes?${prompt};
Oh, that piercing gaze!;
Not to worry, I'll not be sending you off to fight fiends in foul fortresses this time around.${prompt};
And speaking of the lady herself...${prompt};
Come now, ${name-player}.;
Feel free to join me in this moment of literary history.;
And by “free,” I mean your presence won't be paid for.${prompt};
Ah, the breathtaking Biyaada!;
It seems a thousand winters have frozen my heart since last I gazed upon the warmth of your smile!${prompt};
Ah...I'm sorry to keep you waiting.${prompt};
Hello, aren't you the mercenary I met last time?;
${name-player}, wasn't it?${prompt};
It is good to see you are well.${prompt};
General Rughadjeen commends you on your bravery.${prompt};
Why, that was but a trifle!${prompt};
Fari-Wari here has not stopped hounding me for information about the other Serpent Generals.${prompt};
I am not disinclined to cooperate...${prompt};
Especially if such a work would spread the fame and glory of the Skyserpent General.${prompt};
Exactly, exactly!${prompt};
Now, where would you like me to start?${prompt};
Why, where you left off, my dear!${prompt};
And where was that again?${prompt};
Such insensitivity!;
General Rughadjeen had just encountered Gadalar on the eastern front...${prompt};
Ah, now I remember.;
I think I can pick up the tale.${prompt};
The Skyserpent General had found his first recruit...${prompt};
Damn you, Rughadjeen!;
I thought I told you to stay out of my way!${prompt};
I can handle these pawns!${prompt};
Perhaps.${prompt};
General Gadalar.;
Too often you place yourself in danger to shield your troops from harm...${prompt};
Shield my...!?${prompt};
You should place more trust in your men.;
They will fight all the more ferociously when allowed to stand alongside their general.${prompt};
Hmph.;
A nice theory!${prompt};
And you could unleash the full fury of your fiery incantations if I held the enemy at a distance with my blade.${prompt};
Bah, do as you wish.${prompt};
Don't blame me when your eyebrows are singed off by my Salamander Flame.${prompt};
Ha, I'll take my chances.${prompt};
In this way, General Rughadjeen sought out the nation's mightiest heroes and brought them here to serve in the capital.${prompt};
Including the Skyserpent himself, these heroes are five in number.${prompt};
The same number of serpents said to serve Zahak, the symbol of Aht Urhgan...${prompt};
The legend of these servants gave rise to their collective title:${prompt};
The Serpent Generals.${prompt};
And that's how the story ends.${prompt};
Wh-what!?;
That's the end!?${prompt};
That's all?${prompt};
Is there a problem?${prompt};
A problem? This is a travesty!;
You've skipped over all the vital elements in the tale!${prompt};
Vital elements?${prompt};
Hm? You know, the friendships and the falling outs, the anger and the passion...everything that makes a story worth hearing!${prompt};
I don't know that it was all that dramatic...${prompt};
You see what I'm getting at, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Do you get it?;
${selection-lines};
Oh, absolutely.;
I get that I want to hear more.${prompt};
You need more detail, is that it?;
I'm afraid I don't know too much about the actual formation of the Serpent Generals.${prompt};
You want to hear more?;
I'm afraid I don't know much about any of the generals besides General Rughadjeen.${prompt};
You don't know!?${prompt};
Well, I am an adjutant to Skyserpent General Rughadjeen.;
I can't be expected to have intimate knowledge of...${prompt};
Of course!${prompt};
Why don't you speak with the generals themselves?${prompt};
Speak with the generals!?${prompt};
I'd be happy to make the introductions.${prompt};
I really don't think that will help...${prompt};
Flameserpent General!;
What can you tell me about the formation of the Serpent Generals?${prompt};
Don't call me that...${prompt};
Hm? If I could just hear the Flameserpent General's...${prompt};
I told you not to call me that!;
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...;
And so, I barely lived past my initial greeting...${prompt};
It seems, my dear Biyaada, you are my only safe source of inspiration.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But a bard must risk life and limb to craft a believable tale!${prompt};
Oho...${prompt};
Now whose life and limbs do I risk...?${prompt};
My loyal attendant!${prompt};
You shall loosen the forked tongues of the Serpent Generals, and gather those vital elements in my place!${prompt};
I beg of you!${prompt};
Will you do it?;
${selection-lines};
Life and limbs at your disposal!;
I like my life and limbs where they are...${prompt};
Excellent!;
A fitting response from the attendant to Fari-Wari the Courageous (and seldom Cowardly)!${prompt};
Just a moment.${prompt};
No matter how famous (or infamous) our bard friend is, ${name-player} is only recognized as a simple mercenary.${prompt};
I doubt the generals will make time for idle chit-chat over chai and sutlac...${prompt};
But my saga...${prompt};
There must be something we can do.${prompt};
Some miraculous idea that will open the hearts of the Serpent Generals to my literary excavations...${prompt};
You ask for much...${prompt};
So all is lost?${prompt};
My masterpiece...melting away before me like morning mist...${prompt};
I did not say that it was impossible.${prompt};
I have it!;
If we cannot reach the generals, perhaps their aides would be more accessible?${prompt};
As luck would have it, I'm well acquainted with Gaweesh and Talhaal, the adjutants for the Galeserpent and Stoneserpent Generals.${prompt};
Shall I write you a letter of introduction?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
My sweet savior!;
Your fine favor has my spirits soaring in joyous rapture!${prompt};
Y-you're welcome...?${prompt};
Did you hear, my stalwart attendant?${prompt};
You have free reign to interview the generals' subordinates!${prompt};
Once again, the success of the ballad of the century rests on your steady shoulders!${prompt};
My resourceful attendant!;
I have breathlessly awaited your return!${prompt};
You must tell me all that you have learned!${prompt};
...${prompt};
The Galeserpent General and the Stoneserpent General...${prompt};
I knew it all along!;
My minstrel's instinct could sense a plot dripping with friendships and falling outs, anger and passion!${prompt};
Well, perhaps not all of those, but certainly more drama than our dear Biyaada suspected!${prompt};
Hm.${prompt};
Hmmm!${prompt};
Yes!;
I see it taking shape before me!${prompt};
I see the birth of a truly ageless masterpiece!;
You have shown your worth yet again, my astute attendant!${prompt};
Here is your attendant's fee.${prompt};
A pittance, you say?;
You were just witness to an historical, never-to-be-repeated moment of grand inspiration!;
Some might say I should be charging you!${prompt};
Now, I must put quill to parchment, forthwith!${prompt};
Oh, and ${name-player}?;
Do not stray too far, or too long.;
I foresee the day when I shall have need of your talents once again!${prompt};
What is it, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Now is not the time for dawdling in teahouses, you must--${prompt};
Ah, you're here!${prompt};
I finally managed to find someone to cover my post.${prompt};
???${prompt};
So this is the bard I've heard so much about.${prompt};
He's a lot less...robust...than the rumors make him out to be.;
Well, never mind.${prompt};
You don't need brawn to listen to a good story, and that's what I've got for you today.${prompt};
Oho!${prompt};
You are acquainted with Zazarg, the Stoneserpent General?;
Simply wonderful!${prompt};
Ahem...;
Where are my manners?${prompt};
I am Fari-Wari the Eloquent (and never Long-Winded), composer of heroic sagas and heartrending ballads...${prompt};
Hmph.;
Heroic sagas, hey...?${prompt};
Do you have some grievance with my work?${prompt};
You gotta admit, it's strange.;
I mean, General Rughadjeen is an impressive soldier, but...${prompt};
How can you write a heroic saga and not choose General Zazarg for your primary character?${prompt};
I...well, that is to say...${prompt};
That is a most valid opinion. Most valid!;
Allow me to explain...${prompt};
In order to have the martial might of the Stoneserpent General truly shine, it was necessary to introduce some of the other generals first--for the sake of comparison, you understand.${prompt};
Does this allay your disapproval for my choice of order?${prompt};
I...I suppose.;
So, what do you need to know?${prompt};
Why don't we start with the good general's homeland?${prompt};
His homeland...?${prompt};
Yes, well, is it not unusual for one of the Galkan race to rise to such a lofty position in the Empire?${prompt};
It's not that he tries to hide his origins, but General Zazarg is not a native of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Truly!?;
Yet he holds the title of general?;
Then he is from an Imperial colony, or a protectorate of the Empire?${prompt};
Nothing like that.${prompt};
General Zazarg was born in the Middle Lands nation of Bastok.${prompt};
Bastok!${prompt};
From an Imperial perspective, it is a desolate, inhospitable territory ruled by a wealthy noble class that prizes profits above all else.${prompt};
According to the Stoneserpent General, that image of Bastok is pretty far off the mark.${prompt};
Oho...${prompt};
In his home nation, General Zazarg was once a captain in an elite organization called the “Musketeers”...${prompt};
Greetings, Iron Eater.;
I haven't seen you since that incident down in--${prompt};
Cut the small talk.;
Do you know why I called you here?${prompt};
I'm sure I couldn't tell you.${prompt};
Don't play the fool with me, Zazarg.${prompt};
Oh, you're referring to the Gold Musketeers' little expedition to Palborough?${prompt};
Our nation is entering a new stage of negotiations with the Quadav forces.${prompt};
Now whether that leads us into war or reconciliation, we don't need you and your Gold Musketeers stirring up a hornet's nest.${prompt};
Is that right?${prompt};
Well, it just so happens I had full approval from a Department of Industry official.${prompt};
You can take a look at the mission documents if you want.${prompt};
I know all about that.;
That's why I called you here in person.${prompt};
...${prompt};
There might be a president in office, but both you and I know our nation lacks unity.${prompt};
There is still tension among the races, and the ministries are embroiled in endless power struggles.${prompt};
Politics is for the politicians.;
It's got nothing to do with me, and that's the way I like it.${prompt};
That's where you're wrong.;
If we here in the military don't keep an eye on the trouble in our own government, the future of this nation will be grim.${prompt};
Don't tell me you can't see the corruption of the officials that think nothing of using your troops to turn a profit?${prompt};
Gahahaha!${prompt};
You think this is funny?${prompt};
Of course I know what's going on.;
The Department of Industry will be securing a decent chunk of the budget next year thanks to us.${prompt};
You knew this, and still...${prompt};
Ever since we started operations in the Palborough Mines, who knows how many miners have lost their lives to marauding Quadav?${prompt};
I've seen enough crying children to last me six reincarnations.${prompt};
I'll shake hands with the Shadow Lord himself if it'll give me the chance to smash some turtle men.${prompt};
Zazarg...${prompt};
Iron Eater.${prompt};
We can talk until our teeth fall out, but we'll never see eye to eye.${prompt};
I'm not done with you yet.${prompt};
What's done is done.${prompt};
I'm headed straight from here to the ministry to tender my resignation.${prompt};
Your resignation!?${prompt};
If the commanding officer for an operation quits right after a mission, it'll focus attention on the official that approved the mission in the first place.${prompt};
Once news gets around, people will start looking for reasons why, and then the fun starts.${prompt};
These politicians will be so busy scrambling around trying to save their own necks, they won't have time for scheming and plotting.${prompt};
So, I'm asking you to let me off the hook this time.${prompt};
This can't be the only way.;
We do have constitutional law--we can bring this matter to the courts.${prompt};
There's no need for you to quit.${prompt};
Well, you see...that's not the only reason.${prompt};
After the thrashing we gave the Quadav, they won't be peeking out of their shells for a few years to come.${prompt};
This nation will have peace for a while.;
Old-fashioned soldiers like me will waste away at a desk, filing papers.${prompt};
Not that peace is a bad thing.${prompt};
But I've been a warrior through countless reincarnations.;
The need for battle burns in my blood.${prompt};
There must be somewhere in this wide world of Vana'diel that could use a strong sword arm.${prompt};
So I'm pulling up stakes and heading out to find a place that'll have me.${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Then I won't try to stop you.${prompt};
But Zazarg, if Bastok ever finds itself on the brink of destruction...${prompt};
...you come on home.${prompt};
Nothing like that will ever happen.${prompt};
Not while you're around, anyway.${prompt};
Hmph, don't get sentimental on me.${prompt};
Farewell, Zazarg.${prompt};
Take care of this place, Iron Eater...${prompt};
Captain Zazarg!${prompt};
What's gotten you lot so riled up?${prompt};
There's a rumor going around that has the barracks in an uproar!${prompt};
What kind of rumor?${prompt};
Well...they're saying that you were discharged from service.${prompt};
Sorry, Captain. We should know better than to listen to talk around the fountain.${prompt};
It was probably started by one of the other musketeer units, jealous of our victory in Palborough.${prompt};
Gahahahaha!;
I bet they're thrilled to be rid of me!${prompt};
Right.;
We'll have to head over and teach them to make up stories!${prompt};
Who said it was just a story...?${prompt};
Yeah, more like a bad limerick!;
You'd think that...wait, you're serious!?${prompt};
No!${prompt};
You knew it was coming.;
These squabbling politicians won't have me to kick around anymore.${prompt};
You can't do this to us, Captain!${prompt};
Wh-what are we supposed to do without you!?${prompt};
Give it a break, lads.;
I'm not your pappy.${prompt};
Didn't you go meet with Iron Eater?;
Does he have something to do with this?${prompt};
When have I ever listened to Iron Eater?;
I'm doing this of my own free will.${prompt};
B-but...${prompt};
So it's all final, then?${prompt};
Yes, I'm putting Bastok behind me.${prompt};
But where will you go?${prompt};
Have you heard of “The Silent Empire”?${prompt};
The Near Eastern nation that ignored our cries for aid during the Great War?${prompt};
My grandpappy told me about that place...${prompt};
Well, that's where I'm going.${prompt};
But, Captain!;
There's talk of trouble brewing across the seas...${prompt};
That's why I'm headed there.;
There's sure to be normal citizens getting caught in the middle.${prompt};
And maybe I can save one or two of them from a fate they don't deserve.${prompt};
Sounds like your heart's set on it.;
I better get packing.${prompt};
Me too!${prompt};
Idiots!!!${prompt};
Who's going to look after your families if you come trailing after me?${prompt};
And I want the city to still be standing when I come back to visit!${prompt};
Y-yes, Captain!${prompt};
Understood, Captain...${prompt};
Now that's more like the Gold Musketeer unit I'm proud to have served with!${prompt};
Be well, lads!${prompt};
...;
And so the young Zazarg put the Republic of Bastok behind him...${prompt};
One moment, my good man.;
At the time, there was no mercenary ferry from Mhaura to the port in Al Zahbi...${prompt};
No, there wasn't.;
There was no Salaheem's Sentinels, either.;
Zazarg was recruited by one of the illegal scouting businesses that flourished back then.${prompt};
This black market operation arranged a nighttime airship flight to Aht Urhgan, with Zazarg as its cargo...${prompt};
Why does that all sound so awfully familiar...?${prompt};
I think you know the method I'm talking about, Fari-Rawi.${prompt};
It's “Fari-Wari,” my good man...${prompt};
I'm surprised our famous general made it here alive.${prompt};
General Zazarg is carved from the stone he takes his name from.;
I've seen him bend swords with his bare fingers.${prompt};
And so this mighty Galka entered the country with relatively little difficulty.;
Then what happened?${prompt};
Well, for a time, he worked as a freelance mercenary and picked up the odd smuggling job on the side to pay his debt to the organization that helped him get here.${prompt};
What a tragic turn of events.;
One day, the captain of an elite military unit, the next, a simple mercenary grubbing for coins...${prompt};
You have no idea.;
Back then, the Imperial Army treated mercenaries as little more than cannon fodder.${prompt};
Even I was guilty of an unconscious bias when it came to the hired swords in our company.${prompt};
But then there came an event that would turn Zazarg's life around.${prompt};
Oho!;
And!? And!?${prompt};
Salaheem's Sentinels was founded.${prompt};
That's the big, life-changing event?;
How could that greedy president and her soul-devouring company help anyone...?${prompt};
I can see why you'd think that considering its current reputation, but Salaheem's Sentinels was established with Imperial authorization.${prompt};
And President Naja's “negotiations” with the commanding officers did have a positive effect on mercenary treatment.${prompt};
Hmmm...;
And I suppose Zazarg joined the company?${prompt};
Yes.${prompt};
And from then on, not a day passed when the name of Zazarg wasn't spoken in relation to some great deed.${prompt};
He was renowned not only for his prowess in battle, but also for leadership among his fellow mercenaries.${prompt};
But his true talent lay in his ability to predict an enemy's strategies and to react swiftly to sudden shifts in battle.${prompt};
In time, even the officers from the Imperial Army were visiting Zazarg for advice in military matters.${prompt};
President Naja must have been delighted to have such a valuable employee!${prompt};
So delighted that she opened the Salaheem Officer Academy and appointed Zazarg as its first principal.${prompt};
Principal Zazarg?;
That would be a popular school, I'm sure!${prompt};
I'm afraid not everyone in the Imperial Army was pleased with Zazarg's achievements.${prompt};
One day, a letter detailing his past in the Bastokan Musketeers somehow found its way to the palace...${prompt};
Be at ease.${prompt};
You are Major Zazarg of Salaheem's Sentinels?${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
Word of your impressive deeds has reached us here at the palace.${prompt};
You are most kind.${prompt};
I wonder if you are aware of the rumors circulating around the ports?${prompt};
I apologize, Grand Vizier, but as a soldier, I spend little time listening to gossip.${prompt};
Then allow me to enlighten you.;
The rumors say you were once a member of the Bastokan Gold Musketeers.;
A captain, no less...${prompt};
This is true, sir.${prompt};
Oho, you make no attempt to hide this fact.${prompt};
No, sir. I left the musketeers some time ago, and now make my living as a simple mercenary.${prompt};
You retain no connections?${prompt};
None, sir.${prompt};
Still, this presents us with a dilemma.;
If the Empire were to go to war with Bastok, what would be your position?${prompt};
I would resign my post.;
I wish to shed the blood of my kinsmen as little as I wish to fight the Empire that took me in.${prompt};
A commendable answer.${prompt};
A soldier that would betray his own country cannot be trusted, but it appears you are of different stock...${prompt};
The Empire has need of commanders like you, Major Zazarg.${prompt};
Would you consider taking the position of general in our Imperial Army?;
Your talents are wasted as a sellsword.${prompt};
...;
I accept--with one condition.${prompt};
Name it.${prompt};
I ask that you trust me as you would a native of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
Naturally.;
I would never put you in charge of our elite troops if you weren't to be trusted completely.;
Show me your worth.${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
And so Zazarg found himself catapulted into the position of general.${prompt};
What a fantastic tale!${prompt};
Such a lucrative piece this shall be!${prompt};
Ah...inspirational, I mean.${prompt};
But the story is not done.${prompt};
Ah, of course!;
He is a general, but not yet a Serpent General!;
Please, continue!${prompt};
Ah...;
There is still so much to tell, but I'm afraid I must return to my post.${prompt};
No! You are as cruel as fair Biyaada...!${prompt};
Do you know of the leypoint found deep within the Wajaom Woodlands?${prompt};
Yes, it is very well known. By my attendant here.${prompt};
You can often find General Zazarg there during his off-duty hours.${prompt};
I've heard he searches for something he lost in the area...${prompt};
Perhaps you could try speaking with him in person.${prompt};
Oh, no no no!;
I've had my fill of speaking with generals in person!${prompt};
There is nothing to fear--just mention you are a friend of Talhaal.${prompt};
Good fortune!${prompt};
<Sigh>...${prompt};
Well, I suppose I have no choice...${prompt};
I must risk my loyal attendant once more.;
To the Wajaom Woodlands with you!${prompt};
Are you trying to sabotage my chance at greatness, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Now is not the time for dawdling in teahouses!;
To work! To work!${prompt};
Things are looking grim, Master Fari-Wari.;
You do realize you are an entire week late with your repayment...?${prompt};
I'll have it ready! If you come by tomorrow...;
Yes! The adulation of my audience tonight will provide the funds I require to pay you back in full!${prompt};
You're not gettin' rid of us that easily, pint-size!;
We're under orders to get that money today.;
Now, are you gonna pay up, or do we gotta mess you up!?${prompt};
Well, of course I intend to pay!;
My career as a bard depends on my stainless reputation.;
I am true to my word, as words are all I have...${prompt};
Master Fari-Wari...;
We are not children to be distracted by flowery speech.;
If we return empty-handed, our employer will not be pleased. Do you see our predicament?${prompt};
Uh...let's see here...;
Oh! I have some chocolates in my satchel.;
P-perhaps you might accept one in good faith...?${prompt};
Uh...let's see here...;
Isn't this the logo of that ludicrously expensive club “Merrows”...?${prompt};
Ah! Y-you see, I...I found that chocolate on the street in Balrahn Way!${prompt};
Huh!?;
Are you tryin' to feed us trash you picked up off the street!?${prompt};
N-no, of course not! I would never...!;
Please, if you could allow this transgression to pass for today, I will be able to pay you back in the form of ear--${prompt};
Damn straight we'll take your ears!;
You'll be lucky if that's the only body part we chop off!${prompt};
I believe Master Fari-Wari is referring to the earring. This particular bauble is one of Kshama's works, if I'm not mistaken?${prompt};
Yes! You have quite the eye for jewelry!;
The ladies really gasp and swoon when you walk into the club wearing one of...${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Ah, I mean, this is an heirloom passed down from my dear old grandma.;
I'm sorry, I don't think I could part with it, to be honest...${prompt};
I think you'll be surprised what you can part with if we yank on it hard enough!${prompt};
Gyaaah!;
Hm?${prompt};
Oh! My prayers are answered!;
Great Walahra and Merciful Zahak, it's ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}!${prompt};
You lookin' for trouble, creampuff?;
P-please, allow me to explain!;
It may seem unlikely, but this unassuming ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lass] is actually my exceedingly wealthy patron!${prompt};
Is that right...?${prompt};
So you're tellin' me this scruffy-lookin' “patron” of yours is gonna pay off all your debts?${prompt};
Y-yes!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] doesn't look too sure of that from where I'm standin'!;
I'm gettin' tired of your squirmin', shark bait!${prompt};
For the love of literature!;
Save me, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}!${prompt};
Very well.;
In light of recent developments, I've decided to grant you a period of grace.${prompt};
What in blazes...?;
Are you goin' soft on me?${prompt};
If you'll excuse us for a moment...${prompt};
Doesn't this ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player} look at all familiar to you?;
If the rumors are true, ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] really the one who conversed with the Serpent Generals and procured the intimate details for Master Fari-Wari's epic poems...${prompt};
It wasn't the big-mouthed bard?;
You wouldn't know it, listenin' to that spineless slug tell the tale.${prompt};
You're missing the point.;
If ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player} is acquainted with the Serpent Generals, we may be able to squeeze a far larger purse than the one belonging to our merry minstrel...${prompt};
I don't get it...${prompt};
The generals are the linchpin in the defense of the city.;
A highly respectable position. I'm sure they would go to any lengths to prevent a money-lending scandal in their immediate circle of colleagues from reaching the general public.${prompt};
So you're sayin'...we could lean on them for hush money!${prompt};
I'm saying, that if we do this right, we could be dipping our paws into the palace treasury itself...;
A risky venture, to be sure, but the chance of a lifetime!${prompt};
I like the sound of that...;
I'm in!${prompt};
After talkin' it over with me partner, I've agreed to let you off the hook...for now.${prompt};
We are in the business of making profits, Master Fari-Wari.;
Removing vital portions of your anatomy does little to fill our purses.${prompt};
I expect the entire sum of two hundred gold coins to be waiting for us the next time we come calling...${prompt};
Yes, yes, of course!;
A mere pinprick in the fantastic fortune of my prosperous patron!;
Isn't that right, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}!?${prompt};
Keep yappin', you little...${prompt};
Ohoho, I trust we won't be disappointed, then.;
Until next we meet.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Phew...${prompt};
Yes, yes, I see the disapproval on your face.;
If you could write up a list of grievances, I'll add them to the pile.${prompt};
But there is no time for such trivialities.;
Your continued well-being and my poor ears (and Walahra knows what other bodily appendages) are at stake here!${prompt};
Ah, the acquisition of sordid coin...;
There must be money to be found somewhere...in your bank, for instance? No?${prompt};
You think I should attempt to pen another chapter in the Serpent General saga?${prompt};
Oh no no no.;
I am an artiste--covering the same, tired old theme rails against my creative nature!${prompt};
No, my works must be innovative, fantastic, inspiring!${prompt};
How can I explain this...?${prompt};
It should be verse that grips the reader in inescapable coils of anticipation and excitement...${prompt};
Hm...?;
I'm getting something...;
Yes. Yes!;
I have it!${prompt};
I shall compose a chilling tale that keeps my readers on the edge of their seats from the first syllable to the last!;
A suspense poem thriller!${prompt};
What say you, my faithful attendant?;
Do you not agree that this will be the next craze to capture the hearts of the citizenry?${prompt};
Do you agree?;
${selection-lines};
Oh, absolutely.;
Not really...${prompt};
Yes! Absolute madness of the masses!;
You know, sometimes I'm so brilliant I even scare myself.${prompt};
Great and merciful Zahak!;
How cruel of you to deprive this simple being of the slightest hint of good taste!${prompt};
My dear attendant, if you do not pry open that rusty mind of yours, you'll never survive in the constantly evolving world of written entertainment!${prompt};
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation, Mister Fari-Wari.;
Perhaps I can be of some service?${prompt};
Hm?;
You have a sack of coins under the counter for just such an emergency? Wonderful! Sling it over, my good man!${prompt};
Ah, no. I was talking about the new poem...${prompt};
If it's suspense and thrills you're looking for, I might have the very tale to base it on...${prompt};
Oho! Fari-Wari the Eloquent (and never Egotistical!) is always open to suggestions!${prompt};
So, what juicy rumors does the master of the teahouse keep under his apron?;
I'll be more than happy to appropriate and elaborate in the name of art!${prompt};
Ah...well, then...;
Did you ever hear about the “Pamama Murders”?${prompt};
Pamamas? As in the yellow curved fruit?;
My dear fellow, please tell me you aren't about to explain a series of unfortunate slippings on pamama peels?${prompt};
Ah, so you don't know.;
It was the talk of the town for a short while, before the Immortals declared the reports false and ruthlessly quashed the story.${prompt};
It all happened about two years ago.;
A series of incidents began, where every night an important Imperial official or officer was assassinated.${prompt};
Matters became so serious, that a nightly curfew was imposed on the capital.${prompt};
Aha! That explains my inability to locate any charming young ladies to woo during that stretch of time...${prompt};
I'm sorry?${prompt};
Ahem...;
Nothing at all! Please, do continue with your tale.${prompt};
They were truly bizarre cases--all of the victims were wealthy and had expensive tastes, but nothing was ever taken.;
And there was a single common factor in all of the murders...${prompt};
A common factor?${prompt};
Without fail, the victim's face was covered with a carefully splayed pamama peel, like a large, yellow flower in full bloom...${prompt};
<Snort>...surely you jest?${prompt};
It was no laughing matter.;
The murderer was never caught, and the case was officially shut down. It remains a mystery until this day.${prompt};
Hmmm...might it have been some Far Eastern ninja spy? A Lamia hitwoman?;
This story reeks...of untapped potential!${prompt};
I had hoped as much.;
As it happens, the detective originally assigned to the case by the Imperial Palace is one of my regulars.;
Shall I introduce you?${prompt};
Do moneylenders like to break kneecaps?;
I would be overjoyed to meet this detective. I should frame an autograph for your store to express my gratitude...${prompt};
Ah...it's really no trouble.;
After all, your fans are the reason my teahouse is doing so well.${prompt};
The detective is a Hume by the name of Eunheem.${prompt};
Well, to be precise, he is no longer a detective.;
After the failed case, he enlisted in the Imperial Army and now serves as a guard on Balrahn Way.${prompt};
My eternal thanks.;
Once my suspense poem thriller has sold in the millions, I shall be delighted to compose a jingle for your store at a discounted rate!${prompt};
Everyone try the sutlac, so creamy and sweet.♪;
Shararat Teahouse, where Fari-Wari comes to eat!♪${prompt};
Ah!;
No no no, you've already done so much for my business! That really won't be necessary!${prompt};
You heard the man, ${name-player}.;
It's time for us to pick up the trail!;
And by “us,” I mean “you,” of course!${prompt};
Hm? You're looking for information?${prompt};
The “Pamama Murders”...?${prompt};
(That was my biggest, and most fruitless, case. Why are you looking into it now?)${prompt};
(No, the reason doesn't matter. I was never happy with the decision to shelve that investigation...)${prompt};
(Maybe we can help each other out here...)${prompt};
(Now, I don't want to risk my military career because I broke confidentiality. So, I'm going to mumble to myself, and you're going to “overhear.” You got that? I didn't tell you anything.)${prompt};
(About the time the murders started, I was one of the top detectives in my agency.)${prompt};
(I had built a solid reputation for solving difficult cases--a reputation that led the Imperial Army to ask for me by name.)${prompt};
(The assignment for that cursed pamama case came from the Skyserpent General himself...)${prompt};
What can you tell me?${prompt};
The victim has had his kidney cut out with a single, circular incision from behind...;
It speaks volumes about the skill of the attacker.${prompt};
According to the servant who found the body, a pamama peel was found stuffed into the victim's mouth...${prompt};
I imagine this was to block the throat and prevent any cries for help.${prompt};
At first, I thought the same...;
But why a pamama peel? Could there be a reason for this strange choice of method?${prompt};
Interesting...;
These obviously expensive accoutrements remain undisturbed, so we can rule out simple burglary.;
Could we be looking at a murder of revenge?${prompt};
Revenge?;
The victim was well known for his noble service in the position of governor-general.${prompt};
His decisions were fair and just.;
I couldn't think of any reason why anyone would wish him harm.${prompt};
I mean no offense, but it is exactly for the reasons you can't think of that people engender the antagonism of others.;
We must keep our minds clear of preconceptions.${prompt};
You're quite correct...${prompt};
General Rughadjeen.;
Since when was the head of Al Zahbi's military defense put in charge of criminal investigations?${prompt};
Raubahn.;
I was under the impression that any crime within the city that held possible beastman connections was within my rights to investigate.${prompt};
Very well.;
Allow me to relate to you the details of the case.${prompt};
This man you hold in such high esteem is under suspicion of receiving bribes from provincial lords.${prompt};
The Immortals have been conducting a discreet investigation for quite some time.${prompt};
Then revenge is not an unlikely motivation after all...${prompt};
Have you been following the stirrings in the palace?;
This is the twelfth in a series of killings.${prompt};
The twelfth?;
How is this possible!?${prompt};
Severing of the carotid artery, blunt force trauma to the base of the skull, poison dart, strangulation by ameretat vine...;
The methods of murder have been varied and violent.${prompt};
However, every single victim has been found with a pamama peel inserted into the mouth.${prompt};
And each has, without exception, been a high-ranking Imperial official.${prompt};
A serial killer...?${prompt};
We have also determined that the targets were all involved in some form of political corruption to a greater or lesser degree.${prompt};
Are you now satisfied that this case is beyond the scope of a simple beastman plot?${prompt};
I am satisfied.;
This case is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Immortals.${prompt};
However, there remains a danger to the person of Her Magnificence, the Empress.;
I will be expecting updates on the progress of your investigation.${prompt};
Of course, Skyserpent General.${prompt};
(I continued the investigation at the personal behest of the Skyserpent General, but made little headway, even as the murders continued night after night...)${prompt};
(Then came the Walahra Scholarship Award Ceremony incident...)${prompt};
(Soon afterwards, the Skyserpent General came to the agency, paid the investigation fees in full, and officially terminated his case request.)${prompt};
(However, I was never able to forgive myself for being unable to dig up a single clue...and quit the agency in disgrace.)${prompt};
(Hm?;
The Walahra Scholarship Award Ceremony?)${prompt};
(You know of Walahra Temple?;
Since ages past, droves of talented students have converged on the temple to study the philosophy of Walahra.)${prompt};
(The most promising of these students are awarded scholarships from the Imperial Palace.)${prompt};
(But during the most recent ceremony, an assassin slipped into the palace to make an attempt on the Empress's life.)${prompt};
(The matter was handled internally to avoid undue panic, so it's not surprising few are aware the incident even occurred at all.)${prompt};
(Well, I've told you this much...I might as well let you in on my suspicions.)${prompt};
(I believe the murders and the incident at the palace to be connected. Call it a detective's instinct...)${prompt};
(But a washed-up private eye like myself will never be permitted to snoop around the Imperial grounds, looking for clues.)${prompt};
(And that's another reason the case remains inscrutable for me...)${prompt};
(That's a determined look you have there.)${prompt};
(Perhaps you will be the one to get to the bottom of this mystery...and satisfy an old gumshoe's professional curiosity.)${prompt};
Welcome to Walahra Temple.;
Our doors are always open to those seeking knowledge.${prompt};
How may I aid you in your quest for higher understanding?${prompt};
Ah, you are investigating the series of murders that took place two years ago...?;
You are to be commended for your dedication.${prompt};
But I am a simple scholar. I have few dealings with secular society and know precious little about that case.;
I only wish I could help you more...${prompt};
However, I do recall the incident at the award ceremony quite clearly.${prompt};
A foreign student, Mihli Aliapoh, excelled in her studies and was chosen to represent the scholarship candidates.${prompt};
We were blessed with many promising young academics that year. It is truly unfortunate that such an awful...${prompt};
Hm?;
Oh, I thought it common knowledge.${prompt};
The Springserpent General was once one of our brightest students.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Mihli?${prompt};
Elder Nadeey...${prompt};
Be at ease, Mihli.;
It is permitted to leave your studies for this hour every day.;
The other students are outside the city, enjoying the fresh air...${prompt};
They're welcome to it...;
I don't like big grrroups.${prompt};
Walahra once said:${prompt};
“Let us drink and talk together, my friend. For in doing so, new truths will be born this night.”;
Everybody needs companions to share thoughts with, Mihli.${prompt};
I'm here on the generrrosity of my village's people. I can't waste time mindlessly chatting.;
I'll talk to Walahra thrrrough my books.${prompt};
Your progress has been exemplary, Mihli.;
Won't you share what you have learned with your fellow students?${prompt};
Why should I?;
When I arrived, all they did was make fun of my accent.${prompt};
That was before they learned more of acceptance and humility. I am sure they feel shame now when they think of their past actions.${prompt};
I kind of doubt it...;
Everyone is just wearing a mask--them, you, even me...${prompt};
Mihli, knowledge is multiplied by teaching and learning with others.;
Look at this girl...${prompt};
She has trouble concentrating and often makes mistakes in her exams.;
You could be of immeasurable help to such a lost karakul...${prompt};
You think she's a lost karakul?;
I didn't think you were so blind, Elder Nadeey.${prompt};
Mihli...!${prompt};
M-Mihli...${prompt};
Ah, I-I...;
I thought you might like to share some afternoon tea since you didn't eat anything for lunch...${prompt};
I bought some balik sandvici...;
Well, I've seen you fishing at the port some evenings, and I thought you might like...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Actually, I-I'm pretty interested in Tsahya.;
You know, the coral, and the Opo-opos...;
I was hoping you might tell me about your home...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh, and also--${prompt};
I can't stand the smell of brrread...;
Why don't you eat it yourself?${prompt};
Um, Mihli...?${prompt};
She is now a famous general, of course.;
And only this dusty scholar remembers that time...${prompt};
Ah, forgive me.;
You wished to know about the Walahra Scholarship Award Ceremony.${prompt};
Perhaps you might try speaking with the student representative from the ceremony herself?${prompt};
Mihli is still rather abrasive towards people, I'm afraid...${prompt};
But I believe she may hold some clues to the case you pursue.${prompt};
The truth will not evade one who seeks it with an open mind...${prompt};
Ah, my attendant!;
Um, that is to say, ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}!${prompt};
And so? What of the spine-chilling, hair-raising, nail-biting Pamama Murders?${prompt};
What do you tell Fari-Wari?;
${selection-lines};
The “safe“ version.;
The “full“ version.${prompt};
The case remains unsolved?${prompt};
And you happened to see the Springserpent General slip on a pamama peel...?${prompt};
This is hopeless!;
I'm looking for suspense, not slapstick!${prompt};
Th-that's unbelievable!${prompt};
When the Springserpent General was a struggling student, she leaped on the Skyserpent General's sword, and attempted to eviscerate the Empress...!?${prompt};
Even Fari-Wari the Eloquent cannot turn such a tale of misery and treason into a suspense poem thriller! The Immortals would hang me with my own treacherous tongue!${prompt};
Your research is far from fruitless, but there is nothing here for my mystery mega hit...${prompt};
I'm done for. Done for, I tell you!${prompt};
Master Fari-Wari.;
Did I just hear you say you were done?${prompt};
<Gulp>!${prompt};
I'm bettin' he ain't done a single verse, and don't have a single coin to his name...${prompt};
O-of course I'm done!;
I have a splendid song that shall spark a cacophonous controversy!${prompt};
How fascinating.;
Well then, let us hear this dramatic verse.${prompt};
I...I don't think this an appropriate venue for such a sizzling satire...${prompt};
You do have a poem, don't you, Master Fari-Wari?${prompt};
Y-yes, yes!;
A new installment in the Serpent General series.;
“Mihli of the Southern Isle”...${prompt};
The title is somewhat lackluster...${prompt};
Um...born a Mithra, this island girl,;
Thrown to the jungle and raised by a coeurl.♪;
More beast than beauty, the ferocious Mihli!♪${prompt};
Never wore clothing, this beast-girl ran bare,;
Without even leopard-skin underwear!♪;
Ate Opo-opos and pamamas, the ferocious Mihli!♪${prompt};
She would gnaw on the bones, and chew on the peels,;
It sure was a fright to watch her take meals!♪;
Chomping and munching, the ferocious Mihli!♪${prompt};
Uhuh...;
What comes next?${prompt};
When nature called, she would lift up one leg,;
And try to avoid splashing her...${prompt};
Hm...?${prompt};
Aaargh!!!${prompt};
Wh-what do you mean to do with us!?${prompt};
You were listening.;
That makes you accomplices!${prompt};
Hey, now just a minute...!?${prompt};
Oof...!${prompt};
I oughta give you the same trrreatment...but that's not why I'm here.${prompt};
It's not like I came looking for you, or anything...${prompt};
But, well, since you...;
I mean, I thought that...${prompt};
I thought I should at least ask your name!${prompt};
Hmm...${name-player}, huh?${prompt};
Well, I won't bite your head off the next time you say hello.${prompt};
See you arrround, ${name-player}!${prompt};
On the trail, my dear attendant.;
Time grows short!${prompt};
Yes, inescapable coils of anticipation...;
That will go on the poster!${prompt};
Walahra Temple can be found just past Serpentking Square.${prompt};
To think, these two cases might finally see the light of day...${prompt};
This is no time to stand around sipping chai, my dear attendant!;
We must make haste for Mount Zhayolm!${prompt};
You know the small footpath that winds its way to Halvung, don't you?;
I'll race you there! Ready...set...go!${prompt};
How can you stand here twiddling your thumbs with the mystery of the Flameserpent General waiting to be solved?${prompt};
We're to rendezvous at Mount Zhayolm, remember?;
No dallying now! Chop, chop!${prompt};
You'll go back to retrieve that ${item-singular: 0[2]} for me, won't you?;
We can't let Shayadar down, after all...${prompt};
Now wherever could I have dropped it?;
I certainly hope it wasn't carried off by some starry-eyed Troll!${prompt};
The plot thickens, my dear attendant!;
You'll be returning to Mount Zhayolm to continue the investigation, no?${prompt};
I can't help but think that this ${item-singular: 0[2]} holds the key to our mystery...${prompt};
The piercing intuition of Fari-Wari the Astute has never failed, after all.;
Now, off to Mount Zhayolm with you!${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} was returned to you!;
My dear attendant! Sit down and have a cup of chai!;
I really can't thank you enough for assisting me with the completion of my epic--and critically acclaimed--Serpent General pentalogy.${prompt};
No rest for the weary minstrel, though!;
You wouldn't happen to have an idea for my next magnum opus, would you?${prompt};
The heart-pounding and hair-raising saga of the legendary hero Balrahn?;
No, too cliche, methinks...${prompt};
Wait...I've got it!;
The loving bond between master and pupil...the heart-warming tale of Fari-Wari the Eloquent and his devoted attendant!${prompt};
What's the matter, ${name-player}? You look positively pale!;
Did you eat a rotten puk egg?;
Lalala-la.♪ Lu-lu.♪${prompt};
Have you ever heard the saying, “A tiny hole can sink even the largest ship”?${prompt};
It means that overlooking the smallest detail can lead to disastrous results.${prompt};
There is a man under my command by the name of Isween.;
He's been acting somewhat strangely of late...${prompt};
Now, this is the kind of man whose knees shake at the very sight of a beastman, and looks more comfortable holding a book than a sword.${prompt};
Isween has nothing even approximating a backbone, and was apparently more or less bullied into joining this mercenary unit by his peers.${prompt};
But recently he's been refusing to contribute to the defense of the city, and has even threatened to leave the mercenaries.${prompt};
According to his companions, Isween has been making trips into the Wajaom Woodlands every night and not returning until dawn.${prompt};
What would a coward like Isween be doing wandering around that monster-infested wilderness alone?${prompt};
Picture, if you will, my mercenary unit as a ship. It is my responsibility to steer this vessel to a beastman-free paradise.${prompt};
In order for this voyage to be successful, I have to be aware of any potential holes in the hull.${prompt};
I cannot let this ship sink!${prompt};
Do you understand what I'm saying?${prompt};
That is why I want you to find out what Isween is doing in the Wajaom Woodlands every night.${prompt};
I could send one of my own men, but I'm afraid the rumors would affect morale.${prompt};
It could be nothing at all, but you can't be too careful.${prompt};
I just hope this is an overreaction on my part...${prompt};
Ah, you're back.${prompt};
That matter we discussed...;
It appears my fears were well-founded.${prompt};
I've learned that Isween has been meeting with a beastman in the woodlands.${prompt};
I never would have believed he would be trading our secrets to those savages...${prompt};
Isween!;
You better have a good explanation!${prompt};
...${prompt};
You've betrayed us. You've betrayed the people you swore to protect!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hey!;
Don't you have anything to say for yourself!?${prompt};
Enough. I'll take it from here.;
Isween.;
If you've done nothing wrong, then you have no need to keep silent.${prompt};
I don't care where you go, or who you meet in the middle of the night.${prompt};
But if that rendezvous is with a beastman, then we have a problem.${prompt};
These mercenaries put their lives on the line to keep the townspeople safe from those creatures.${prompt};
What are you doing meeting up with one of their kind?;
You had better start talking.${prompt};
...I...I'll tell you.${prompt};
It all started during a recent siege of Al Zahbi...${prompt};
I had no stomach for fighting, and was merely swept into the conflict by those around me.;
I despise the brutality of war, and was mortified to find myself in the center of the carnage...;
The thought that my actions were for the benefit of Al Zahbi's citizens was the only thing that consoled me.;
During the battle I was chased by a beastman, and found myself on the outskirts of town...${prompt};
Phew...;
I think I lost him...${prompt};
!!!;
!!!;
Wait!${prompt};
This nice beastman saved me from being taken away...${prompt};
Don't hurt him!${prompt};
Bad, is war. Suffering, war brings.;
No more, we fight.${prompt};
The moment I heard those words it was as if a dark cloud had been lifted from my heart. “Maybe we can put an end to it,” I thought.${prompt};
From that time on, I met with the beastman every night in the Wajaom Woodlands, and we spoke of ways to bring an end to war between our people.${prompt};
There must be something we can do...${prompt};
An end to war, we want.;
But an end to war, we don't want.${prompt};
Hm?;
“We”...? But aren't you the only one who feels this way?;
You should say “I,” not “we.”${prompt};
You have a unique identity that is separate from all others.;
When you speak of your own thoughts, you need to say “I.”${prompt};
“I”...?;
“We”...${prompt};
An end to war, I want.;
An end to war, we don't want.${prompt};
Very difficult...${prompt};
We met many times after that and continued our discussions.${prompt};
He began to seem like a friend I had always known...${prompt};
And this is the creature you met with last night as well?${prompt};
Yes.;Oui.
Only...${prompt};
Only?${prompt};
Waaa!${prompt};
!!!;
Gukool Ja!;
What are you doing here!?${prompt};
Hey! You can't...!;
What is wrong with you!?${prompt};
Gukool Ja!;
Why do you do this!?${prompt};
Isween!;
This is the beastman you were telling us about?;
He doesn't seem very friendly to me!${prompt};
He was just using you for information!;
You've been had!${prompt};
N-no, it can't be...;
He saved that child once, why would he take her now...?${prompt};
There must be some mistake.;
I...I have to speak with him!${prompt};
Mercenaries! Follow Isween and don't let him out of your sight.;
That girl's life depends on it!${prompt};
Isween, you fool...;
Do you realize the den into which you blindly rush?${prompt};
Mamook.;
The stronghold of the Mamool Ja.${prompt};
My men are too few to survive a foray into that place...${prompt};
You must help them.;
Make your way to Mamook, I'll be right behind you.${prompt};
Make your way to Mamook, I'll be right behind you.${prompt};
Oh, it's you again.;
Hm? You have something to say to me?${prompt};
I see...;
So you witnessed the events in Mamook?${prompt};
I hope you don't make the mistake of thinking I'm a friend to the beastmen.${prompt};
Yes, I do have occasion to meet and exchange information with the Mamool Ja.${prompt};
I find that a connection with your enemy can often work to your advantage.;
Not all wars are won with brute force.${prompt};
I am simply protecting this city the best way I know how.${prompt};
I knew from the start that Isween was meeting with that beastman.${prompt};
But when the Mamool Ja found out, they were ready for blood.;
I had to send you to watch over him for me.${prompt};
With a powerful adventurer like you on his side, the beastmen would hesitate to strike.${prompt};
Isween came out of this unscathed, so I suppose all's well that ends well.;
And you can't blame me for placing you in danger's path. Isn't that what adventurers are here for?${prompt};
You want to know what happened to Isween?${prompt};
He's left my unit for good.${prompt};
He still dreams of carrying out his friend's wishes, and putting a stop to war...${prompt};
I've never seen Isween shine with so much conviction.;
He's like a new person...;
Heh, who would've thought it?${prompt};
Do you remember the saying I told you, “A tiny hole can sink even the largest ship”?${prompt};
It just may be that Isween will be the tiny light that brings an end to this conflict.${prompt};
Even the largest tree was once a slender sapling...;
I truly hope that he continues to grow in spirit.${prompt};
It would be worth losing my livelihood to see an age without war.${prompt};
Why, you ask?${prompt};
Everyone wants to live their lives without the threat of death hanging over them every second of the day...${prompt};
You've helped us more than you can know.${prompt};
Oh, and try to keep my relations with the Mamool Ja a secret, would you?${prompt};
Here's a little something to guarantee your silence.${prompt};
...;
The potential is ready for your inspection.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] cobalt levels were very low, and I was afraid this would be another failure. But ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] somehow clawed ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] way back from the edge of death.${prompt};
Hmph. ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] answers were not entirely truthful.${prompt};
You were the one who transplanted this!${prompt};
This...${wait-36: 2};
...loathsome Ahriman lens!${prompt};
Hold your tongues.;
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] awakens...;
...;
The long gallery remains dark in the glow of infinite lights.;
What meaning lies behind these words...?${prompt};
My apologies.;
I but ponder aloud the mysteries of the universe. Pay me no heed.${prompt};
Ah, a visitor from foreign shores. Greetings.;
I am Waoud, a humble seer of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
I divine from your appearance that you hail from the western continent...;
A place we here know as the “Middle Lands.”;
An adventurer, yes?${prompt};
The Empire of Aht Urhgan recruits mercenaries on a grand scale, as she does all things.;
Our meager city has become a scurrying anthill of activity.${prompt};
But you did not come to hear simple gossip.;
Destiny brought you to me, and it is of destiny I shall speak.;
I require less coin from adventurers for my divinations, considering their...uncertain employment.${prompt};
Do you wish to gaze on the tapestry that fate has woven for you?;
I require less coin from adventurers for my divinations, considering their...uncertain employment.${prompt};
Gaze on fate's tapestry?;
${selection-lines};
Gaze away.;
I weave my own tapestry.${prompt};
A pity. Perhaps another time.${prompt};
The merchants of foreign lands have a saying: “Gil is the glue that brings us together.”${prompt};
I am afraid your purse is a trifle light today...${prompt};
Most excellent.;
I shall now proceed to ask you several questions.${prompt};
My divinations follow a somewhat unorthodox process.;
Answer truthfully and all shall be revealed.${prompt};
What is destiny?${prompt};
Destiny is something that...;
${selection-lines};
Is immutable.;
One forges for oneself.;
Is unknowable.${prompt};
Does the accomplishment of a goal require sacrifice and hardship?${prompt};
Do goals require sacrifice?;
${selection-lines};
Not if you think hard enough.;
Occasionally.;
Absolutely.${prompt};
You hold in your hands a forbidden scroll.;
Reading it will bring you untold wisdom, but cost all that you own.${prompt};
Do you...;
${selection-lines};
Read the scroll?;
Throw the scroll away?;
Burn the scroll?${prompt};
If the loss of one life would save ten thousand, would you offer yourself without hesitation?${prompt};
Offer yourself?;
${selection-lines};
Offer another...;
I have no such courage.;
Without hesitation.${prompt};
Would you choose a tumultuous life where fame or fortune were attainable, or a tranquil life where both were forever beyond your reach?${prompt};
Which do you choose?;
${selection-lines};
A chaotic life.;
A tranquil life.;
A mix of both.${prompt};
You stand on the precipice between life and death.;
Would you choose to live life as a beast if it would save you from falling into the shadowy abyss of the underworld?${prompt};
What do you do?;Que fais-tu?
${selection-lines};
If it keeps me from dying...;
Fall, and keep my humanity.;
Embrace life as a beast.${prompt};
A companion in battle turns against you, raising a weapon to attack.${prompt};
Do you...;
${selection-lines};
Brace for the blow?;
Try to reason with him?;
Cut him down?${prompt};
A loved one is afflicted with a terrible illness and has little time left to live.;
You are asked to end that life by your own hand.${prompt};
Do you...;
${selection-lines};
Seek a cure?;
Leave the world together?;
Grant the request?${prompt};
You are in the midst of a fierce battle.;
The enemy lying at your feet was once a friend.;
His breath is ragged and weak.${prompt};
Do you...;
${selection-lines};
Tend to his wounds?;
End his pain?;
Ignore your old friend?${prompt};
A superior to whom you owe a great debt orders you to act in a way that violates your sense of justice.${prompt};
Do you...;
${selection-lines};
Try to remove him from power?;
Carry out the order?;
Follow your sense of justice?${prompt};
Thank you for your patience. The answers you have provided will be most helpful in my divination.;
Let us look upon what has been revealed...${prompt};
I see the symbol of the Skyserpent.;
It suggests spending some time away from battle.${prompt};
For a change of pace, why not try your hand at harvesting in the Wajaom Woodlands or Bhaflau Thickets?${prompt};
You may make an unexpected discovery.${prompt};
I see the symbol of the Flameserpent.;
It suggests you take an aggressive stance and not shy away from a challenge.${prompt};
Perhaps you might try visiting the Commissions Agency.;
A substantial reward could be yours for the taking.${prompt};
I see the symbol of the Galeserpent.;
It suggests a loss in the near future...${prompt};
Even I cannot predict what this loss may entail.;
You would do well to pay close attention to your possessions.${prompt};
I see the symbol of the Stoneserpent.;
It suggests you will receive a boon from the earth.${prompt};
A boon from the earth...?;
Ah yes, a stint at mining may prove beneficial.;
All signs point towards Mount Zhayolm...${prompt};
I see the symbol of the Springserpent.;
It suggests a sojourn to the sea.${prompt};
Yes, a tranquil journey on the waves.;
Replace your weapon with a fishing pole and fate will smile upon you.${prompt};
My divination is over.;
I trust you are satisfied?${prompt};
As divining is my stock in trade, it may hardly surprise you to know that I believe destiny to be an ever flowing river of possibilities.${prompt};
Yet there are also those who see destiny as immutable and inescapable.;
Which do you believe, I wonder...?${prompt};
...But I digress.;
If you desire to hear my divinations again, return here after one full cycle of the sun.${prompt};
May the True Serpent of Walahra hold you firmly in its coils...${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You pay 1000 gil for the divination.${prompt};
Sky, Flame, Gale, Stone, and Spring.;
I see all five serpent symbols...${wait-36: 2};
This sign heralds a turning point in your destiny.${prompt};
A time will come when you must choose one of two paths.;
The road you walk will be entirely up to you...${prompt};
Even I cannot ascertain what awaits you at the end of each path.;
Yet one must be chosen nonetheless.${prompt};
This choice cannot be avoided...${prompt};
...My divination is at an end.;
Have I unsettled you?${prompt};
Ahahaha.;
A seer I may be, but I suggest you take these divinations with a light heart--no matter what the signs suggest.${prompt};
Should a sign prove to be the gentle push that was needed, then consider it a blessing.${prompt};
Now comes the matter of payment...;
I am told that an object of incredible rarity can be found in the Middle Lands.${prompt};
Would you consider bringing me this prize in place of common coin?${prompt};
To be truthful, the one who wishes to gaze upon this object is my own bedridden mother.;
A final wish from a curious old lady...${prompt};
Do not concern yourself with haste. My dear mother clings to life with surprising ferocity.${prompt};
The object of which I speak is precious in the Near East, but worth precious little elsewhere...${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a jewel.;
It is said to glow with a bluish tint and be found near the bank of a certain river.${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a jewel.;
It is said to glow with a bluish tint and be found near the bank of a certain river.${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a pinch of golden sand.;
It is said to glow with the light of the sun and be found only on a certain beach.${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a pinch of golden sand.;
It is said to glow with the light of the sun and be found only on a certain beach.${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a precious stone.;
It is said to be as red as blood and found in a land of geysers.${prompt};
The treasure I would have you seek is a precious stone.;
It is said to be as red as blood and found in a land of geysers.${prompt};
The discovery of this object is apparently made easier under very particular conditions, but I am not sufficiently familiar with the geography of your continent to even know where to start.${prompt};
I cannot provide you with the name of this treasure, but perhaps with your knowledge...${prompt};
...My apologies.;
You do not need to hear the woes of some street-corner fortuneteller.${prompt};
In fact, I shall not ask payment of you this day.;
And please forget my unreasonable request.;
May fortune smile upon you...${prompt};
Ah, you have returned.;
I hope you have forgotten our previous exchange.;
My words were hasty and ill-considered...${prompt};
Your words have...;
${selection-lines};
...moved me to action.;
...been forgotten.${prompt};
Are you sure of this?;
A thousand thousand blessings on your house!;
I am speechless with gratitude...${prompt};
Again, my apologies!;
I know not the name of the object, but I do remember some clues...${prompt};
Its discovery is apparently made easier under very particular conditions, but I cannot provide you with any details. My original source of information returned home to the Middle Lands before I could learn more.${prompt};
But with your knowledge of that continent, you may have a chance...${prompt};
May the winds of fortune guide you!${prompt};
I know not the name of the object, but I do recall some clues...${prompt};
Yes! This is the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} the traveler spoke of!${prompt};
Ah...${prompt};
To be perfectly honest, it was the mother of a colleague who wished to gaze upon this treasure...${prompt};
I am afraid I have another favor to ask you...;
Would you consent to deliver this to my colleague?;
I cannot leave the city, you see...${prompt};
A thousand thousand apologies.${prompt};
My colleague is currently part of an Imperial patrol that apprehends desecrators of the ruins found in the Aydeewa Subterrane.${prompt};
The Aydeewa Subterrane runs beneath Bhaflau Thickets.;
May the winds of fortune guide you.${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};
${color-alt: 15}DEBUG: Your cobalt value is ${number: 7} percent.;
${color-alt: 15}DEBUG: Your divination results are now beyond the realm of mortal men. Lucky you.;
You had no reason to return here...${prompt};
Why do you stand before me...?${prompt};
You have made the sacrifice and joined the ranks of the blue mages.${prompt};
What more could you desire?${wait-36: 2};
You are a vessel, newly made...${prompt};
How you fill that vessel is entirely up to you.${prompt};
As you perfect the arts of the blue mage, you will feel blue magic taking root in your very bones.${prompt};
However, attempting to harness a power that overflows your ability to hold it is a sure road to destruction...${prompt};
You would do well to remember that.${prompt};
So what are you to do?${prompt};
Hehe... The answer is simple.${wait-36: 1};
Grow in strength until your body can withstand the power you desire.${wait-36: 2};
The vessel you have become can be tempered and expanded.${prompt};
You were told:;
“A blue mage must wrest ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] strength and vitality from ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] enemies.”${prompt};
Show me the depths of your desire for power...${prompt};
If you can uncover the strength within you to rival my insight...${wait-36: 3};
...But I have said too much.${prompt};
${name-player}.${wait-36: 2};
Go forth and devour the essence of your foes.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't the “potential.”;
No longer an empty vessel, I see.${prompt};
And yet you maintain your mortal form in spite of the power you wield.;
Have you accepted the fact that the path of mortality is forever closed to you now?${prompt};
Have you accepted the fact?;
${selection-lines};
...;
I have.${prompt};
What's this?;
Has the simple power of speech abandoned you already?${prompt};
It is not beyond imagining.;
You have devoured the essence of many foes--blue magic has unexpected effects on the practitioner.${prompt};
You cannot undo the flow of time.;
Be at ease. Let go of your regrets.;
I will show you the way.${prompt};
${name-player}, there is no turning back.;
You must travel to the five staging points in search of even greater power.${prompt};
I am glad that you understand your fate.${prompt};
It is time for you to travel to the five staging points in search of even greater power.${prompt};
Azouph. Dvucca. Mamool Ja. Halvung. Ilrusi.${prompt};
There you will find your fellows--those who strive to be more than mortal while fending off the madness that erodes their souls.${prompt};
Some are vessels that merely mimic the shape of men and women, overflowing with savage energies...${prompt};
...while others have achieved a balance between the nature of mortal and beast...${prompt};
They have long walked the road you now stand upon.${prompt};
Burn their lessons into your heart, and forge your path with renewed vigor.${prompt};
For no other paths remain open to you...${prompt};
The symbol of guidance.;
Four lamps surround a mystical gate.;
The opening of this gate will lead you to distant lands.${prompt};
To the land that lies east of Nashmau, beyond the Deadmist Marsh...${prompt};
To the land that lies west of the city of Mamook...${prompt};
To the land that lies in the northeastern shadow of Mount Zhayolm...${prompt};
To the land that lies west, across the sea from Nashmau...${prompt};
To the land that lies in the northern caverns of the Arrapago Reef...${prompt};
So, you have returned from your journey.${prompt};
The Immortals have submitted their reports.${prompt};
My evaluation?;
You are still not fit to join our ranks.${prompt};
However, I will recognize your continued growth and dedication.${prompt};
Greater heights of power await you...;
Let the desire that burns within you guide your way.${prompt};
Ambition is the only fuel that a blue mage requires.${prompt};
You have taken the first steps, but this is only the beginning.${prompt};
I present you with this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a fitting blade for the path you must carve.${prompt};
Wield it well.;
The phenomenon...assaulting you...${prompt};
...is the result of...the blue magic...invading every cell...of your body...${prompt};
While your physical form...struggles to contain this energy, your soul is crying out in agony...;
The vessel that you have become has reached its limit.${prompt};
This is my private domain--a place separated from the outside world through the power of the magic I have devoured.;
Here, isolated from reality, the state of a soul's deterioration is far more obvious.${prompt};
Do you lack even the strength to stand?${prompt};
You must have gorged yourself on the essence of your enemies to reach this condition.${prompt};
Very well.;
The depths of your ambition have been noted.${prompt};
It is not for me to prevent your self-destruction.;
Your limits are your own to conquer.${prompt};
A resilient spirit to control the fear and allure aroused by the savage magic you devour...;
A willingness to discard your very self, should it lead to the achievement you desire...${prompt};
These are the qualities every blue mage must possess.${prompt};
There is no salvation for you.;
Either you wait for oblivion to claim you, or continue to writhe within the energies of your foes.;
You stand at a fork in the road.${prompt};
Listen well, ${name-player}.;
Should you decide on a life consumed with the struggle for power, I can show you the path...${prompt};
Travel to the Navukgo Execution Chamber, and destroy the flan that are resisting the Imperial Army.${prompt};
A simple task for a seasoned blue mage--not so simple for you, perhaps...${prompt};
Be tempered by the obstacles you overcome.;
Show me the strength of your will.${prompt};
The symbol of trials...;
Traverse the dead fields where no plant or animal thrives.;
You will find your destination beyond the sea of fire.${prompt};
The beasts left behind when the vessel is shattered...${prompt};
I have just received a report from the Imperial Army on the success of your task.;
Your skills as a blue mage are to be commended.${prompt};
In recognition of this achievement, I give you leave to don the magus armor representative of our order.${prompt};
This marks your entrance into the ranks of the Immortals.;
Congratulations, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Visit the store named on this envelope and receive the armor you have earned.${prompt};
Do not forget: our lives are devoted to the protection of the Empress.;
Nothing more, nothing less.${prompt};
We are beasts that owe our existence to the forbearance of Her Magnificence...;
The symbol of encounters...;
The two-headed serpent will open the way.${prompt};
What can I do for you?${prompt};
Wha-!?;
The M-Mark of Zahak!${prompt};
Y-you...you're an Immortal?${prompt};
Oh my!;
A thousand pardons! A thousand thousand pardons!;
You see, the master craftsman...he's...he's not here...;
Your armor is not...it's not ready...${prompt};
I'm, well...you can see how it is.;
Even if I knew where he had gone, I couldn't follow...;
My boss knew this was coming--he has a cruel streak, I fear.${prompt};
It always falls to me to apologize to the customers...${prompt};
What's that?;
You want to know where he's gone?${prompt};
My m-most humble apologies.;
When the orders start piling up, my boss goes fishing.;
“Runs away” is perhaps a more fitting term.;
The problem is, he doesn't go to the sea, or to a river...${prompt};
There's a place beneath the Wajaom Woodlands--an expansive network of caves known as the Aydeewa Subterrane.;
If you went in there without a map, you'd never come out...${prompt};
...${prompt};
I'm sure once my boss comes back, he'll get right to work on your armor...;
That is, if you wouldn't mind waiting.;
A thousand thousand thousand pardons...${prompt};
Oh! It's you.;
The master craftsman has just ret--${prompt};
Ah, you finally made it.;
I have your order all ready and waiting.${prompt};
Standard-quality ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Hmph. Which would make you a newly recruited Immortal.${prompt};
It's been a while since the sight of the Mark of Zahak has thrown my thoughts into such disarray.;
Though it did help to clear my head, strangely enough.${prompt};
So, the armor is yours and our business is done, yes?${prompt};
May the winds of fortune see you on your way!${prompt};
Oh. Um.;
I'm afraid the master craftsman is not available.;
That is to say, he's not here...${prompt};
Our store is small, but we're actually affiliated with the Empire and see to all their uniform needs.;
If you find yourself in service to the Empire, perhaps you'll meet my boss some day...${prompt};
Ah, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] ${name-player}.;
The boss has retired for the day. He won't wake up, even if Al Zahbi comes under attack from the beastmen.;
He's not easily excited...${prompt};
If you have business with my boss, you'll have to wait just a touch.;
A thousand pardons.${prompt};
The symbol of trials...;
Your fate lies beyond the gate of nobility.${prompt};
Impossible.;
We only recently measured the subject's cobalt values.${prompt};
The possibility for this cobalt spike was part of our original calculations.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But we never could have predicted that a subject progressing so smoothly would experience such rapid transformation...${prompt};
Mortal will is a fickle thing.;
This result is not surprising.${prompt};
However, if the subject is discovered, there will be an Imperial inquiry.${prompt};
Agreed.;
The army is not overly fond of the Immortals as it is.${prompt};
The army commanders are wise enough to know when to close their eyes for the good of the Empire, and the Empress.${prompt};
In any case...${prompt};
...${prompt};
The “subject” is far too dangerous an opponent for the average soldier. An entire division of soldiers, for that matter...${prompt};
All the more reason to--${prompt};
You will excuse me.;
Our solution has arrived.;
Leave this problem to the Immortals.${prompt};
A soulflayer in the early stages of development has been sighted in several sections of the undersea ruins.${prompt};
${name-player}.;
You are charged with the elimination of this threat.${prompt};
Do not underestimate this creature. Even at this stage of growth, it likely possesses a higher intellect and greater command of magic than you.${prompt};
This briefing is over.;
Now go!${prompt};
Wasn't that one of the new recruits?${prompt};
I believe so.;
Can ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] withstand the truth...?${prompt};
We will soon find out.;
If ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] cannot survive this duty, then so be it.;
The weak will be destroyed.${prompt};
An easy thing to say.${prompt};
We must consider the possibility for a third stage of development...${prompt};
A third stage?${prompt};
Hahaha...;
Who is responsible for this failure in the first place?${prompt};
...${prompt};
When a problem arises, all you can do is talk in circles.;
Are you good for nothing more than empty debate?${prompt};
If you fear the truth will be revealed, all we need do is destroy it like the beast it is.${prompt};
Even should we experience transformations, we will not allow the Empress and the Empire to suffer for it.${prompt};
That has always been, and always will be, our only concern...${prompt};
The symbol of chaos...;
You doubt your decision to walk the path.;
Joy, regret, illusion, fiction, and fact...;
All are part of your future...${prompt};
In the depths of an ancient ruin, the value of life will be placed on the scales.${prompt};
Hm? Ah, ${name-player}, wasn't it?;
You don't seem to be carrying any papers stamped with that ominous Mark of Zahak...${prompt};
Was there something else you wanted to talk to me about?${prompt};
The other magus pieces?;
You'll be paying for this out of your own pocket, not on the Empire's coin.;
Are you okay with that?${prompt};
Are you okay with that?;
${selection-lines};
Absolutely.;
On second thought...${prompt};
Well, then.;
We have nothing to discuss.${prompt};
Lathuya, I'm heading to the back for a nap.;
Mind the counter.${prompt};
Ah, oh, sure, Boss.${prompt};
Then let's get down to business.;
Without the largess of the Empire behind you, this is going to cost you a fair pile.${prompt};
I have the basic materials on hand, but magus armor also requires some “special” parts.;
Those things I don't always have in stock.${prompt};
How can I put this?;
These parts require a certain level of freshness.;
That's why I'm going to ask you to acquire them.${prompt};
Are you with me so far?${prompt};
Now, as for your measurements, the Empire has already provided me with the figures I need.${prompt};
Huh? How did they get those?;
How should I know? I just make what they ask of me. Otherwise, it's a silent partnership.${prompt};
You're the one who's working for them.;
I'm sure you'll figure it out if you try real hard.${prompt};
Anyway, back to the magus armor. I have a list of the materials needed--all you need to do is pick which piece you want made first.${prompt};
I'm no type of warrior, so it makes no difference to me.;
Everyone has their own style of fighting.${prompt};
That goes double for you blue mages.${prompt};
I suggest you choose the piece you feel you need the most right now.${prompt};
Which piece will you have made?;
${selection-lines};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]}, is it?${prompt};
Have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} made?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
I've changed my mind.${prompt};
Let's see here...;
In addition to the materials, my crafting fee comes to ${number: 2} ${item-given-plurality: 2[2], 1[2]}.${prompt};
Are you certain this is the piece you want?${prompt};
Are you certain?;
${selection-lines};
Let me see the list again.;
That's the one.${prompt};
Right then, I'll get straight to work on the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Bring the special materials as soon as you're able.${prompt};
I'll be in the back, so just hand them over to Lathuya.;
Good day to you.${prompt};
The materials for making the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
Ah, just a moment...${prompt};
According to the list here, we need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.${prompt};
We require customers to pay up front for made-to-order pieces.${prompt};
Please show me the materials first, and then we can settle the payment.${prompt};
Okay...;
Everything seems to be in order.${prompt};
Yes. The payment. Let me just count...${wait-36: 2};
I'll make sure the materials you've brought go directly to the boss.${prompt};
The completion of your order will take some time...;
Would you mind returning to our store a little later?;
A thousand pardons...${prompt};
Thank you.;
Here, please don't lose this.;
(Phew, I get so nervous dealing with customers...)${prompt};
I was wondering when you would show up to collect your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Take a look at that craftsmanship! Isn't it exquisite?${prompt};
Another job well done.;
There's nothing like the satisfaction of completing an order.${prompt};
Especially something as special as a piece of magus armor.;
You must be pretty pleased yourself.;
Although your face says, “Why the bizarre collection of materials?”${prompt};
Magus armor is designed to bring your combat to a new level.${prompt};
But it also fulfills the role of preventing any unwanted...changes.${prompt};
Blue magic is a powerful force.;
It places an enormous stress on the body of the practitioner.;
You've been accepted into the Immortals--I'm sure you understand what that means.${prompt};
This armor envelops the energy coursing through you, and reduces the burden that blue magic places on your physical form.${prompt};
That is the principal role of magus armor.${prompt};
But it is not one hundred percent certain.;
Considering the path you've chosen to walk, you'll find out what I'm talking about whether you like it or not.;
Sooner or later.${prompt};
Phew.;
All this serious talk can really tire a man out. Let me know if you decide to have the other pieces made.;
And don't forget your coin purse.${prompt};
I'm headed to the back for a rest.;
Lathuya, you know what to do.${prompt};
Enjoy!${prompt};
Well, you didn't waste any time.;
Can't you let a man get some rest in between orders?${prompt};
I shouldn't complain, I suppose.;
Without my loyal customers, I'd be forced to send Lathuya into the mines.;
Just a little joke.${prompt};
You know the deal here, so I won't go into any lengthy explanations. You tell me which piece you want, and I'll list up the materials we'll need.${prompt};
I was wondering when you would show up to collect your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Take a look at that detail! Isn't it incredible?${prompt};
Another job out of the way.;
There's nothing like the happy exhaustion you feel after completing an order.${prompt};
Lathuya, I'm headed--${prompt};
...to the back for a nap?${prompt};
You got it.;
Take care of yourself, ${name-player}.;
I wouldn't want to lose one of my best customers.${prompt};
You're here for your last piece of magus armor?;
Of course you are. Not many people drop by just for a chat.${prompt};
Although I will miss your charming conversation once this is done. Look at me, I'm tearing up.${prompt};
What's that?;
The head piece?;
I wouldn't worry about that. The Empire has already put in the order for you.${prompt};
How it'll find its way into your hands is anybody's guess, but at least you know I was the one to make it.${prompt};
(Earning it will be entirely up to you...)${prompt};
Time for shop talk.${prompt};
The last piece I can make for you is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt};
Probably the last coins I ever take from you.${prompt};
Here to collect your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
I'm sorry, but I really can't help but admire my own brilliance.${prompt};
Now I'll finally have you out of my hair for good.;
It's like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.;
To be honest, you blue mages are a little creepy.${prompt};
Do you remember what I told you about the principal role of magus armor?;
It's alright, don't blow a blood vessel if you can't recall.${prompt};
That just means that it wasn't important enough to you to remember.${prompt};
Life is short.;
Especially for someone in your profession, or so I hear.${prompt};
Keep moving forward, and try not to look back.;
I hope you manage to keep a good grip on who you are.${prompt};
See you around, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I have your ${item-singular: 0[2]} ready here for you.;
I'm sure you'll look quite impressive, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I honestly have no idea what the boss was talking about.;
I still have a long way to go...${prompt};
Excellent timing, ${name-player}.;
You have been appointed as my second in a special operation charged to the Immortals.${prompt};
The operation details are on a need-to-know basis.;
You will be informed of the objective before we depart.${prompt};
Once you are prepared, bring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and present yourself at the Imperial Whitegate.${prompt};
The symbol of ambition...;
Stand once more before the white gate of nobility.;
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is the key.;
The key to untold glory...${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is confirmed.${prompt};
Our objective lies within the city of Mamook.;
It is time to begin our assault on the Jade Sepulcher.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} is torn...${prompt};
You're an adventurer, right? It's so obvy-wobvious. As you can probably guess, I'm also not from around here.${prompt};
The name's Fochacha. I came here from Windurst with my son so I could sharpy-warp up my cooking skills! I'm already a veteran, and I wanted to see just what I could do.${prompt};
My son is at the port now picking up cooking ingredients that have just arrived from Windurst.${prompt};
He should be back anytime now!${prompt};
Oh, speaking of ingredients, you've got to try my cooking at least once and let me know what you thinky-wink!${prompt};
Mom! Mom!;
Someone ran off with the ingredients!${prompt};
They've been stolen? And you didn't try to stop them? Who could perpetrate such a vile-wile act?${prompt};
Well...${prompt};
Hold it right there, kid.;
They call me “Serpenttongue Maudadt,” and I'll be taking those groceries.${prompt};
Now hand them over!${prompt};
Guhahaha. Gwahahaha～!!!;
カメラ用の台詞後で消します。${prompt};
And then that creepy-weepy Galka took off with our groceries!${prompt};
I've seen that Galka before! He was saying something to me about handing over groceries, too...${prompt};
He didn't stick around very long after a tasty-waste of my Hundred Fists, though!${prompt};
So you just let him run off with our groceries and came crying to me? And you call yourself my son?${prompt};
I didn't cry! I would never cry!;
...I just ran away, without crying.${prompt};
That's beside the point! Now off with you!${prompt};
Get those groceries back, or else...${wait-36: 2};
...feel the wrath of my Hundred Fists!${prompt};
Yipe!${prompt};
Anyway, we had better get those groceries back. Dearie me.${prompt};
If you want to know where my son is, he's probably at the teahouse. Gourmets just lovey-wove to gather there and chat about the latest culinary trends. That rotten Galka is sure to be there, too.${prompt};
Well hello, adventurer.;
We are called the “Epicureans”--devotees to mastering the art of culinary delight.${prompt};
Our leader goes by the moniker “Serpenttongue Maudadt.” Do you know of him?${prompt};
I find it hard to believe that someone does not know of Serpenttongue Maudadt. You are aware of the fact that the rulers of Aht Urhgan are named after serpents, yes?${prompt};
Serpenttongue Maudadt rules over Aht Urhgan's cuisine.${prompt};
But enough of that.;
What do you think of my cooking? This fish put up quite a fight before I reeled him in.${prompt};
Why, Qutiba, I only expect the best from your superb fishing skill. But I doubt you could surpass my gardening talents. These vegetables could only grow with my perfect, subtle combination of crystals and patience.${prompt};
Greetings, boss!${prompt};
Geheheh.;
How're you guys coming along?${prompt};
Oh, Qutiba...nice fish! That's a legendary catch!${prompt};
And fresh vegetables from Ulamaal! Fantastic!${prompt};
Geheheh.;
I've done pretty well myself. I've got some things from Windurst, here...${prompt};
Hold it right there!;
How dare you steal my mom's groceries!${prompt};
Return them at once!${prompt};
Geheheh. What now, kid? You mean to say that you didn't give these to me out of the goodness of your heart?${prompt};
Don't tell me he's done it again...;
When it comes to food, the boss just loses his head.${prompt};
Boss, I really wish you'd stop this. After all, we're the ones who are going to have to go apologize later.${prompt};
Geheheh. What're you gonna do about it, kid? Finders keepers, right?${prompt};
Hey boss, why don't you clean your ears out?;
You're dragging the name “serpent” through the mud, you know.${prompt};
!!${prompt};
You guys are a bunch of weirdos!;
I don't care if you've got a hundred-wundred snakes or even lizards! 'Cuz I've got me an adventurer here! Prepare to be vanquishized, evildoers!${prompt};
Geheheh. You've gotta be kidding...kid.${prompt};
Fine, you can have your lousy groceries.${prompt};
Later.${prompt};Plus tard.${prompt}
Where are you going now, boss?${prompt};
I'm going to pick up a shipment of ingredients at the port. I'll be back soon.${prompt};
That hairy meanie used up half of the food already! Ohhh, he really makes my blood boil!${prompt};
What should I do? If Mom finds out, she'll turn me into a bretzel!${prompt};
I got it! And it just might work!${prompt};
It's always us who has to apologize for the boss's actions. I don't know what to do about him.${prompt};
Howdy-wowdy.;
Topok still isn't back yet.${prompt};
Nice timing! Here he comes.${prompt};
Check it out! I got the groceries back!${prompt};
Well, you certainly sound confident. But I know you had help from this adventurer here. What a wimpy-fimpy thing to do!${prompt};
Huh?;
If you were watchin', then why didn't you helpy-welp me out, too?${prompt};
What did you say!?${prompt};
Nothin'. Nothin' at all!${prompt};
Wait just a moment, now.${prompt};
Look at this beautiful dish! Eat up! Eat up! Don't leave a crumb, and let me know how it was!${prompt};
Well, well. ${wait-36: 1};
What an...interesting dish.${prompt};
Mmm...yummy.${prompt};
But still not good enough for me!${prompt};
See ya around. Geheheh!${prompt};
Ohhh, just wait'll I get my hands on you...!;
He just gobbled everything up!${prompt};
I'm very sorry, but these are all I have left. They're yours.${prompt};
Well, now that I have the ingredients, I had better get to work! I won't stop until I make every last person's stomach here groany-woan with my gastronomic delights! Ehehehe!${prompt};
I remember you, adventurer.;
Would you happen to have seen our boss lately?${prompt};
To tell the truth, he's been missing since he left to pick up his shipment at the port.${prompt};
I wonder if he hasn't decided to sail off to some other land...${prompt};
No, he gets seasick too easily for that.${prompt};
I guess that's ruled out, then.${prompt};
But you know, Ulamaal...${prompt};
What? Have you got any clues?${prompt};
Actually, there's something that's been bothering me.${prompt};
It can't be...;
Could you be wondering about food that's disappeared right before your eyes?${prompt};
What!?;
It's happened to you, too?${prompt};
I knew it. It must be the boss's doing.${prompt};
You think so, too? But what if he's in some kind of trouble?${prompt};
The boss himself is trouble. That guy is a handful.${prompt};
Well, we do have an adventurer right here...;
Do you think you could help us find the boss?${prompt};
Oh yes, please help us!;
When you take us out of the kitchen, we're like fish out of water! And Al Zahbi is so big... It gives me goosebumps just thinking about looking for one person among the throngs of people out there!${prompt};
Help out?;
${selection-lines};
All right. Fine.;
No way. Grow a spine!${prompt};
How heartless...;
Please! Oh, please help us!${prompt};
You, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], are a kind soul. Well then, I guess that wraps it up! Good luck with the search!${prompt};
Well, the boss is a master culinarian after all, so I'm sure you'll find him somewhere where there's food.${prompt};
Speaking of which, I think there's a chef from Windurst somewhere in Aht Urhgan Whitegate. Maybe you can get some information from her.${prompt};
Well, hello there.;
You're looking chipper today.${prompt};
Hey.;
You can think of a better greeting than that! Where are your manners?${prompt};
Have you even said “thank you” to this adventurer after all you've put ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] through?${prompt};
Yeah yeah, thanks.${prompt};
Sorry for my son's poor manners. I raised him to know better.${prompt};
Anyway, did you need anything?${prompt};
What?;
That giant pumpkin-head Galka has gone missing?${prompt};
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen the oaf since he stole our groceries...${prompt};
I know what happened to that pumpkin head. He disappeared!${prompt};
Disappeared? What do you meany-wean by that?${prompt};
I mean what I said! He disappeared! Just like a ghost--whoosh! And he was gone!${prompt};
If this is your doing...${prompt};
I didn't do nothin'! The food tastes the same, don't it? It smells the same, don't it?${prompt};
I knew it... You better come clean, boy!${prompt};
That oversized pumpkin head used half the food up already, so I just made it again! All I did was synthesize a few...${prompt};
Synthesize? Don't tell me you've been dabble-wabbling in alchemy!?${prompt};
How dare you start alchemy behind my back again!${prompt};
No matter the reason, using alchemy to create your ingredients only displays your lack of skill as a chef!${prompt};
L-leave me alone!${prompt};
I never wanted to learn cooking in the first place!${prompt};
You never told me that.${prompt};
Yes I did! I did! You just never listened!${prompt};
Either way, anyone who uses alchemy in cooking is no son of mine!${prompt};
And I don't need no mama that won't let me do alchemy!${wait-36: 2};
I'm leaving!${prompt};
Why would he want to do alchemy anyway?;
What's so exciting about a bunch of fuddy-duds doing hocus-pocus?${prompt};
Maybe I was a little too harsh.;
I've never seen that kiddy-wid get so serious about anything...${prompt};
What d'you want? I know you saw me fight with my mom, so just leave me alone!${prompt};
Mom's always been like that. All she ever cares about is cooking, cooking, cooking!${prompt};
She thinks that alchemy is boring compared to cooking, but she doesn't know nothin'!${prompt};
I think alchemy is awesome! I like it so much that I'm even studying it on my very own!${prompt};
I thought everything was gonna turn out well...;
The effects of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} should have worn off by now...but I measured the recipe wrong!${prompt};
He's gonna be invisible forever! And it's all my fault!${prompt};
If that pumpkin head hadn't eaten it, it coulda been you, too!${prompt};
I'm really sorry!${prompt};
We gotta get him back to normal!${prompt};
I've been asking around ever since the pumpkin head disappeared.${prompt};
Someone told me that a ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is growing in the Wajaom Woodlands.${prompt};
It's invisible, but occasionally someone finds one!${prompt};
One person who harvested a berry ate it on the spot...${prompt};
His invisibility suddenly went away, and a bunch of scary monsters attacked him!${prompt};
That fruit probably does other stuff too, but I bet it could also turn our pumpkin-head friend back.${prompt};
Could you please, pretty-please, bring me that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I went looking for it as soon as I heard, but I couldn't find it anywhere! I bet you could, though, 'cuz you look really strong!${prompt};
In the meantime, I'm going to try to lure that Galka in with some yummy-smelling food.${prompt};
If I find him, I'll bring him to the teahouse where his friends are. Let's meet there, 'kay?${prompt};
Remember, meet at the teahouse!${prompt};
That son of mine!;
I found out he's been secretly hoarding ${item-plural: 0[2]} at the port.${prompt};
I wonder what that little rascally-wascal is up to now...${prompt};
I've already heard from Topok-Hippok...${prompt};
You went to the forest to bring back a ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to save the boss.${prompt};
It looks like Topok is here, too.${prompt};
Where is the boss?${prompt};
Qutiba, Ulamaal... Sorry for worrying you.${prompt};
Boss? Is that really you?${prompt};
He was all over the ${item-singular: 0[2]} I cooked! I had to stock a lot of meat broth to make it that juicy...${prompt};
Oh! You found the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! I knew you looked strong!${prompt};
Thanks so much!;
Now we can turn this big oaf back to normal!${prompt};
Now hold on just a second there... I have to squeeze the juice out...${prompt};
Okay, it's ready!;
Drink it all in one gulp, and we'll be able to see you again!${prompt};
Gehee!;
Ouch, it burns! My body feels like it's on fire! I'm...I'm melting!!!${prompt};
Boss! Are you okay!?${prompt};
Geheheh. Just a little joke, kids. I've never felt better!${prompt};
Boss, I'm so glad you're okay!${prompt};
Thanks, kid.${prompt};
Ahhh!;
Where's the pumpkin!?${prompt};
Oh, my hat? It looks like I've lost it somewhere...${prompt};
Boy, am I hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat! Geheh!${prompt};
So that's what he really looks like...${prompt};
Mom!${prompt};
I saw everything, Son. Well done.${prompt};
You better study alchemy properly from now on so you don't maky-wake the same mistake again!${prompt};
Y-you mean you're really gonna let me study alchemy?${prompt};
It's your life. You can do whatever you want.${prompt};
Heheh.;
Mom, I'm sorry for bein' a bad kid.${prompt};
I still wanna help you with cooking while I study alchemy!${prompt};
Oh!;
I'm so happy. Could these be...tears? I-I think I'm gonna cry...${prompt};
Or not.;
Had you fooled there for a second, though, didn't I?${prompt};
Um, sorry to interrupt such a touching moment, but...${prompt};
Would you like to join the “Epicureans”?${prompt};
Our gourmet society will turn you into a new woman! Our priorities are eating, cooking, eating, gardening, eating, gardening, and...oh, did I mention eating?${prompt};
Well, usually they leave out gardening, but I think it's worth mentioning.${prompt};
I'm the master of gardening here. If you want to know what's most important in gardening, I'd have to say “earth.” A wise man once said, “Seek ye the chosen ground, and ye shall be greatly rewarded.” That was in the year...${prompt};
Okay, Ulamaal. We get the point.;
Anyway, I'm Qutiba, and I tirelessly devote both day and night to the development of new recipes.${prompt};
We would love to incorporate your Windurstian cuisine, as well.${prompt};
Oho, I see you can't resist my superior abilities. Do I have a choice? I suppose I'll join!${prompt};
Topok, I see a lot of potential in you, too. Won't you join me in developing new recipes?${prompt};
M-m-me!?;
Um...if you can use me, sure.${prompt};
It looks like our numbers are increasing.;
Welcome to the club, Fochacha and Topok.${prompt};
A hearty welcome into the Epicureans...${prompt};
Thanks.${prompt};
Thank you. I can't wait to learny-wearn about Near Eastern cuisine from everyone!${prompt};
It's time to return home for now, though.${prompt};
You also have our thanks.${prompt};
Please accept this small gift for your services.${prompt};
We've been thinking about what to get for you...${prompt};
And we decided that this would be useful on your adventures.${prompt};
Come again anytime you want to taste test our dishes!${prompt};
準備中よ。${prompt};
準備中だ。${prompt};
準備中だねぇ。${prompt};
We can't have you thinking that the Epicureans just take and take and never give anything in return, now can we?${prompt};
So as a token of our appreciation for your help, we've decided to let you know one of the recipes from our “Super-Secret Recipe Cookbook”!${prompt};
But come to think of it, we taught you one just moments ago! If we handed out our secret recipes left and right, they wouldn't be a secret anymore, now would they?${prompt};
I'll teach you whatever recipe strikes me at the moment. Are you ready?${prompt};
Learn a secret recipe?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please!;
Not interested.${prompt};
Oh? Well, just ask if you ever want to know!${prompt};
That's the spirit!;
All right, here goes... I'm going to teach you the recipe for...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
We'd like to show our appreciation for your help by teaching you one of our special recipes.${prompt};
The list of recipes we have created is quite long, but Ulamaal would like to keep them secret, so I will have to give them out bits at a time.${prompt};
Not much time has passed since I told you the last recipe... I'm sorry, but please wait a bit longer.${prompt};
Learn a secret recipe?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please!;
Not now.${prompt};
A shame... I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to repay you for your kindness. Just ask anytime you would like a recipe!${prompt};
Listen closely, now.;
I'm going to teach you the recipe for...oh yes, this is a good one...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Are you ready? Here goes...;
All right, got your ink and parchment ready? Here goes...;
Are you ready? Here goes...;
First, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
All right, got your ink and parchment ready? Here goes...;
First, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Then you only need two ingredients--${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. A piece of cake, right?${prompt};
Then, just mix together ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and voila! Simple as melon pie, right?${prompt};
Are you ready? Here goes...;
All right, got your ink and parchment ready? Here goes...;
You also must have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
You'll have to use four ingredients for this one--${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, there are more...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!${prompt};
Ah, you'll also need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!${prompt};
Oh, there are more...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt};
Ah, you'll also need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt};
...And last, but not least, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}! I know that's a lot, but just wait until you taste it!${prompt};
I'm sorry, I nearly forgot the last ingredient...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}! That should be all. It's quite a lot, but it should be worth it just to see the look on the person's face who takes the first bite!${prompt};
So what do you think? Did you write that all down? Now all that's left is to try it out!${prompt};
It's all up to you now! Give it your best shot!${prompt};
Anyway, now you know how to make it, but I'm afraid you don't have enough skill...${prompt};
Ah, but then again...${prompt};
You could always have someone else make it for you. It's a secret recipe, though, so make sure to ask someone you can trust.${prompt};
Unfortunately, you don't seem to have enough skill to make it...${prompt};
Do you have any friends who can cook? Perhaps you can ask them to help.${prompt};
Ulamaal wants to keep the recipes a secret, but I personally would like as many people as possible to enjoy Near Eastern cuisine.${prompt};
I think it may be rather difficult for you to do if you have no experience in making confections...${prompt};
This recipe is quite difficult if you have no experience making confections.${prompt};
I'm doing my very-wery best to learn Near Eastern cooking. There are ponzes and ponzes of ingredients here that you just don't see in Windurst. I've got a lot of room to grow as a chefy-wef.${prompt};
Also, Topok is currently studying at the Alchemists' Guild, starting from the basics. I'm gonna work hard and become the besty-west mom around!${prompt};
Oh, there are more...${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and 2 ${item-plural: 2[2]}!${prompt};
Ah, you'll also need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and 2 ${item-plural: 2[2]}!${prompt};
You are now a member of Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}You now have access to a “Mog Locker.”${prompt};
Abquhbah!;
You obtain ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
You...you...${prompt};
Cacaroon got cheeep info, ya?;
Yooo got big gil? Cacaroon got big info!${prompt};
Mercenary ${choice-player-gender}[maaan/laaady], look for Elvaan? With shiny shiny armor?${prompt};
Mercenary ${choice-player-gender}[maaan/laaady], Cacaroon like things that go “clink clink,” ya?${prompt};
Do you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not on me...${prompt};
Ohohoroon!;
Trade? Yooo trade to Cacaroon, ya?${prompt};
Cheeep info!;
Cacaroon only need one thing that go “clink clink,” ya?${prompt};
No? Well, Cacaroon like other types of “clink clink.”${prompt};
Do you have 1000 gil?;
${selection-lines};
I guess...;
Not for you!${prompt};
Cheeep info!;
Cacaroon only need 1000 gil, ya?${prompt};
Ohohoroon?;
Cacaroon need “clink clink” or mercenary ${choice-player-gender}[maaan/laaady] get no big info.;
Maybe yoo come back later?${prompt};
Very shiny shiny, ya?${prompt};
Cacaroon will never forget shiny shiny Elvaan.${prompt};
Shiny shiny Elvaan will come back to Cacaroon with “clink clink”!${prompt};
I seem to recall talk of the Shararat Teahouse becoming a popular gathering place for visitors to Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Why not start your path to enlightenment there?${prompt};
Remember to take your medicine in small doses... Sometimes you can get a little too much of a good thing!${prompt};
Welcome, welcome!;
Flavor your meals with Malfud's ingredients!${prompt};
Flour! Flooour! Corn! Rice and beans! Get your rice and beans here! If you're looking for grain, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
Drawn in by my shop's irresistible aroma, were you?;
How would you like some of the Near East's famous skewers to enjoy during your journeys?${prompt};
Looking for undentable shields? This shop's got the best of 'em! These are absolute must-haves for a mercenary's dangerous work!${prompt};
Buy your goods here...or you'll regret it!${prompt};
Some fish to savorrr while you enjoy the sights of Aht Urhgan?${prompt};
How about a souvenir for back home? There's nothing like dried dates to remind you of good times in Al Zahbi!${prompt};
Welcome!;
Fill all your destructive needs with my superb weaponry! No good mercenary goes without a good weapon!${prompt};
Good day!;
If you want to live long, you'll buy your armor here.${prompt};
Magic scrolls!;
Get your magic scrolls here!${prompt};
Why not sit back a spell and enjoy the rich aroma and taste of a cup of chai?${prompt};
There's nothing like the mature taste and luxurious aroma of coffee... Would you like a cup?${prompt};
All the fishing gear you'll ever need, here in one place!${prompt};
Welcome to the Alchemists' Guild.;
We open ourselves to the hidden secrets of nature in order to create wonders. Are you looking to buy one of them?${prompt};
Only members of the Alchemists' Guild have the vision to create such fine products... Would you like to purchase something?${prompt};
Beyond this gate lies the Commoners' Ward.;
The area is plagued by the frequent appearance of beastmen. Take care not to meet your demise at their hands, would you?${prompt};
The walls built to protect Al Zahbi from the beastmen have been reduced to rubble in several places by the endless waves of attacks. We cannot trust in them to keep us safe any longer.${prompt};
This is the Commissions Agency.;
If you are a mercenary looking for work, you have come to the right place.${prompt};
Welcome to the Chamber of Passage.;
You must have permission from the Imperial Army if you want to use the runic portal inside.${prompt};
This is Walahra Temple.;
Our doors are always open to those who seek knowledge.${prompt};
Ahead lies the Imperial Ward.;
Only citizens of the Empire and those granted consent by the Empress may enter.${prompt};
This is Victory Gate, built in commemoration of former Emperor Ulthalam's subjugation of the beastman hordes.${prompt};
No matter the size of the crowd, a trained Imperial guard can spot a suspicious character at a hundred yalms.${prompt};
Ahead you can find a secret passage that will lead you to a hidden fortress in Bhaflau Thickets.${prompt};
Ahead you can find a passage used for secret envoys and ambush troops.;
The door at the end of the passage leads to a hidden fortress in the Wajaom Woodlands.${prompt};
You're an adventurer, aren't you?${prompt};
You look pretty strong, too...${prompt};
To tell the truth, I've got a personal request... Would you like to hear it?${prompt};
Help him out?;
${selection-lines};
Sure.;
Not now.${prompt};
Oh, thank you!${prompt};
Oh well, I'm not going to force you into anything. Just let me know if you change your mind.${prompt};
Anyway, I'm sure you've noticed that Al Zahbi isn't very peaceful...${prompt};
We're doing our best to ensure the residents' safety, but there are simply too many lawbreakers to handle...${prompt};
There are always problems coming in by the bucketload, but among them...${prompt};
The other day, a guy named Duuruhn went missing while undergoing an investigation of the infamous “Two Horn.”${prompt};
You've never heard of Two Horn?;
Two Horn's the leader of a gang of hot-blooded hooligans...${prompt};
I've heard frightening things...that Two Horn is a Galka as big as a Troll, and hefts an enormous two-handed axe...${prompt};
Anyway, they're all just rumors, and no one actually knows who Two Horn really is.${prompt};
Duuruhn was supposed to be investigating the matter, but all contact with him has been broken off since yesterday.${prompt};
We sent his friend Ahtuuzah after him not long ago, but...${prompt};
What's happened? Are you all right!?${prompt};
It's no use...;
I followed one of Two Horn's henchmen as far as Mamook, but they caught on...${prompt};
They caught me off guard...${prompt};
This is terrible...;
Did you manage to catch a glimpse of Two Horn?${prompt};
I did...manage that. Two Horn is...${prompt};
Is...?${prompt};
A Mamool Ja...an...absolutely terrifying Mamool Ja...${prompt};
Mamool Ja?${prompt};
After this much time has passed, Duuruhn must be...${prompt};
No, I refuse to believe it. We must hurry.${prompt};
Adventurer, this is the task I lay before you. Please investigate this matter.${prompt};
Unfortunately, I think this may be the toughest problem we have ever faced...${prompt};
It would be wise to stop by the information center before you go. The Qiqirn who works there may have some useful information.${prompt};
And remember, this is top secret.${prompt};
No one must know that a soldier of the Imperial Army was done in by the Mamool Ja...${prompt};
I wish you luck, adventurer.${prompt};
You made it back alive?${prompt};
H-how was it?${prompt};
What?;
Two Horn was nothing more than a rumor?${prompt};
So it was just a regular Mamool Ja...and Duuruhn is still missing...${prompt};
That's a disappointment...;
Thanks for your work, though.${prompt};
Something's not sitting quite right with me, though...;
Oh well. As long as you've taken care of the Mamool Ja, that should be enough.${prompt};
Please accept my thanks.;
I hope to have your assistance again if anything arises.${prompt};
Bask in the brilliance of Victory Gate. Nothing better represents the glory of the Empire!${prompt};
The information center is located to the south, in Stoneserpent Square.${prompt};
Welcome to the resplendent Imperial Whitegate.;
Commoners are denied entry.${prompt};
The Seagull Phratrie's headquarters are said to be located somewhere on Arrapago Reef, but we have yet to pinpoint their exact location.${prompt};
Greetings...;
I see you have been drawn in by the spectacle of my massive magical aura...;
Do not be embarrassed. You are not the first.${prompt};
Perhaps I shall bless you with a demonstration?;
I can snatch you up in an eldritch embrace and transport you to a far-off land.;
How does Jeuno sound?${prompt};
But I must have a tribute to match my brilliance...;
Ah yes, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} would be perfect!${prompt};
There is no hurry--the stream of time shall wait for one such as I.;
When you are prepared, trade me the treasure I ask for and you will find yourself whisked to the center of Jeuno in a twinkling...${prompt};
I see you have brought me my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Your tribute has bought you a first-class ticket to the Duchy of Jeuno!${prompt};
Prepare yourself for the height of teleportation excellence!;
That smell...;
You reek of amateur sorcery.${prompt};
It seems my superior services have been spurned for back-alley parlor tricks.${prompt};
I'll thank you to take that offensive stink elsewhere.${prompt};
I see you have developed a fondness for my mystical magnificence.${prompt};
Again, you come to me.;
You can never forget the enchanted exhiliration that accompanies a top-class teleportation...${prompt};
You are a slave to my superlative spellcraft.${prompt};
And since you find me in high spirits this day, I will even consent to transport you to the nation of your allegiance.${prompt};
There is no hurry--the stream of time shall wait for one such as I.;
When you are prepared, trade me the treasure I ask for and you will find yourself instantly whisked to the center of your destination...${prompt};
Have you decided the destination for this intoxicating transit?${prompt};
Your destination?;
${selection-lines};
The Duchy of Jeuno.;
Nation of allegiance.${prompt};
I see you have brought me my ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
Your tribute has bought you a first-class ticket to ${choice: 1}[the Kingdom of San d'Oria/the Republic of Bastok/the Federation of Windurst]!${prompt};
DEBUG:${number: 2}${prompt};
You have something you want delivered?${prompt};
Parcel delivery.;
I am at your service.${prompt};
You are a mercenary from Salaheem's Sentinels, aren't you?${prompt};
This is just between me and you, but there are certain jobs that they don't even trust the Commissions Agency with. Would you be interested?${prompt};
What you will be doing is extremely straightforward.${prompt};
Go to a designated area and annihilate the enemy.${prompt};
I don't know what the Imperial Army seeks to gain from this, and I don't ask. I'm just a middleman, nothing more.${prompt};
I can determine whether or not you are suitable for a job based on your Imperial Standing...${prompt};
Well, well...;
Um... Let's just pretend you never met me, all right? Fate permitting, we'll meet again someday when you're ready.${prompt};
If you think you can handle it and you're willing to sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing, I have a number of jobs for you to attempt.${prompt};
Which would you like to accept?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Is that so? Too bad... Well then, please forget you ever met me.${prompt};
Okay. Your Imperial Standing has decreased some, just like I told you it would.${prompt};
Here, you'll need this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
This will get you through to the Jade Sepulcher, Navukgo Execution Chamber, and Talacca Cove.${prompt};
There is no need to inform me whether you succeed or fail. You will receive your reward on site.${prompt};
Safe travels!${prompt};
Hey, hey... What are you doing, running off from a job? Get back out there!${prompt};
You might be interested in me, but I'm not interested in you. Sorry.${prompt};
I can't give you a job like that with your Imperial Standing. Forget about it, all right?${prompt};
I don't have any offers for you at the moment, but I'll let you know when something comes up.${prompt};
I'm Nadee Periyaha, the mercenary! I used to live in Nashmau.${prompt};
Oh, don't tell me...you've met me there before?${prompt};
I started to pick up Qiqirn ways when I was there. It can make life difficult, so you should be careful too!${prompt};
There are many Qiqirn even in this town... Don't let your guard down, or yooo could end up speaking slooowly just like they dooo.${prompt};
...Oh no! I didn't do it again, did I!?${prompt};
Mamoook very spoooky place. Cacaroon never want go there.${prompt};
Welcome to Walahra Temple. Our doors are always open to those seeking knowledge.${prompt};
Our sanctuary is the resting place of the Gordeus--that which holds the answer to all existence on Urhguum...${prompt};
Here you may gaze upon the “Gordeus,” the very embodiment of Sage Walahra's philosophies.${prompt};
Sage Walahra was the founder of the philosophy “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”;
Without a full understanding of those words, one shall never approach the fundamental truth of existence.${prompt};
We spend our days reciting the words of Sage Walahra in an attempt to discover the true meaning behind the philosophy.${prompt};
Now that everyone is off recruiting in the Middle Lands, I've been left alone to deal with President Naja's mood swi...${prompt};
Ah...that is say, it's so quiet with only the two of us.${prompt};
What? Why are you looking at me like that!?${prompt};
Me? Yes, I'm here to answer all your mercenary questions.${prompt};
Is there anything you'd like to know before you get started?${prompt};
What do you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Mercenaries.;
Salaheem's Sentinels.;
The Commissions Agency.;
President Naja.;
Mercenary assessments.;
Salary.;
Nothing right now.${prompt};
Mercenaries are at the mercy of President Na...;
Ah...that is to say, your road to the top depends on your dedication.${prompt};
Once your mercenary rank starts to rise, so will the size of your bonuses!;
(Not that I've seen anyone receive a bonus lately...)${prompt};
You'll make a fortune! Really!;
(“Fortune” is such a relative word, though...)${prompt};
“Salaheem's Sentinels is an upstanding mercenary company with direct authorization from Her Magnificence, the Empress.${prompt};
High salary. Top-class benefits.;
Transportation allowance negotiable. Company dorm available.${prompt};
With the right attitude, a monthly salary of 10 million gil is not beyond your reach.${prompt};
Experience a plus.;
On the lookout for adventurers with extensive battle experience.”${prompt};
That's from our company flier. Pretty impressive, don't you think?${prompt};
They're signed by President Naja herself!${prompt};
What?;
You think it's over-the-top?${prompt};
The Commissions Agency is the place where you sign up for all your mercenary missions.;
Talk to one of the employees for a full explanation on the type of work available.${prompt};
You can find the Commissions Agency in Aht Urhgan Whitegate. Head east from Serpentking Square to the Way of the Devout. You can't miss it.${prompt};
Why don't you try going there yourself?;
They're much better at explaining things than I am!${prompt};
I will warn you, though.${prompt};
Think of yourself as a walking advertisement for Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
If you bring shame onto the company, the president will introduce you to her spiky “friend.”${prompt};
An excellent question!;
However, that information is classified. Certainly not suitable for the ears of ${choice: 0}[non-employees/second class privates/first class privates/superior privates/lance corporals/corporals/sergeants/sergeant majors/chief sergeants/second lieutenants/first lieutenants/captains].${prompt};
You want to hear that again?;
Seriously?;
Okay, here goes...${prompt};
Article 1.;
“Follow President Naja's orders without question!”${prompt};
Article 2.;
“Fulfill President Naja's requests without fail!”${prompt};
Article 3.;
“Run President Naja's errands without complaint!”${prompt};
Aside from that...;
It's probably better that you don't know.${prompt};
Oh, by the way, I have the records for your mercenary assessment if you'd like to hear it...${prompt};
...;
At your current pace, you'll be doomed to a meeting with President Naja's spiky “friend.”${prompt};
If you want to dig yourself out of that pit, you've got to hit the Commissions Agency and run up some successful Assault missions....;
(That's the only option left to you...)${prompt};
...;
Hmmm. You seem to be out of the woods as far as being beaten to a pulp goes, but you're still somewhere south of the middle.${prompt};
Hello...;
Seems someone has been a good little mercenary. You have some glowing reports from the Commissions Agency here.;
You've finally pulled yourself up to the borderline between worthless pile of beaten pulp and respectable employee.${prompt};
Let's see now.;Voyons voir maintenant.
A few more successful missions and the president herself might have a word with you. Keep this up and the next mercenary rank is not far off!${prompt};
Hello, hello.;
You'll be hearing from President Naja any day now!${prompt};
(Poor thing, you'll wish you'd stayed a worthless pile of beaten pulp...)${prompt};
You know all there is to know, do you?;
Well then, time to get to work, soldier!${prompt};
A mercenary's pay is completely commission-based--you get out what you put in.${prompt};
If you visit our branch office on the second level of Balrahn Way, you can exchange your Imperial Standing credits for Aht Urhgan currency.${prompt};
Start raking in that cash and enjoy the luxuries it brings.;
Hooray for the mercenary life!;
Ahahaha...hmmm.${prompt};
Hello, isn't that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I wonder if Amutiyaal is recruiting many mercenaries in the Kingdom of San d'Oria...${prompt};
There was a letter from him a while back asking after the health of his “beautiful, little flower.”${prompt};
I don't think he needs to worry about President Naja. Her temper is as feisty as ever!${prompt};
Hello, isn't that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I wonder if Alib-Mufalib is recruiting many mercenaries in the Republic of Bastok...${prompt};
He does tend to take things a little easy.;
(I wish I was brave enough to be like that...)${prompt};
Hello, isn't that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I wonder if Ibwam is recruiting many mercenaries in the Federation of Windurst...${prompt};
I'm sure he's doing just fine though.;
He's always so friendly...${prompt};
Sometimes overwhelmingly so...${prompt};
Hello, isn't that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};
I wonder if Ajithaam is recruiting many mercenaries in the Duchy of Jeuno...${prompt};
I'm a little worried.;
Ajithaam is...;
Ajithaam is...${prompt};
No, no, I'm sure everything is fine...${prompt};
There should be four types of those invitation cards in total.;
Show them to President Naja once you have all four.;
(But don't let her know that I told you...)${prompt};
Ummm, well, okay then!;
I don't usually tell this sort of thing to ${choice: 0}[non-employees/second class privates/first class privates/superior privates/lance corporals/corporals/sergeants/sergeant majors/chief sergeants/second lieutenants/first lieutenants/captains]...${prompt};
(Finally, a chance to pass on some of the gossip I've heard from my colleagues over the years...)${prompt};
Let's just start with one little tidbit, shall we?;
(I wouldn't want to waste all that prime gossip all at once.)${prompt};
President Naja's favorite food is fish.;
(According to Amutiyaal...)${prompt};
And the fish she loves the most is mercanbaligi sashimi.;
(Not the fish mithkabob I was expecting...)${prompt};
Apparently, her best memory is eating raw Gugrusaurus with rock salt and olive oil on a fishing boat.${prompt};
And when she's feeling listless and tired she just likes to roast a whole fish over a fire and eat it right off the stick.${prompt};
(Not that I've ever seen or heard of President Naja lacking energy...)${prompt};
Although, I have heard she can never forget the taste of a freshly caught Bibiki urchin.;
(I wonder if President Naja can swim...)${prompt};
Seawater gives them just the right amount of salty seasoning, apparently.${prompt};
This is just a theory, but I think there's one fish that President Naja loves more than any other...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Abquhbah is staring at ${name-player}'s mercenary badge...;
What do you think it might be?${prompt};
President Naja is only interested in the freshest fish.${prompt};
And she seems to know the names of foods that I've never even heard of.;
(Where is President Naja from originally anyway...?)${prompt};
Oh! Could she be affiliated with the Epicureans in the Shararat Teahouse?;
(I don't even want to think about that!)${prompt};
Oh, yes! A long while ago, someone trying to bribe the president with a freshly caught fish was showered with “spiky affection.”;
(Poor Amutiyaal...)${prompt};
So I suggest you refrain from attempting any spontaneous acts of kindness!${prompt};
The president's ignorance of your existence is bliss!${prompt};
All the things I've seen over the past two years I've pushed away into some dark corner of my mind...${prompt};
I'm only going to tell you things about President Naja that pertain to work!;
(I wouldn't want to waste that prime gossip all at once.)${prompt};
So, ${name-player}.;
Pick a time and I'll tell you what President Naja would be doing.${prompt};
Which time do you choose?;
${selection-lines};
9:00.;
12:00.;
17:00.${prompt};
At 9:00, President Naja is here, conducting the morning meeting.${prompt};
This is when I report the previous day's profits.;
It's also a time for taking attendance and assigning duties.${prompt};
Huh!?;
Does anyone else work here besides me?${prompt};
Why, Ugrihd and Fubruhn, senior employees in the company, are always here in the morning!${prompt};
You can't tell me you've never heard of them!${prompt};
12:00 is President Naja's lunch time.;
She usually eats out...${prompt};
She often lunches with the officials from the Commissions Agency and discusses business.;
(I wish she would invite me occasionally...)${prompt};
President Naja's favorite Shararat Teahouse desserts are ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};
Although, she's so often plagued by thorny problems she rarely has time to sit and enjoy them.${prompt};
At 17:00 the yawning becomes more obvious...;
Then sometimes she suddenly starts to clean her precious morning star.${prompt};
She brushes off the dust, and polishes the head with a cloth soaked in olive oil...${prompt};
The spikes gleam quite spectacularly after she's finished.${prompt};
That always brings a smile to President Naja's face.;
(A frightening sight to see...)${prompt};
All the things I've seen over the past two years I've pushed away into some dark corner of my mind...${prompt};
But it's never healthy to suppress your feelings!${prompt};
So, pick a time, and I'll tell you all about what President Naja would be doing.${prompt};
What time do you choose?;
${selection-lines};
Morning.;
Afternoon.;
Evening.${prompt};
In the morning, President Naja always partakes of 2 ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Naturally, it falls on me to head out and buy them from the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt};
Serving cold coffee is asking for an entire day of dark moods, so I always dash on the way back.;
(I've built up a fair amount of speed over the years!)${prompt};
After lunch, it's time for the president's catnap.;
There's a small room in the back for her private use.${prompt};
It's my job to wake her, but either she sleeps so soundly I can't stir her with the most furious knocking...${prompt};
Or, I find myself ducking from a spike-tipped frenzy!;

In the evening, President Naja often heads out without the slightest warning.;
When that happens, it's usually some time before she returns.${prompt};
Where do you think she goes, ${name-player}?${prompt};
I wonder what causes the stormclouds to pass over our president's almost perpetually sunny disposition...;
(I need to work on my analytical skills...)${prompt};
Do you remember I mentioned that ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} from the Shararat Teahouse are two of President Naja's favorite desserts?${prompt};
It seems a shame that she only gets to enjoy them during stressful business lunches.${prompt};
You see...what I'm trying to say is...${prompt};
Maybe you could show appreciation for your president in a more “substantial” manner.${prompt};
Now that you've reached the rank of Chief Sergeant, I'm sure President Naja will be more than delighted to see how much you value your new position in the company...${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Somethin' on your mind, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Ya say ya wanna show how much ya apprrreciate each and every day you work here?;
Have ya been talkin' to Abquhbah again?${prompt};

${color-alt: 15}Naja Salaheem hands you ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!;

Do you remember the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you delivered to each of the Immortals in the staging areas?${prompt};
Sure you do!;
It was one of the first things President Naja asked you to do when you joined the company.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} contained a fragrance made with a rare oil. This oil is extracted from a berry that only grows in the nation of Zwha.${prompt};
A nation far, far, unbelievably far to the south...${prompt};
Did you know that President Naja originally came from there?;
(I personally had no idea...)${prompt};
She braved the ridiculously long journey to Aht Urhgan, and then founded her own mercenary company--amazing!${prompt};
I have nothing but admiration for our fearless leader!;
But I wonder if there was some other, deeper, reason for her trip...${prompt};
The speculation gets me so excited I can barely sleep at night.;
There must be something you can do for me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I've heard of some interesting cures for insomnia: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, or even ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
President Naja suggests I try ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, although I'd rather not go to those extremes...${prompt};
But if I don't get a decent night's sleep sometime soon, my work will begin to suffer. And then I'll be made to suffer...${prompt};
Please, ${name-player}.;
You have to help me!${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}.;
This should help me drift off in no time.${prompt};
Please accept this small gift for your trouble.${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}!;
No more counting marids for me!${prompt};
Here, maybe this will come in useful in your line of work.${prompt};
Oh! Thank you, ${name-player}!;
My sleepless nights are over!${prompt};
Please accept these gifts from the company supplies!${prompt};
Obtained: ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Ahaha...;
Yes, this will certainly put me to sleep...${prompt};
Come back after sorting your inventory.${prompt};Revenez après avoir trié votre inventaire.${prompt}
I can't keep this to myself any longer...;
President Naja's real name is...Naja Zhwan!${prompt};
That name only belongs to the royal family of the Kingdom of Zhwa.;
Do you realize what this means? Our beloved president is also a princess! Incredible!${prompt};
The Kingdom of Zhwa is an island nation found in the southern seas. Ever since the time of Koja Zhwan, a close friend of Imperial hero Balrahn, successive generations of this remote country have been entrusted with the defense of the Empire's interests.${prompt};
After hearing of the beastman threat to the Empire, President Naja...ahem, Princess Naja...led a force of Zhwan soldiers across the waves to assist the distant capital of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
How this resulted in a princess becoming a president of a mercenary company is anyone's guess...${prompt};
Where did I learn about all this, you ask?${prompt};
Why, I just did what any concerned subordinate would do--I followed her after company hours.${prompt};
Though I wasn't really prepared to see her chatting about the “old days” while she was waited on hand, foot, and finger by three overly-familiar young men...<sniff>...${prompt};
But this secret is so huge it cannot be kept by one man alone!${prompt};
After leading her army to Al Zahbi and being disgusted by the corrupt state of the Imperial Army, President Naja decided to establish her own mercenary company...without any kind of authorization.${prompt};
She was then accused of inciting civil strife by the Immortals! This case escalated into a scandal in which the Kingdom of Zhwa was stripped of its autonomy and the Zhwan royal family was threatened with obliteration.${prompt};
Thankfully, the recently-inaugurated Empress Nashmeira II reduced the Zhwan family's punishment to a suspension of powers, and then formally recognized Salaheem's Sentinels as a legitimate company.${prompt};
But, with matters as they were, President Naja was forced to borrow the capital to fund her mercenary enterprise. The island princess had been disowned by her own family...${prompt};
Our beloved president has certainly seen some hard times. The financial state of Salaheem's Sentinels was in tatters when I first joined the company...${prompt};
However, Her Magnificence would send letters to President Naja expressing her simple hope for the happiness and fortune of all her subjects.${prompt};
Those words inspired our fearless leader to throw all her energy into building the successful business you see today. She may seem rough and uncomprimising at times, but President Naja is not one to forget her obligations.${prompt};
Oh, and I've decided to stop my life of furtive stalking.;
Since the Empress's coronation, President Naja seems to have been freed from her most pressing worries.${prompt};
4;
And the young men she was meeting with at the teahouse? They were retainers from her family estate, asking her to return home.${prompt};
And she refused them, saying she could never leave behind her “prrrecious pawns”.;
Doesn't that make you feel all warm inside!?${prompt};
I hope you have the good sense to keep all this to yourself.;
You wouldn't want to replace that warm and fuzzy feeling with spiky, bludgeoning pain!${prompt};

Sorry, but could you come back later?;
I can't leave my work right now...${prompt};
Welcome to the Automaton Workshop!;
We're working busily-fizzily on automaton research! Well, Ghatsad is, anyway...${prompt};
Hmmm...I can tell by your face.;
Fiercely determined, yet not overconfident. Playful, yet cautious. Yes, you have the look of an exemplary puppetmaster.${prompt};
So you've fought alongside ${entity: 0}, enjoyed the pleasantry of conversation together, and brought joy to the residents of Urhguum with your combined efforts...${prompt};
Excellent, ${name-player}.;
I think you deserve a new frame for your automaton. I can upgrade your model to optimize its efficiency in battle.${prompt};
Of course, I'm not running this workshop for charity. I will require some items from you.${prompt};
First, which frame do you desire?;
The “Valoredge X-900” enhances proficiency in close combat, the “Sharpshot Z-500” specializes in long-range attacks, and the “Stormwaker Y-700” enables its user to command magic spells.${prompt};
Have no fear. Each variety is perfected here at the workshop. I personally guarantee their quality.${prompt};
Which frame do you want?;
${selection-lines};
I don't want a new frame.;
Valoredge X-900.;
Sharpshot Z-500.;
Stormwaker Y-700.${prompt};
The Valoredge X-900 is designed to allow the automaton to engage enemies in close combat with a razor-edged blade.${prompt};
Due to the armor plates that entirely cover the automaton's body, this frame can take a fair amount of damage without a scratch. A blade and shield complement this model quite well. Of the three varieties, the Valoredge X-900 is the most durable.${prompt};
You must bring me ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 9[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 10[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 11[2]} if you want me to start work on this frame.${prompt};
I also require payment in the form of ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
Well? Have you decided that you want the Valoredge X-900?${prompt};
Order the Valoredge X-900?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, this is the one.;
What about the others?${prompt};
Then I will begin the preparations to create the Valoredge X-900. Next, you must bring me the materials and fee that I will need to complete the project.${prompt};
Have you found the materials I need yet? Don't forget--I need ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 9[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 10[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 11[2]}.${prompt};
Also, remember to bring ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]} to cover the costs of production.${prompt};
The Sharpshot Z-500 is designed to allow the automaton to lend support from behind the puppetmaster in the form of carefully aimed crossbow arrows.${prompt};
This model is also characterized by its enhancement of nimble movements, adaptability, and high artificial intelligence. A mechanical crossbow complements this frame well. Of the three frames, the Sharpshot Z-500 can be used the most strategically in battle.${prompt};
Well? Have you decided that you want the Sharpshot Z-500?${prompt};
Order the Sharpshot Z-500?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, this is the one.;
What about the others?${prompt};
Then I will begin the preparations to create the Sharpshot Z-500 frame. Next, you must bring me the materials and fee that I will need to complete the project.${prompt};
The Stormwaker Y-700 was designed to allow the automaton to use magical spells.${prompt};
This model utilizes a type of artificial intelligence that endows the automaton with the ability to recall complex magical spells and determine which incantation is suitable for any given situation. Its headpiece also provides a certain amount of protection from magical attacks. Of the three models, the Stormwaker Y-700 is the most astute.${prompt};
Well? Have you decided that you want the Stormwaker Y-700?${prompt};
Order the Stormwaker Y-700?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, this is the one.;
What about the others?${prompt};
Then I will begin the preparations to create the Stormwaker Y-700. Next, you must bring me the materials and fee that I will need to complete the project.${prompt};
Oh? Well, I'm glad you've taken a liking to the Harlequin model. After all, automatons are designed to respond to their handlers' caring.${prompt};
Oh? Well, I'm glad you've taken a liking to your current model. After all, automatons are designed to respond to their handlers' caring.${prompt};
Decided you want a new frame after all?${prompt};
That should be it for the ingredients. Now all I need is payment in the form of ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]} and I can start work immediately.${prompt};
Thank you. Now I've got everything I need.;
I will order my pupil to start the preparations immediately. Please come back a bit later.${prompt};
You're back early.;
Frames aren't made by synthesis, you know. You wouldn't want a defective product, now, would you?${prompt};
Go have a sip of chai at Shararat Teahouse or something, and try to hold in your excitement a bit.${prompt};
Welcome back.;
The close combat frame is ready. Let's see how it looks on your automaton...${prompt};
I now present...the Valoredge X-900.;
Do you like it? Doesn't it look intimidating?${prompt};
...${wait-36: 2};
I am ${entity: 0}, now equpped with Valoredge X-900. Swear to protect puppetmaster at all costs.${prompt};
Sword as witness!${prompt};
Hahaha.;
It looks like ${entity: 0}'s taken a liking to it, too.${prompt};
You obtain the Valoredge X-900 head and frame!${prompt};
Welcome back.;
The ranged attacker frame is ready. Let's see how it looks on your automaton...${prompt};
I now present...the Sharpshot Z-500.;
Do you like it? Doesn't it look nimble?${prompt};
...${wait-36: 2};
I am ${entity: 0}, now equipped with Sharpshot Z-500. Swear to target and destroy puppetmaster's enemies.${prompt};
My arrows never fail!${prompt};
You obtain the Sharpshot Z-500 head and frame!${prompt};
Welcome back.;
The magical attacker frame is ready. Let's see how it looks on your automaton...${prompt};
I now present...the Stormwaker Y-700.;
Do you like it? Doesn't it look intelligent?${prompt};
...${wait-36: 2};
I am ${entity: 0}, now equipped with Stormwaker Y-700. Swear to use abilities for good of puppetmaster.${prompt};
Now possess power of magic!${prompt};
You obtain the Stormwaker Y-700 head and frame!${prompt};
You can customize the automaton to suit your taste by changing its head and frame.${prompt};
Of course, the automaton looks just fine with its original parts, but mixing things up every now and then can lead to interesting results.${prompt};
You can alter your automaton's abilities and character by equipping attachments.${prompt};
The more attachments you have, the more you can customize ${entity: 0} to suit your fighting style.${prompt};
Hmmm...I can tell by your hands.;
Powerful, yet supple. Dextrous, yet subtle. Yes, you have the look of an exemplary puppetmaster.${prompt};
So you've learned much with ${entity: 0}, shared good times, and even experienced pain together...${prompt};
Excellent, ${name-player}.;
I think you deserve another new frame for your automaton.${prompt};
Hmmm...I can tell by your eyes.;
They give off a calming light, yet a closer look reveals deep wisdom and resolve. Yes, those are the eyes of a phenomenal puppetmaster.${prompt};
So you've dozed in the desolate wilderness with ${entity: 0}, shared injuries in battle, and frolicked through the towns of Urhguum together...${prompt};
Ah...I can tell by your walk.;
The bonds you've formed with ${entity: 0} have begun to change both your body and soul.${prompt};
Excellent, ${name-player}.;
If you wish, I will construct you a new head for your automaton's Stormwaker Y-700 to optimize its efficiency in battle.${prompt};
You are faced with an important decision. Will you have your automaton walk the path of the white mage, or that of the black?${prompt};
What do you wish to order?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing at this time.;
The Soulsoother C-1000.;
The Spiritreaver M-400.${prompt};
The Soulsoother C-1000 head comes equipped with an advanced AI program that emulates the actions of the Empire's top white mages.${prompt};
The Spiritreaver M-400 head has been programmed with a state-of-the-art black mage algorithm that is guaranteed to significantly increase spell processing efficiency.${prompt};
To construct this head I will require ${article} ${item-article: 8[2]} and my usual fee of ${number: 6} ${item-given-plurality: 6[2], 5[2]}.${prompt};
In addition, you will also need to bring me a ${choice: 16}[white/black] mage scroll so I can program its data patterns into the head's control center.${prompt};
If possible, locate ${article} ${item-article: 15[2]}. However, if that proves difficult, ${article} ${item-article: 14[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 13[2]} will suffice.${prompt};
When you have readied all the items and my fee, bring them here and I shall begin my work. However, please understand that programming artificial intelligence is not a simple thing. Many moons may pass before we are able to install your automaton's new head.${prompt};
The turban, the scroll, and the coin. Yes, everything seems to be in order.${prompt};
I shall begin work on your automaton's new head right away. As I mentioned before, programming artificial intelligence can prove remarkably time-consuming. I ask that you stop by every now and then to check on my progress...${prompt};
...and maybe bring a cup of the Empire's finest roast when you do. Ahahaha!${prompt};
I have just begun working on your order's artificial intelligence nodes. The road to completion is still long and winding.${prompt};
I have made much progress in the AI programming, but I still have much spell data to input.${prompt};
Ah, good news, ${name-player}! The craftsman who carves all my automaton heads dropped by yesterday morning with your order. Now I need only insert the control center and make a few minor adjustments. Our journey is almost over.${prompt};
<Yawn......>;
I have had so much work these past weeks... I can barely keep my eyes open, let alone my mind focused...${prompt};
Ah, just what the doctor ordered! Your generosity is much appreciated, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Ah, you have come at a good time, ${name-player}. Your new head is complete!${prompt};
Witness the Soulsoother C-1000--the pinnacle of automaton technology--guaranteed to transform your companion into the perfect protector, the savvy savior, the ever-loyal leecher!${prompt};
Witness the Spiritreaver M-400--the pinnacle of automaton technology--guaranteed to transform your companion into a deadly dealer of damage, a scheming spinner of spells, an unholy harbinger of hexes.${prompt};
Though, whether your automaton will ever realize its potential is completely up to you--its master. Forget this not, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You obtain the Soulsoother C-1000 head!${prompt};
You obtain the Spiritreaver M-400 head!${prompt};
Ah...You seem much more confident.;
You are nearly one with ${entity: 0}.${prompt};
Excellent, ${name-player}.;
If you wish, I will construct you a new head for your automaton's Stormwaker Y-700 to optimize its efficiency in battle.${prompt};
Automatons have it made. It would be nice if we could also just equip an attachment and become a whole new person, wouldn't it?${prompt};
Then maybe he would finally notice me...${prompt};
Oh! I'm sorry. No, you don't need to know about that. I was just talking to myself...<blush>.${prompt};
Wow, you've got your very own automaton!${prompt};
But you need to know that this basic model is like a newborn baby. It can't do anything until you help it grow.${prompt};
Customize it with attachments, and you can finally bring out its true power!${prompt};
But let me warn you...${prompt};
Even if you've acquired an attachment for your automaton, it won't do you any good unless you know how to use it.${prompt};
If you would like to customize ${entity: 0}, you must hand me the attachment you would like to equip.${prompt};
Then I can fit ${entity: 0} with connectors so that you can equip your new attachments.${prompt};
Okay, now that I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, let me just plug in this connector here and...${prompt};
That's it!;
You will have to equip it and experiment for yourself to see what features it adds to your automaton.${prompt};
You can now equip your automaton with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
What's this?;
It looks like I've already fitted your automaton with the connector for that attachment.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}! How kind of you to visit me at my humble studio.;
Just applying the finishing touches to my latest work, here...${prompt};
All I need is--<ahem>--that one part we spoke of, and this beauty will be complete.;
Yes, you should be able to find it around Mount Zhayolm, I'd wager.${prompt};
Any luck hunting down that rare part for me?;
That's a tall order, there.;
Perhaps you should seek out a veteran treasure hunter, or one acquainted with the environs.${prompt};
Phew! Another grueling day at the workshop.;
What's that? You've recovered the part for me?${prompt};
Splendid! I'm just about to head out for the day, so if you could just deliver it to--<ahem>--the agreed-upon location, all should be in order.${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}. I heard that, ah, a certain someone's waiting for an opportunity to thank you in person.;
I was just--<ahem>--going to head over that way myself, so perhaps I'll see you there.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Ghatsad cautiously surveys the room.;
(I tell you, ${name-player}, ever since Lord Razfahd returned, her Majesty has been quite literally bounding about the palace in joy.)${prompt};
(I must confess, it brought a tear to this old Galka's eye as well.)${prompt};
(I did tutor the boy as a child, you know.;
Were it not beyond my station, why, I'd say I think of him almost as a son of my own.)${prompt};
(In any event, we owe you a true debt of gratitude.;
Thank you, ${name-player}.)${prompt};
Orders upon orders! It's all work and no play for the busy puppetcrafter.;
My apologies, but could you return another time?${prompt};
Oh, and ${name-player}...the--<ahem>--business partner of whom we spoke said he's eagerly awaiting your arrival.${prompt};
(A divine receptacle--a marvel of science, born of the centuries-long struggle of our forbears...;
Now we repair it, only to demolish it again like so much scrap metal.)${prompt};
(How foolish we were to presume that we--mere mortals--could wield the power of the divine.;
Still, there must be another way, and we will--no, we must--find it someday.)${prompt};
(Ah, but forgive me, ${name-player}. I'm sure you have more pressing matters to attend than one scientist's idle ramblings.)${prompt};
(We shall call upon you if we have need of your services again.;
Until then, be well.)${prompt};

“Serpent Generals.”;
Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi.;
Astral Candescence with beastmen.;
Empire's current state of defense.${prompt};
“Sanction” is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.${prompt};
Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.${prompt};
When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.${prompt};
Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.${prompt};
But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.${prompt};
You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.${prompt};
You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting “Besieged” under “Region Info.”${prompt};
You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.${prompt};
“Besieged” occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.${prompt};
The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the “Astral Candescence” from the Empire's control.${prompt};
You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.${prompt};
All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.${prompt};
The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders!;
Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.${prompt};
Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.${prompt};
Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.${prompt};
If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.${prompt};
It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!${prompt};
When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.${prompt};
The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.${prompt};
Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.${prompt};
Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.${prompt};
The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!${prompt};
If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!${prompt};
We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.${prompt};
As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set “archaic mirrors” in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.${prompt};
If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} them to an Imperial guard.${prompt};
Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of ${number: 5}. The Imperial capital has seen ${number: 6} ${choice-plurality: 6}[victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of ${number: 7} ${choice-plurality: 7}[time/times].${prompt};
You do not possess the ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Please be aware that you can only recharge ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} once during the period between each Conquest tally.${prompt};
The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is already fully charged.${prompt};
Your ${item-singular: 0[2]} has received ${number: 2} ${choice-plurality: 2}[charge/charges] in exchange for ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. It is now fully recharged.${prompt};

Hey, I haven't seen you around here before. You wouldn't happen to be one of those “adventurers” everyone's been making a fuss over, are you?${prompt};
Me? I'm Saliyahf.${prompt};
I work together with a guy named Wazyih to solve the people of Aht Urhgan's problems.${prompt};
We're like you adventurers, only we don't leave town.${prompt};
Actually, I'm afraid Wazyih's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, so I end up doing all the work.${prompt};
Have you ever met Wazyih before?${prompt};
Lately he's been acting kind of fishy...like he's hiding something, or...${prompt};
S-S-Sa...${prompt};
Saliyahf!${prompt};
Well, speak of the devil!${prompt};
Wazyih, what the hell is wrong with you? Don't surprise me like that!${prompt};
I-I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...${prompt};
Whatever. You'll do it again anyway.${prompt};
Well, give me your report. You were out guarding the streets, right?${prompt};
Th-that's correct, sir. Ummm...well, that is, you see...${prompt};
Out with it already!${prompt};
...I dropped it.${prompt};
Huh? What is it that you dropped? Explain yourself!${prompt};
Ummm...well... This merchant asked me to...${prompt};
Merchant? Oh no, don't tell me you...${prompt};
Well, I know we refused, but she looked like she was really in a bind, so I told her I would deliver it myself...${prompt};
So, anyway, I took her package and headed to the Commoner's Ward...and wouldn't you know it? Beastmen attacked when I got there...and chased me...${prompt};
And when I was running...the package... I-I...I dropped it!${prompt};
...${prompt};
...You idiot!${prompt};
We had already refused, right?${prompt};
And you knew how dangerous the Commoner's Ward is!${prompt};
And you went off alone without consulting me first? What were you thinking!?${prompt};
Not only that, but you even managed to drop the woman's package...${prompt};
You've got a lot of nerve to show your face to me again!${prompt};
B-but...she really needed help...${prompt};
Don't you “but” me! You should have refused!${prompt};
You...you...${prompt};
Never!${prompt};
Ever!!${prompt};

Think about the consequences of your actions!${prompt};

Jumping down from the city walls to stop a fight!${prompt};
Not to mention jumping right into the ocean to retrieve a dropped item...${prompt};
Is there anything you've managed to successfully accomplish alone?${prompt};
All you ever do is get yourself hurt and then come running to me!${prompt};
And just who do you think...${wait-36: 2};
...has to clean up your mess!?${prompt};
I-I'm sorry. I'll just go find...${prompt};
You're missing the point!${prompt};
I've had it! I can't put up with this anymore... We're through, Wazyih!${prompt};
Wh-what?;
Y-you can't mean that, Saliyahf!${prompt};
I've heard enough from you already! The very sight of you makes my blood boil!${prompt};
B-but...w-we...${prompt};
Anyway, our partnership is over! If you're so eager to get your nose into trouble, then get your tail over to Mamook or the Arrapago Reef!${prompt};
Y-you can't mean that...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hmph. Fool...${prompt};
Ah, Saliyahf! There you are! I have a report for you!${prompt};
What's all the fuss about?${prompt};
We've got a big problem on our hands!;
There's a rough and rowdy lot harassing a woman on Balrahn Way!${prompt};
What? An Aht Urhgan woman?${prompt};
Yes! And not only that...the culprits appear to be mercenaries from abroad!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
M-mercenaries...?${prompt};
You're our only hope, Saliyahf! Please, you must save her, or she'll...${prompt};
W-wait a minute! Just...just give me a moment. You go on ahead of me, and I'll be there soon.${prompt};
Um, okay... Please hurry!${prompt};
I've heard mercenaries are pretty strong...${prompt};
Wait, you're an adventurer, right?${prompt};
You heard the man. Let this go, and soon everyone will be suspicious of people from abroad.${prompt};
First, you should go and just make sure everything is okay, all right? Um, I'll be right behind you.${prompt};
Tiyaash mentioned a girl being harassed on Balrahn Way.${prompt};
You should go check it out. Don't worry... I'm right behind you.${prompt};
Oh, hello. I haven't seen you before. Are you an adventurer?${prompt};
My name is Wazyih. Together, Saliyahf and I are the defenders of Aht Urhgan!${prompt};
We're a lot like you adventurers, really, but we only work in town.${prompt};
Actually, I'm not much help to tell the truth. I mean, the other day, I...${prompt};
...Never mind. I doubt you want to hear about that.${prompt};
You should talk to Saliyahf.${prompt};
I think Saliyahf is probably somewhere around Philosopher's Alley...${prompt};
Oh, I remember you...${prompt};
What? A woman is being harassed by mercenaries? I've got to go help her!${prompt};
Ummm... Which way was it again? Ah, I've got to hurry!${prompt};
Who are you and what do you want!?${prompt};
Hohoho, look what we have here. Here I was thinking Aht Urhgan was going to be the pits, but they've got some pretty cute women here, eh?${prompt};
Hey, cutie. Want to show me around town? I promise to properly reward you. Heh heh...${prompt};
Get out of my way! Can't you see I'm in a hurry?${prompt};
...S-stop right this instant!${prompt};
G-get away from her! If you don't...I'm gonna...I'm gonna...${prompt};
Hoho, look what the cat dragged in... You're gonna what?${prompt};
Some hero. Look at him! He's shaking in his sandals!${prompt};
G-get away from her!${prompt};
You don't know much about mercenaries, do ya, kid? Let me teach you a thing or two about us...${prompt};
Eek...ahhh!${wait-animation: 2};

Well, that takes care of that.;
Now, back to our little chat...${prompt};

You were amazing! You must be as strong as Saliyahf. Me, on the other hand...${prompt};
Anyway, I'd better get back. Please come see me later so I can properly thank you.${prompt};
There you are!${prompt};
Thank you so much for earlier. Imeeya was really thankful for what you did.${prompt};
I still haven't made up with Saliyahf... I seem to have made him really angry this time.${prompt};
Both Saliyahf and I were born and raised in this town.${prompt};
You idiot!;
What did you think you were doing with those thugs?${prompt};
B-but... They were stealing from all the shops, saying that this is their town and they can do whatever they want... The shop owners really needed some help...${prompt};
So you decided to pick a fight with them?${prompt};
A smart man keeps his nose out of trouble! Did you think you could take them all on at once? If I hadn't saved you, you'd be feeding the bettas by now!${prompt};
B-but...${prompt};
Saliyahf, do you love this town?${prompt};
What a random question.;
Of course I love this town! I was born and raised here!${prompt};
I love this town too. That's why I've been thinking...${prompt};
You? About what?${prompt};
I want to help out the people who live here.${prompt};
I mean, there are lots of adventurers, right? I want to do something like that... solving people's problems and defending the town from evil.${prompt};
Then everyone would love this town even more...${prompt};
The port, the gates, the fountains, the tea...everything... I want everyone to love this town.${wait-36: 6}${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Saliyahf... Do you want to be partners? We could work together to make Aht Urhgan a better place.${prompt};
I know we could do it!${prompt};
Helping people out, eh?${prompt};
Hmph, whatever. What else am I gonna do with you? Might as well give it a try.${prompt};
And so Saliyahf and I gradually became well-known in Aht Urhgan by helping people out...${prompt};
Everything was going pretty well, until recently...${prompt};
But selling goods in the Commoner's Ward requires far less gil, doesn't it? I wish I could do business there...${prompt};
It's no place for a poor, weak woman like me, though... Oh kind sir, won't you help me out?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Um...isn't it cheaper because of the fact that it's dangerous?${prompt};
So...why don't you just hire a mercenary with the money you saved or go yourself?${prompt};
But Saliyahf...${prompt};
There's an auction house here in Whitegate, you know. There's no need to ask anything of us.${prompt};
But, she...${prompt};
In any case, we refuse. Let's go, Wazyih.${prompt};
Oh, this is terrible. I ordered so many goods just for this...${prompt};
Um... Ma'am?;
If you'd like, I can do it...${prompt};
I couldn't just stand by and watch somebody suffer...so I accepted her offer in secret.${prompt};
But I was attacked by beastmen in the Commoner's Ward and dropped her package...${prompt};
If I could only get the package back and deliver it... Maybe then Saliyahf would forgive me.${prompt};
Are you going to the Commoner's Ward, by any chance? If you find the package, please let me know.${prompt};
I also plan to go look for it myself, but I haven't had a free moment lately... If you happen to be heading that way on some errand, though, I would be very grateful for your help.${prompt};
I think the package dropped somewhere along the edge of the street in the Commoner's Ward.${prompt};
But I was so absorbed in my own escape that I couldn't tell you the exact location... I'm very sorry.${prompt};
Ah, a familiar face.${prompt};
Wazyih? No, I don't know where he is. We're not working together anymore, remember?${prompt};
The fool... He knew he couldn't stand up to those mercenaries, but he went diving in anyway...${prompt};
He's the most reckless pushover I know. Do you realize how difficult it is to work with someone like that?${prompt};
He's always been that way. Jumping in where even I fear to tread...${prompt};
Not that it matters now.${prompt};
Well, back to my rounds.${prompt};
Ugh...${prompt};
It's...you...;
I...I did it again...${prompt};
I went looking for the package...but I got attacked yet again...${prompt};
Don't worry... My injuries aren't serious. I couldn't find the package, though...${prompt};
I'm hopeless, aren't I? Running around with my head in the clouds...even though I don't have the power to help anyone...${prompt};
I completely understand why Saliyahf got tired of working with me...${prompt};
You...you...${prompt};
...Idiot!!!${wait-36: 4}${prompt};
Saliyahf!?${prompt};
Hmph, you always...;
Always!;
...Always! ...Talk so big for such a puny weakling!!!${prompt};
And look at you now! You've finally managed to get yourself injured, haven't you?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Why do you do it? Do you not even know your body's own limits? How come you always gotta leap on the enemy like some wannabe superhero?${prompt};
B-but...${prompt};
But what!?${prompt};
But...I love this town!${wait-36: 3}${prompt};
I love it! I love the people who live here, and think this town is beautiful!${prompt};
...!${prompt};
We decided together to help out those in need, so people would grow to love this town even more!${prompt};
You feel the same way, right, Saliyahf?${prompt};
I...${prompt};
Even if I have to work alone...${prompt};
Even if I am weak, and get humiliated and hurt... I'm going to do what I can to help!${prompt};
...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Hey... What are you holding there?${wait-36: 2};
Isn't that the package?${prompt};
You found it!;
Oh, thank you! I must deliver this immediately!${prompt};
...Wait.${prompt};
You can't stop me. I will get this package to its destination, may lightning strike me!${prompt};
I told you to wait!${prompt};
...Come with me.${prompt};
...Huh?${prompt};
If I don't help you out, you're going to get yourself hurt, and it's going to haunt me in my dreams. I've never met such a complete nuisance!${prompt};
You'll...you'll really help me out?${prompt};
I said I would, didn't I? Stop fiddling around and get over here!${prompt};
Y-yes, sir!${prompt};
Thanks so much for your help, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].${prompt};
Come see me later, and I'll give you a token of my appreciation.${prompt};
Bye!${prompt};Au revoir!${prompt}
Saliyahf? Did you get hurt? What's that bruise from?${prompt};
Leave me alone. It's nothing.;
Hurry up now, before the beastmen attack again!${prompt};
Ah, you again.${prompt};
I couldn't do anything for you during all the commotion earlier, so please take this now.${prompt};
This is just between me and you, but I also went to the Commoner's Ward to search for the package. You got to it before I did, though.${prompt};
It was nothing, though, so don't patronize me. I'm no weakling, got it?${prompt};
I'm at my strongest in a pinch, though... That's why working with Wazyih is good for me.${prompt};
Well, whatever. Anyway, keep up the good work.${prompt};
Oh, thank you so much for earlier!${prompt};
I told you I would thank you, didn't I? Saliyahf has something I want to give to you, so talk to him, okay?${prompt};
Hey, how's it going? Like it here in Aht Urhgan? Not like you could admit it if you don't... You know I'd feed ya to the fishes if you said anything bad about this town, right?${prompt};
Oh, hey! How are things? Same as always, here!;
I've got to work hard and make sure the mercenaries get a good impression of this town!${prompt};

Basic rules.;
Official/private matches.;
Flammen-Brenner.;
Flamme.;
Match score.;
Petras and quarrying.;
Sprint.;
KO.;
Return.${prompt};
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};
What do you wish to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Basic rules.;
About area-specific rules.;
About returning to battle.;
About special rules.;
Nothing at the moment.${prompt};
Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt};
The rules are simple.;
Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt};
Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt};
These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt};
Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt};
${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt};
Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt};
(1) Successfully throw them into a rook.;
(2) Leave the area.;
(3) Are knocked out.${prompt};
But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt};
As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt};
All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt};
However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt};
The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt};
Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt};
Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt};
So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt};
There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt};
To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook's${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt};
Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt};
This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt};
Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt};
The following match types are area-specific:;
All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest;
All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands;
Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt};
Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt};
Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt};
Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt};
When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt};
For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt};
After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt};
If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt};
Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.;
Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt};

Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt};
Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt};
If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt};
Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt};
Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt};
Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt};
While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt};
Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt};
However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.;
Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player's ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt};
All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt};
Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt};
During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt};
In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:;
Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt};
Level 40 matches: 31～40;
Level 50 matches: 41～50;
Level 60 matches: 51～60;
Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt};
Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt};
When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt};
Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Basic Information.;
Registering Points.;
Rewards.;
Chevron & Title List.;
None.${prompt};
Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.${prompt};
Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.${prompt};
After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.${prompt};
If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special ${color: 5}chevron${color: 1} as well as a new ${color: 5}title${color: 1}.${prompt};
There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.${prompt};
Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.${prompt};
Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.${prompt};
However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.${prompt};
Finally, ${color: 5}checking${color: 1} someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.${prompt};

Ohohohoho!${prompt};
The ambassador plenipotentiary has just arrived from Windurst.${prompt};
Are you sure it was a Windurstian ambassador...?${prompt};
Yes, I saw her with my own eyes.${prompt};
The letter I received from Sir Raillefal mentioned no current tension in the Middle Lands...${prompt};
Do you think it possible that Windurst seeks to form a separate alliance with Aht Urhgan?${prompt};
I would not be concerned, Gessho.${prompt};
While the nations of Altana are not on the friendliest of terms, the bonds forged during the Crystal War are not so easily broken.${prompt};
Do not underestimate the fickle hearts of mortals. Especially those who are your economic rivals.${prompt};
And twenty years is a long time.${prompt};
This is merely my personal analysis...${prompt};
Despite being separated by an ocean, Windurst is the closest nation to the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt};
It is the nation most concerned with the intentions of her Near Eastern neighbors.${prompt};
I believe the decision to allow the passage of mercenary ferries was to have trusted adventurers shed some light on the many mysteries of this foreign land.${prompt};
If my theory is correct, we can assume that the ambassador is also here to test the waters, so to speak.${prompt};
Hmm, your explanation holds merit.${prompt};
Not that I would have expected less from the right hand of the golden knight.${prompt};
Gessho, please...${prompt};
My apologies.;
I will accept your interpretation of the situation.${prompt};
In any case, you may expect another communication from Sir Raillefal on this matter very soon.${prompt};
Glad I am to hear that. I eagerly await word from our mutual friend.${prompt};
My lord is of the same mind.${prompt};
In an effort to emulate your elegant Eastern characters, Sir Raillefal has begun penning his correspondence in a “unique” style.${prompt};
I am most flattered.${prompt};
Unfortunately, the monarlais is having a harder time than usual when deciphering official documents...${prompt};
I do admire Sir Raillefal.${prompt};
?${prompt};
He truly is an outstanding soldier among a nation famed for its military might.${prompt};
If you would deceive your enemies, you must begin with your allies, yes? By creating this code-like style of writing, he has constructed a perfect foil to potential conspiracies.${prompt};
Ah, I do not think that is the reason--${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You have chosen a fine moment to arrive.${prompt};
Sir Travialce and I were just discussing the shifting winds of world politics over a pleasant cup of tea.${prompt};
Won't you join us?${prompt};
How does your work progress?${prompt};
Another matter has occupied me so fully that I have not set foot in Salaheem's Sentinels for quite some time.${prompt};
You must relate to me all the recent happenings.${prompt};
How does our president fare...?${prompt};
What will you speak about?;
${selection-lines};
The audience with the Empress.;
The A.A.R.I..;
The truth behind contracts.${prompt};
I have no words to express my feelings.${prompt};
To think that the crown President Naja wore during the morning briefing was your reward...${prompt};
I myself have recently had insurance fees deducted from my pay...${prompt};
I secretly wondered if perhaps these funds did not go towards our president's personal expenditures.${prompt};
I am ashamed at my own lack of certainty.${prompt};
However, she does know how to multiply her profits...${prompt};
Should we merely accept these deductions as a part of a mercenary company concerned with providing a secure future for aging employees?${prompt};
What a piteous tale...${prompt};
It is said a great pile of gold pieces overflowing from the company coffers was exchanged for a hundred chunks of platinum.${prompt};
And this pile of gold pieces was your confiscated reward...?${prompt};
I must admit that when I first heard the tale, I thought perhaps the president was preparing to hand out our “bonuses.”${prompt};
Thinking clearly, however, it would make no sense to exchange them for platinum chunks...${prompt};
This is an outrage!${prompt};
The sample contract President Naja presented me with...${prompt};
That was not your true signature...?${prompt};
I am afraid to say that I was duped just as you were...${prompt};
How can I face Sir Raillefal after he warned me against Salaheem's Sentinels?${prompt};
Lift your head, Gessho.${prompt};
My lord was also tricked into signing a contract.;
You were both deceived by a cunning operator...${prompt};
That is true.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}, we all share the same fate as our colleagues.${prompt};
We must support each other through the times ahead.${prompt};
Continue telling stories?;
${selection-lines};
Of course.;
I'm done.${prompt};
Enough! I cannot hear any more of these frightful tales!${prompt};
The hardships I have endured cannot compare to the trials you have faced at the hands of that Mithra.${prompt};
You are the very soul of patience and perseverance.${prompt};
I, too, am inspired by your stoicism.;
I must not lament the hand I have been dealt, but stand up and carry out my duty.${prompt};
And so, I beg your leave.${prompt};
Sir Travialce, may we meet again.${prompt};
Now, I have some tales for your ears alone.${prompt};
These past days I have wandered far from the city into beastman territory...${prompt};
I undertook no mission, but merely wished to see the lay of the land.${prompt};
I trust you will keep this indiscretion secret from President Naja.${prompt};
Now, which beastman territory would you like to hear about?${prompt};
Which tale will you hear?;
${selection-lines};
Mamook.;
Halvung.;
Arrapago Reef.${prompt};
It was some days past...${prompt};
I was hiking through the Wajaom Woodlands when I had the misfortune to be captured by a scouting party and dragged off to Mamook.${prompt};
The city is built deep within a lush forest which reminded me of the red-leafed foliage of my homeland.${prompt};
I was held captive within a great jar prison for several days...${prompt};
Believing that my life would be forfeit when they at last found the mercenary badge upon my person, I began composing my final words...${prompt};
A trial was held, but when Sagelord Molaal Ja inspected my hands and feet...${prompt};
He granted me my freedom, saying the scales on my limbs made us beastman kin!;
He then went so far as to invite me into his home!${prompt};
When we began to speak more freely, I realized the Sagelord was as concerned for the fate of his homeland as I was for mine.${prompt};
Night faded into morning as we discussed a great many subjects...${prompt};
One of the more interesting topics concerned the Astral Candescence.${prompt};
Sagelord Molaal Ja believed the Empire's purported reasons for holding the candescence to be false, and that Aht Urhgan sought to use the treasure for military purposes.${prompt};
And when the Empire had mastered its use, he was convinced that nothing but catastrophe awaited the city of Mamook...${prompt};
In other words, the Mamool Ja seek to claim the candescence more to prevent the Empire from achieving its goals than to gain the blessings of power that the treasure provides.${prompt};
He was careful not to reveal the source of his information, but I felt the plight of his people most keenly.${prompt};
What could be the truth behind the nature of the Astral Candescence, and the Empire's designs?${prompt};
I wonder if remaining agents of the Empire is truly in our best interests...${prompt};
Unfortunately, I have yet to visit the city of the Trolls.${prompt};
It is most certainly on the list of places I would like to explore in the very near future.${prompt};
Do you know the reason why?${prompt};
It may surprise you.${prompt};
The ghost ship, be her name the Ashu Talif or the Black Coffin, has been seen frequenting the port of Halvung.${prompt};
What could possibly connect the ghost ship with the Trolls...?${prompt};
I will seek my answers at the source.${prompt};
Hm?;
Why am I so concerned with the position of the beastmen?${prompt};
This information greatly affects us as mercenaries of the Empire.${prompt};
Should a dawn come when the spirits of the ghost ship and the mighty Trolls join forces and assault Al Zahbi from both land and sea simultaneously...${prompt};
No matter how valiantly they fight, the Serpent Generals and mercenary forces will be hard pressed to hold the city...${prompt};
I have been to that place once since we boarded the ghost ship.${prompt};
More than the vessel herself, I am interested in the captain, Luzaf...${prompt};
However, I was unable to investigate either this time.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}.${prompt};
If those sailors have in fact returned from the grave after several hundred years...${prompt};
...then might there not be some terrible will at work here?${prompt};
Even without these undead corsairs and armies of shambling corpses...${prompt};
Even without the constant bloodshed on the eastern front...${prompt};
The borders of this nation are forever drenched in the stench of death.${prompt};
I wish to learn the truth.;
That is the only reason...${prompt};
I have exhausted my stock of tales for the moment.${prompt};
On my next journ--${prompt};
An attack!${prompt};
I could have sworn I saw a Yagudo here sipping tea without a care...${prompt};
A pity, I was hoping for the chance to cast Flare...${prompt};

Ah, my mistake, though the resemblance is near.${prompt};
An ambassador from our magical nation,;
would not know a soul among the Aht Urhgan mercenary population.${prompt};
Ohohoho!;
But this is just the thing!${prompt};
My local guide has a habit of disappearing...${prompt};
It really is quite tragic to be dependant on such a fool...${prompt};
But perhaps you might prove a more reliable tool?${prompt};

If I have to...;
Not on your life!${prompt};
You'll do fine, I'm sure!;
"No time for slacking; let us begin the tour!${prompt}";
Then I'd be happy to begin proceedings for an inquiry commission...${prompt};
And have you branded a traitor of foul ambition.${prompt};
I'm quite the expert in international laws.;
Of course, the choice to refuse me is entirely yours.${prompt};
You are familiar with the lay of the land, I presume?;
I wish to see the ruins known by the name of Olduum.${prompt};
Olduum...${prompt};
There are few in Windurst who would recognize the name.${prompt};
It's the philosopher Ramuh who has stolen all the fame.${prompt};
His legendary staff bears the moniker “Olduum,” you see.;
Ramuh used it to manipulate lightning and electricity.${prompt};
Legend has it that he created tools and carts that moved on this power alone.;
Though I wonder how many of these tales were set in stone.${prompt};
There is some truth to the stories, I feel.;
And I mean to get to the bottom of this deal.${prompt};
There are rumors of such tools being dug up in the Aydeewa Subterrane.${prompt};
Could this technology be used to drive a Cardian's brain...?${prompt};
Aphmau!${prompt};
Is this the Shararat Teahouse?${prompt};
Oh, Ovjang.;
Don't you remember coming here with the Grand Vizier?${prompt};
I did...?${prompt};
What is that wonderful aroma...?${prompt};
He wouldn't let me try any of the food for fear of upsetting my delicate stomach...${prompt};
And then you got in trouble for stuffing an entire helvasi into your mouth.${prompt};
Was that...?${prompt};
It couldn't be...${prompt};
Ohohoho. Such a rich scent.;
I think my weariness finally got up and went.${prompt};
I hAD★tHEm GriND★tHE hiGHesT★quaLiTY bEAns★fOr yOU, LaDy★KaRabAbA.${prompt};
As well you should.;
This sutlac pudding is also quite good...${prompt};
So soft and sweet, just like when I was young.;
This wonderful dessert just melts on the tongue...${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!${prompt};
I could never mistake that laugh...${prompt};
Seeing her in the flesh brings my oil back to a boil...${prompt};
And to have her enjoying those wonderful sweets right before my eyes...${prompt};
To taste the things that I was never allowed to...${prompt};
That's it!;
She's going on my enemy-for-life list!${prompt};
You'll get no disagreement from me.${prompt};
Hm?;
Isn't that...?${prompt};
Aphmau!;
Look over there!${prompt};
...?${prompt};

The Salaheem's Sentinels mercenary!${prompt};
What was the name?;
${name-player}?${prompt};
Yes, I remember ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] well.${prompt};
A Windurstian ambassador and a mercenary...;
What could it mean?${prompt};
Hmph...${prompt};
What could she possibly have to say to a mercenary?${prompt};
I can't hear a thing from here!${prompt};
I'm glad we were able to see ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] again!${prompt};
Hmph!${prompt};
Listen to me, Ovjang!;
I'm going to try and move a little closer.${prompt};
Are you sure you can do it without being noticed?${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Why do you think we stopped by the Immortals' supply room?${prompt};
Don't worry!;
I know exactly what I'm doing.${prompt};
${color-alt: 141}Aphmau uses ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
Oho. Very clever.${prompt};
${color-alt: 141}Ovjang uses ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!;
Let's go!${prompt};
Roger!${prompt};
So you see, by my calculations, a weak current passed through the central nervous system should improve a Cardian's reflex speed...${prompt};
By up to 3 times, or maybe more, should we have the need.${prompt};
That is why I need to analyze the insulation used in Olduum artifacts.;
I do hate to work in nothing but abstracts.${prompt};
(Hmmm... So she's interested in the Olduum civilization...)${prompt};
The reason these puppets are so easy to maintain,;
has much to do with those ruins and the secrets they contain...${prompt};
(Oh...whoa...!)${prompt};
(Aphm-mau...)${prompt};
(What is it?)${prompt};
(I c-can't...hold on for much l-longer...)${prompt};
(It's okay. We can leave soon.)${prompt};
(We can go? What did you find out?)${prompt};
(It looks like the ambassador and ${name-player} are going to travel to the ruins...)${prompt};
(I wonder which part...?)${prompt};
(I-Im going to...!)${prompt};
Did you understand my explanation?;
Because now Aydeewa Subterrane is our next destination.${prompt};
Of course, there is no such option as “no.”;
Gather your things and be ready to go.${prompt};
(Maybe I'll follow them to the ruins...)${prompt};
It should be a short trip.${prompt};
But until I find the best example of Olduum insulation, you'll be getting no tip!${prompt};
(Hmmm...)${prompt};
(So that's what she's looking for...)${prompt};
There are treasure-hunting beastmen lurking inside,;
so make sure you protect this fragile diplomat with your tough mercenary hide.${prompt};
!?${prompt};
(How dare she bully ${name-player} around like that...)${prompt};
(Unacceptable!)${prompt};

What!?${prompt};
(Will this office never get a moment of peace...?)${prompt};
Ah!${prompt};
That is to say...${prompt};
One of my mercenaries acted without my knowledge...${prompt};
And offered ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] services as a local guide?${prompt};
Do I understand you correctly!?${prompt};
(I'm not trained for this kind of thing...)${prompt};
My a-a-apologies!${prompt};
That blockheaded...;
Ah, I mean, that mercenary...${prompt};
...has smeared mud on the good name of Salaheem's Sentinels!${prompt};
Oh...oh dear...;
(I think that's the first time I've heard President Naja apologize...)${prompt};
It's unforgivable...${prompt};
...that one of my mercenaries was bested by a bunch of Qiqirn...${prompt};
And then prrroceeded to take a nap, abandoning a valued client in the depths of the Aydeewa Subterrane!${prompt};
Ouch...;
(I wouldn't want to be in ${name-player}'s shoes...)${prompt};
Oh.;
Hello, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You do have the worst timing for showing up to work.;
(Or is it always a bad time...?)${prompt};
The Windurstian Ambassador is here at the moment, talking business with President Naja...${prompt};
Did you hear everything...?;
The president is in a terribly bad mood!${prompt};
I think it would be wise for you to lay low for a few--${prompt};
Abquhbah!!!${prompt};
Yes, m-m-ma'am!!!${prompt};
Is someone there with you?${prompt};
No...I mean, yes...${prompt};
(I'm sorry, ${name-player}...)${prompt};
(I can't lie, President Naja can hear a Qiqirn sneeze from 100 malms away...)${prompt};
Hmph.${prompt};
Well, then.${prompt};
Ya need to take a look at the crrrystal compass.${prompt};
The ambassador would like to leave as soon as possible and needs a rrreliable mercenary.${prompt};
Just one thing.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am?${prompt};
Take ${name-player} off the list of candidates.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s rrruined ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] chance of showing our mercenary mettle to our forrreign guest.${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!!!${prompt};
Ohohoho.;
Such an aggressive, no-nonsense style.;
I haven't met your sort in quite a while.${prompt};
You flatter me, Lady Ambassador.${prompt};
Speed in rrresolving matters is part of our motto here.${prompt};

You...!?${prompt};
You?${prompt};
You...can put your trrrust in Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
There is some varrriation in ability, but all of our employees excel in the mercenary field.${prompt};
That good-for-nothing mudsucker you had the misfortune of meeting...${prompt};
...is the one bad apple in the barrel!${prompt};
Naturally, we shall prrrovide you with the most talented mercenary in our employment.${prompt};

HehE★heHEhE...;
VeRY★uNLikeLY, I★agREe.${prompt};
Ohohoho.;
Enough of that, King.;
Your pride is embarrassing.${prompt};
BuT, LaDy★KaRabAbA...${prompt};
We are making an official request...${prompt};
...I'm sure we need not worry about being lumped with someone like that former pest.${prompt};
Exactly, exactly!;
Only the best for our most valued clients!${prompt};
We should be able to view a list verrry soon...${prompt};
What could be keeping him...?${prompt};
All of our employees are so exemplary, it's sometimes hard to make a decision, you see...${prompt};
The ambassador is waiting.${prompt};
M-my apologies!${prompt};
Ah, here we go!;
So sorry for the delay.${prompt};
Now, which magnificent myrmidons do you have for us...?${prompt};
I'm terribly sorry, President Naja!${prompt};
Now what!?${prompt};
I...;
You see...${prompt};
This is the best we've got?${prompt};
I don't know that I want to have everythin' rrrestin' on this one's shoulders.${prompt};
He is a harrrd worker, I guess...${prompt};
And I'm sure he wouldn't want to let you down, President Naja.${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
Well, he's managed to get this far on gumption alone.;
Ya gotta give him that much.${prompt};
Lady Ambassador...${prompt};
We finally brrring you...${prompt};
Dum-da-da-dum-da-da-da-dum.♪${prompt};
An outstanding warrior from the rrranks of the Sentinels...${prompt};
Da-dum.♪${prompt};
Falzum the Fearless!${prompt};
Uh...h-hello.;
I'm F-Fal--${prompt};
He looks a little strrringy, but let me tell you, he's a rrraging tiger on the battlefield.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Why, in the most rrrecent attack on the city, he was beating down Mamool Ja on the right, and cleaving through Trolls on the left...${prompt};
...Very well.${prompt};
I rrrealize it's hard to believe, but once he gets going...huh?${prompt};
Very well.;
He seems sturdy enough, as far as I can tell.${prompt};
He needs only to have no fear for his life.${prompt};
You have nothing to worry--${prompt};
I require a guide to the Navukgo Execution Chamber--there is no time for splitting hairs with a knife!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Ex-Ex-Execution Chamber!?${prompt};
Ovjang...?${prompt};
Ooovjaaang!${prompt};
She's not here...${prompt};
Where...${prompt};
Where could she have gone?${prompt};
I can't find her anywhere...${prompt};
Grand Vizier...;
Where is my Ovjang!?${prompt};
It is merely one puppet among many.${prompt};
Do you need to make such a fuss?${prompt};
But...${prompt};
You are almost sixteen.;
Isn't it about time you stopped playing with dolls?${prompt};
What...what have you done with Ovjang?${prompt};
I have done nothing.;
Your toy was not in that place.${prompt};
You still have Mnejing here, don't you?${prompt};
And that other puppet...${prompt};
But no, it is not the time...${prompt};
Grand Vizier Razfahd.;
I have an urgent report.${prompt};
Speak.${prompt};
There is news on the investigation...${prompt};
Very well.${prompt};
Aphmau, you may leave.${prompt};
Grand Vizier!?;
I am not done speaking with you!${prompt};
I don't have time for your childish antics right now.${prompt};
Childish...!?${prompt};
Me...!?${prompt};
Enough.;
Do as you are told.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I despise you!!!${prompt};
You've let us down.;
Is everything alright, sir?${prompt};
She is much like her mother in her stubbornness...;
A firm hand will do her good.${prompt};
As you say, sir.;
The Immortals will keep a closer eye on her, should she don those clothes again.${prompt};
See that you do...${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
My report concerns the investigation conducted after the mercenary's audience with the Empress.${prompt};
There are rumors circulating in Nashmau that mention the Ashu Talif and the pirate, Luzaf.${prompt};
Rumors? Started by the Qiqirn?${prompt};
Yes, sir.;
There is a degree of unreliability...${prompt};
It is said that the ghost ship has been seen docking in the Troll city of Halvung.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
What can it mean?;
What connection could the Trolls have with the wandering spirits of corsairs...?${prompt};
I regret to report that we have no concrete evidence as of this time...${prompt};
However, there is one more thing.${prompt};
Amnaf.${prompt};
Sir...;
I bring news from the staging point in Halvung.${prompt};
Waudeen, the Immortal on duty, has made a report...${prompt};
There has been a sighting of Cerberus in Halvung.${prompt};
Cerberus?${prompt};
The three-headed hound that guards the gates of the underworld?;
That Cerberus?${prompt};
Yes, Grand Vizier.;
He is also known to have the role of hunter...${prompt};
...to chase down souls that flee the realm of the dead...rend them with his terrible jaws, and return them to the underworld...${prompt};
There has been an endless stream of accounts from mercenaries dispatched to the area.${prompt};
At the very least, we can confirm that some creature resembling the legendary Cerberus is indeed in the vicinity.${prompt};
The guard dog of Hades, ghost ships, the Dark Rider...${prompt};
Heh.${prompt};
I almost wish to raise a toast in celebration.${prompt};
The cursed dead are gathering to hinder our grand plan.${prompt};
Which only proves our cause to be just, would you not agree?${prompt};
Wholeheartedly, sir.${prompt};
Do not relax your surveillance.;
Remember your assignments: the Halvung Moblins, Luzaf and his decrepit warship, that pseudo-ambassador from Windurst, our favorite mercenary, and most of all...${prompt};
...the Empress.${prompt};
I-I'm sorry!${prompt};
I just...I can't...${prompt};
The Ex-Ex-Execution Chamber...!${prompt};
It's beyond the base of the Halvung T-T-Troll Mercenaries...${prompt};
Past the crevasses b-b-boiling with m-m-magma...;
Where the h-h-helldog Cerberus is said to stalk the tunnels...${prompt};
I just heard so...from Cacaroon, the rumormonger...${prompt};
E-e-even if I had a hundred lives...${prompt};
...I could never make it to that awful p-p-place!${prompt};
Enough of your yammerin'!${prompt};
I-I-I...!${prompt};
Do ya mean to sling mud on our good name as well!?${prompt};
I-I-I don't want anything to do with m-m-mud! Or m-m-magma!${prompt};
What are ya blabberin' about!?${prompt};
If ya want to see volcanic errruptions, ya just keep tryin' my patience!${prompt};
P-p-please! D-d-don't make me go!${prompt};
Unbelievable...${prompt};
I'm givin' ya this huge chance to prrrove yourself.${prompt};
And all ya do is cause me headaches!${prompt};
What a pitiful sight.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
YeS, piTifUL★iNdeED.${prompt};
Perhaps I should try another company, now that this has come to light.${prompt};
Wait! Please!${prompt};
A moment more of your time!!!${prompt};
(Can't let my guard down for a second...)${prompt};
Abquhbah!!!${prompt};
Brrring me another mercenary rrright away.;
I don't care who it is!${prompt};
Right...right now?${prompt};
Are ya tryin' to make me rrrepeat myself!?${prompt};
No, ma'am!${prompt};
Urgh...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Abquhbah stares at ${name-player}...;
(${name-player}! Would you go to the Navukgo Execution Chamber in Falzum's place?)${prompt};
Go to the Execution Chamber?;
${selection-lines};
A chance to redeem myself!;
I don't like the sound of that...${prompt};
We have ${name-player} here.${prompt};
Look, if it isn't ${name-player}!${prompt};
Aha...${prompt};
Oh. You again?${prompt};
I SHarE★yoUR diStAste, LaDy★KaRabAbA.${prompt};
Making these decisions is such a pain.${prompt};
I couLD★nEvEr mAkE★suCH a★chOiCE!${prompt};
${name-player}...;
You've got some nerve showin' your--${prompt};
I have decided to change my stance!;
I will give this mercenary one more chance.${prompt};
ArE yoU ★ceRTaiN oF★tHiS, LaDy★KaRabAbA?${prompt};
(${choice-player-gender}[He/She] will serve as my shield, should things go wrong.)${prompt};
(If ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can make it through to the destination, Qiqirn will hardly seem strong...)${prompt};
I will settle for so-so!;
Ohohohoho!${prompt};
Th-thank W-W-Walahra...${prompt};
NavuKGo★ExEcuTioN★ChaMbeR.;
Do NoT★diSapPOinT uS.${prompt};
If the client doesn't mind, then who am I to grrripe?${prompt};
Don't ya be tellin' me you're too afrrraid to go as well!${prompt};
Get your gear together, ${name-player}, and prrresent yourself at the Navukgo Execution Chamber!${prompt};
Ohohohohohoho!${prompt};
You've nothing left to prove!;
It's time for me to make my move.${prompt};
Thank you, Ambassador.${prompt};
I grrreatly appreciate your stance as a woman of action!${prompt};
I've never seen anyone enjoy chatting with President Naja quite so much before.;
(Why do I feel a chill down my spine...?)${prompt};
How absolutely wonderful.${prompt};
A branch office in the Middle Lands!${prompt};
And with the Star Sibyl's approval!${prompt};
Oh, don't give me all the credit.${prompt};
${name-player}'s performance in the Execution Chamber convinced me of your company's merit.${prompt};
And with mercenaries such as these wandering the street,;
our lackluster Mithra soldiers will learn to stop dragging their feet.${prompt};
(Though ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was nothing more than a wall,;
to prevent me from taking any damage at all...)${prompt};
Of course, of course!${prompt};
And you know, this mercenary is merely the tip of the iceberg for the talent we have here at Salaheem's Sentinels. Ohohohoho.${prompt};
What is your proposal?;
How will you run this venture with the resources at your disposal?${prompt};
Well, we'll have to start with choosing a location, designing the offices, hiring staff...${prompt};
Um, President...${prompt};
...ordering weapons, training the troops, negotiating with the Federation Army...${prompt};
President Naja!${prompt};
What!? Can't a girrrl plan in peace!?${prompt};
I...um...that's a lot of work...${prompt};
I wonder if Ibwam will be able to handle everything over there by himself...${prompt};
Hm...;
You're rrright...${prompt};
Hm...${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
Ohoho. You seem to have encountered a snag.${prompt};
I do hate when things like this start to drag.${prompt};
Abquhbah!!!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
How many people do you have working here?;
And tell me their registration numbers, would you, my dear?${prompt};
Um...that...that information is confidential, you see...${prompt};
Quickly, now!;
Surely you don't intend to make an ambassador scrape and bow?${prompt};
Oh dear...my poor heart...;
Please remember, this is top secret...${prompt};
<Whisper, whisper>...${prompt};
Oho! So many?${prompt};
(And what is the number of my shield, pray tell me?)${prompt};
Oh, that would be...;
<Whisper, whisper>...${prompt};
Such an easy number to recall...${prompt};
I have no more reason to stall...${prompt};
Using the employee registration numbers, I will attempt;
to divine who is “it” and who is exempt.${prompt};
!?${prompt};
A divination...?${prompt};
That's correct.;
It's an ancient Windurstian art with results that are near perfect...${prompt};
This song will choose the person you need,;
with amazing accuracy and surprising speed.${prompt};
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe...${prompt};
Catch a tiger by the toe...${prompt};
If he hollers, let him go...${prompt};
Cast the spell and...${prompt};
...you will know!${prompt};
And there it is!;
The registration number of who'll become your business whiz!${prompt};
A-and...who is it, Ambassador?${prompt};
Who is the lucky mercenary?${prompt};
Ohoho...${prompt};
(The suspense is killing me...)${prompt};
<Whisper, whisper, whisper>...${prompt};
Oh!?;
That number belongs to...${prompt};
...${name-player}!!!${prompt};
(I knew it...)${prompt};
I should've guessed...${prompt};
Oho. Are you sure this mercenary;
can handle such a huge responsibility?${prompt};
Hm? Oh, I'm sure ${choice-player-gender}[he'll/she'll] be fine...${prompt};
The mercenary you rrrefer to as your shield is our number-one ace...${prompt};
Even the Emprrress has granted ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] an audience...${prompt};
!?${prompt};
Is aN★EmPResS hiGHeR★rAnK tHaN★a kiNg?${prompt};
And yOU★saY tHiS★meRceNarY iS★aN “aCe”?${prompt};
ThiS★caNnOT bE!!!${prompt};
An audience with the Empress. How impressive.;
If you relate that story, you'll find me quite attentive...${prompt};
Ovjang...!${prompt};
Where has she gone...?${prompt};
What could she be doing...?${prompt};
Who do I turn to...?${prompt};
Who do I trust...?${prompt};
What do we do...?${prompt};
Ovjang...${prompt};
Tell me...${prompt};
Yes, once everyone heard the story, the applications have just been rrrolling in.${prompt};
(And President Naja made sure everyone heard the story...)${prompt};
And it's all thanks to ${name-player} here.${prompt};
So you see, sending ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] off to a foreign land would be like losing an arm.${prompt};
It would brrreak my heart to see ${name-player} go...${prompt};
But if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was willing to expand the company and build a new office in Windurst--${prompt};
Oho! I understand the point of your speech.${prompt};
Who would have guessed that the Empress was within ${name-player}'s reach?${prompt};
Huh?;
Well, yes.;
I, too, was rrrather impressed.${prompt};
${name-player}'s value in this land is beyond calculation.${prompt};
I...yes...huh?${prompt};
Ohohoho.;
I would never wish to damage your solid foundation.${prompt};
I must rethink this offer of an office in our land.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
Why, didn't you dismiss it yourself out of hand?${prompt};
Losing ${name-player} would be like the loss of a limb.;
I couldn't deprive you of that on a whim.${prompt};
No, no, I was just being--${prompt};
I HaVe★yoUR RefuSaL★sToRed iN mY★meMoRY BaNkS!${prompt};
Just a...;
Now hold on there...${prompt};
Such a shame. I envisioned your company protecting our nation...${prompt};
Salaheem's Sentinels would have been our salvation...${prompt};
But I would never dream of ruining your bond.;
That couldn't be fixed by just waving a wand.${prompt};
LaDy★KaRabAbA!;
YoUR coMpaSsioN★kNoWs nO★boUNdS!${prompt};
Ambassador...;
You don't mean to tell me our deal is off...?${prompt};
We must shift our planning back to square one.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Now we really must go. Our business is done!${prompt};
Just a damn minute!${prompt};
We have a banquet to attend--no time for further delay.${prompt};
The Grand Vizier is not a man I wish to dismay...${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
YeS!;

Ya must be thrrrilled.${prompt};
And I suppose you're expectin' the same sorta gushin' compliments from your prrresident, hm?${prompt};
Well, it ain't gonna happen!${prompt};

Get outta my office and outta my sight!${prompt};

Doctor Shan--;
Ah, Lady Karababa!!!${prompt};

I was just changing into my best clothes so I could take her to the Shararat Teahouse.${prompt};
You mean Doctor Shan--;

Oh my, oh my, oh my!;
I'll be cursed for sure!${prompt};

Ah, Lady Karababa means to enter the Navukgo Execution Chamber!?${prompt};
Hmmm.;
But at least I have been charged with finding an exemplary alchemist!${prompt};
Lady Karababa needs me after all!;
So much safer to be needed...${prompt};
I've been ordered by the King of Hearts to find an alchemist...${prompt};
The alchemist is to analyze the remains of an insulator they found in the Olduum ruins...${prompt};
But these Imperial alchemists are all so self-important and busy...${prompt};
An invitation to a banquet at the palace!${prompt};
Wow, even the Grand Vizier recognized Lady Karababa's importance.${prompt};
Oh! I should get my dinner suit ready!;
They'll probably be here for me at any moment!${prompt};
Sh-sh-she's g-g-gone!?;

I ain't gonna snitch on you to the boys in blue.${prompt};

I ain't no con artist.${prompt};
You got any interest in the Ruins of Alzadaal?${prompt};
You know, that place under the ocean wot's been protected as a piece o' cultural 'eritage.;
You must o' 'eard about it by now.${prompt};
Now, wot I'm offerin' you is a chance to enter the “remnants.”${prompt};

Listen, ${choice: 0}[luv/mate], that particular part of the ruins ain't the 'ole kit and kaboodle, if you know wot I mean.${prompt};
That's jus' the front door.${prompt};
The towers stickin' out o' the ocean round abouts are remnants o' the original Alzadaal complex.${prompt};
You've seen 'em on the Silver Sea ferry route, 'aven't you?${prompt};
Now, there are four o' these towers that 'ave been identified by the Empire: the Arrapago Remnants, the Silver Sea Remnants, the Zhayolm Remnants, and the Bhaflau Remnants.${prompt};
Accordin' to my sources, those remnants are fit to burstin' with tasty treasure.${prompt};
Don't you worry 'bout 'ow I get me information--that's me little secret.${prompt};
All you got to fink about is 'ow I can get you in there.${prompt};
And 'ow you're gonna carry out all that shiny loot!${prompt};

Don't strain your noggin tryin' to figure out 'ow to stop it.;

You've got the idea, so I'll make it quick.;
You've got Assault Points. I want 'em.${prompt};

Those ruins 'ave got a 'old on you, don't they?${prompt};
I'll cut out the chitchat and get straight down to brass tacks.${prompt};
Wot's this?;
You fink I 'ave time to explain stuff again...?${prompt};
Look, you've got a free ticket into the ruins as long as you 'ave the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
It'll vanish once you're in, but at least that tells you it's for real, right?${prompt};
I can't give you more than one at a time, or the boys in blue will get suspicious.;
So don't even ask.${prompt};
I'll always be 'ere with more permits as long as you 'ave the points to spend.;
Now, you better go grab that treasure before some other lucky sod makes off wif it.${prompt};
Looks like the permit you got was the last one I 'ad, so it might take me a bit o' time to scrounge up some more.;
The number of party members that can enter the same remnants area at the same time is restricted to 1-18 members.${prompt};
All party members must be in possession of a ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in order to enter the remnants, and meet the level 65 requirement.${prompt};
All party members must be in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in order to enter remnants with a “II” in their name, and meet the level 96 requirement.${prompt};
Well, if it isn't the 'ero of the remnants ${choice: 0}[herself/himself]!;
If I'm not mistaken you're out looking for ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, right?;
Hehehe, you sure don't mess around, eh?${prompt};
Hey, don't go getting all defensive about it.;
I make it my business to know these things.;
And that's not all I know.${prompt};
The info I've got is going to cost you. Hehehe.${prompt};
No, no, no.;
Forget about 'em assault points. Information this choice is going to demand a...different type o' currency.${prompt};
I wonder, 'ave you come to 'ear of ${color: 5}tokens${color: 1}, yet?${prompt};
No doubt you're savvy to the Nyzul Isle Investigation, 'at slightly peculiar of assaults.;
Well, these tokens can only be obtained in those most unchartered of ruins.${prompt};
I think I've made it painfully obvious by now that I can never 'ave enough assault points.;
But truth be told, I am always interested in getting as many o' those tokens as I can as well.${prompt};
Unfortunately, they aren't nearly as easy to come across as the assault points.;
In fact, it's rare 'at I ever come across any of 'em. Bit of a predicament, it is...${prompt};
Funny thing about humans... Their desires certainly know no bounds.;
But that's not what you're 'ere to talk about.${prompt};
The copy of ${item-singular: 1[2]}, right?${prompt};
If you're really after one, I suppose I could get me 'ands on it for you.;
It's just going to cost you a certain number o' tokens, of course.${prompt};
I've got confidence in you though, ${name-player}.;
You're probably already rolling in tokens as it is, am I right?${prompt};
Well, it's kind o' difficult to put a number on something like 'at. But for the sake of argument, let's say...${prompt};
${number: 2} tokens!${prompt};
Too pricey?${prompt};
Well, if you really want one I reckon you'll be willin' to come up with 'em somehow.;
Stop on by anytime. I'll keep up my end.${prompt};
There's my favorite remnants romper!;
After a copy of ${item-singular: 1[2]}, are you? Truth be told, I already had me 'ands on one before I ever 'eard you were looking.;
Sometimes I swear I'm blessed with the gift of foresight.${prompt};
I would 'ave said something to you sooner, but it just seemed a bit uncouth of me to be rubbing your nose in it by pointing it out.;
Hehehe.${prompt};
So, let's get down to brass tacks. You looking to trade your tokens for this 'ere copy of ${item-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt};
Make sure you know you're getting into 'ere, all right?;
No refunds from me, ya 'ear?${prompt};
Trade for the ${item-singular: 1[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, please.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
You're absolutely sure about this?;
${selection-lines};
Don't make me say it again.;
On second thought...${prompt};
Deal! That settles it then. 'Em there tokens for this 'ere copy of ${item-singular: 1[2]}.;
No turning back now!${prompt};
Hey, what's the big idea here?!?;
You don't even 'ave the number o' tokens we agreed upon. I 'ope you aren't expecting me to front you.;
No layaway plans here, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.;
Look at 'em bags, for Altana's sake. You couldn't fit a 'unk o' rock salt in there, let alone 'is.;
Go get your act together and come back. Then maybe we can deal.${prompt};
Current number of tokens: ${number: 2}.${prompt};
Something else I can 'elp you wif?${prompt};
Is there something else?;
${selection-lines};
Not really.;
Trading for ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Well, well, if it isn't ${name-player}.;
Keepin' your nose to the grrrindstone?${prompt};
Keepin' your nose to the grrrindstone?;
${selection-lines};
You betcha.;
I never liked the word “grind.”${prompt};

Good-for-nothin', blockheaded...${prompt};
But enough of that.;
Ya wanna hear somethin' strrrange?${prompt};
Rrrecently I've been floatin' on a cloud of calm.${prompt};
And I'm sure you're achin' to know why.${prompt};
Ya see, the company earrrnins have finally begun to live up to my expectations.${prompt};
And it's about time!${prompt};
Those days and nights of painfully buildin' up a rrreputation for my buddin' enterprrrise...${prompt};

I can sense that the universe...${prompt};
...is rrrewardin' me for my effort.${prompt};
Things are going to be okay frrrom now on!${prompt};
I'm certain of it!${prompt};
I'm even startin' to think about showin' some grrratitude towards my faithful employees.${prompt};
Lala～lalala.♪${prompt};
(${name-player}...)${prompt};
(${name-player}!)${prompt};
(Over here!)${prompt};
Ever since the Windurstian ambassador left, President Naja has been completely focused.${prompt};
Nothing but work, work, and more work!${prompt};
Her head has been filled with nothing but the sound of clinking coins!${prompt};
Her dedication to the running of this business has been even more pathological than usual...${prompt};
So now, seeing President Naja in this tranquil state is unsettling to say the least.${prompt};
She barely registers the existence of anyone around her when she gets like this.${prompt};
Oh?${prompt};
Was there something you wished to discuss with the president?${prompt};
For I, Abquhbah, am here to answer all your queries and doubts!${prompt};
I feel I owe you a favor, after all.${prompt};
Now, what's on your mind, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Whatever happened to...;
${selection-lines};
Gessho?;
Aphmau?;
Lady Karababa?${prompt};
Gessho?;
He hasn't shown his beak in here for a while.${prompt};
Some of the other mercenaries say they've seen him in Mamook...${prompt};
He must be keeping busy with missions, I suppose.${prompt};
Aphmau?${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...${prompt};
I wouldn't mention that name around President Naja!${prompt};
Last I heard, she had returned to the pala--${prompt};
Uh-oh...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...${prompt};
President Naja!;
President Naja!!;
President Naja!!!;
Wh-wh-what!?${prompt};
How many times do I gotta tell ya not to yell in my ear like that!${prompt};
I've neglected to bring a very important matter to your attention...;
My most humble apologies!${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Well, what do we have here?;
A gilded envelope stamped with the seal of the two-headed serpent...${prompt};
Signed in the hand of the Grand Vizier...${prompt};
Addressed to...${prompt};
...${name-player}!${prompt};
You've been singled out by the palace again...${prompt};
Do ya mind if I take a quick look at this?${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Oho...${prompt};
Did ya show up today because you had a feelin' this would be arrivin'?${prompt};
Had a feelin', did ya?;
${selection-lines};
That's right.;
I had no idea...${prompt};
I've had just about enough of your wisecrrrackin'.${prompt};
Well, ya coulda fooled me.${prompt};
This here letter is a personal summons from the Grand Vizier Razfahd himself!${prompt};
We've come up in the world now, haven't we, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] ${choice: 0}[entry-level employee/Private Second Class/Private First Class/Superior Private/Lance Corporal/Corporal/Sergeant/Sergeant Major/Chief Sergeant/Second Lieutenant/First Lieutenant/Captain]?${prompt};
From the looks of it, His Excellency requires your prrresence prrronto.${prompt};
Ya know what ya gotta do?${prompt};
Then why are ya still here!?${prompt};
Are ya trrryin' to bring the wrrrath of the entire palace down upon us!?${prompt};
Are ya trrryin' to cut into our new prrrofit margin!?${prompt};
Are ya...${prompt};
I've worked too hard to have this company's rrreputation rrruined by the likes of you!;
Now scat!${prompt};
I don't care what business you have in the Imperial Ward. No one bearing weapons will be allowed to pass.${prompt};
What's this?;
You say the Grand Vizier has sent for you?${prompt};
Very well.;
You are free to pass through the gate.${prompt};
The Imperial Ward lies on the other side of this wall.;
Watch your tongue in there, mercenary.${prompt};
Sellswords...${prompt};
We meet again, mercenary.${prompt};
${name-player}, wasn't it?${prompt};
We are once again in need of your impressive talents.${prompt};
According to the report we received from Salaheem's Sentinels...${prompt};
...it appears that ${name-player} is entrusted with duties not only within the boundaries of the Empire, but across every region of the Aradjiah Continent.${prompt};
Would you agree with this evaluation?${prompt};
Do you agree?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, the report is accurate.;
Actually, I don't get out much.${prompt};
Be that as it may...${prompt};
We have seen not the slightest response from the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you carry on your person.${prompt};
Hmph.;
It would not surprise me to hear President Naja had colored the facts.${prompt};
A pity, I had expected more from you...${prompt};
Ghatsad of the Aht Urhgan Archaeological Research Institute was most disappointed by the lack of astral candescence readings.${prompt};
However.${prompt};
We have no intention of abandoning our search for the candescences.${prompt};
The Empire--and the Empress--must know peace once more.${prompt};
Our citizens have suffered enough.${prompt};
As a mercenary on the front line of battle, you, as much as anyone, should understand the importance of our mission.${prompt};
Raubahn.;
The details of the mission, if you will.${prompt};
Sir.;
I trust you remember the court puppetmaster?${prompt};
Lady Aphmau has disappeared from the palace grounds.${prompt};
This was some days ago...${prompt};
From your expression I assume this is the first you've heard of the matter.${prompt};
Considering your recent involvement in events, we thought that perhaps you might...${prompt};
It appears we shall have to widen our search area.${prompt};
I leave this matter in your capable hands.;
The Serpent Generals require my presence.${prompt};
As you have probably guessed, the Grand Vizier wishes you to track down the whereabouts of Lady Aphmau.${prompt};
We believe she set out to search the winding tunnels of Aydeewa for her lost automaton, Ovjang.${prompt};
Mnejing, her other automaton, is missing along with his mistress.${prompt};
We have already sent Rishfee of the Immortals to recover our wayward puppetmaster, but I am dubious of his potential for success.${prompt};
If she learns that an Immortal is on her trail, she is likely to go into hiding.${prompt};
${name-player}.${prompt};
I give you these orders in the name of the Grand Vizier.${prompt};
You are to return to the Aydeewa Subterrane and assist Rishfee in his efforts to locate Lady Aphmau.${prompt};
I will communicate the details of the mission to your company.${prompt};
Do not fail us.${prompt};
Welcome to Walahra Temple.${prompt};
How may I aid you in your quest for knowledge?${prompt};
Hello, another soul thirsty for answers...${prompt};
This is turning out to be quite the day for visitors.${prompt};
Greetings!${prompt};
${name-player}!;
This is a coincidence.${prompt};
Lord Nadeey, please excuse me while I compare notes with my esteemed colleague.${prompt};
How do you fare?;
Nothing terrible has befallen you?${prompt};
No, no. You need not elaborate.${prompt};
I'm sure you are here to give your weary spirit a moment's respite from the madness of our occupation.${prompt};
Or perhaps...it is some duty that brings you to the temple?${prompt};
What, pray tell, lures you within this hall of serenity?${prompt};
Why have you come here?;
${selection-lines};
To pursue Walahran philosophy.;
To speak with someone.${prompt};
To speak with someone?;
One of the philosophers?${prompt};
The court puppetmaster?;
What dire circumstance would involve a mercenary in the pulling of strings and the dancing of automatons?${prompt};
The court puppetmaster...?${prompt};
Truly?;
A commendable endeavor, indeed.${prompt};
If you seek the wisdom of Walahra, then I would gladly set your feet upon the path.${prompt};
However, the set of your jaw tells me you already tread a harder road...${prompt};
Lord Nadeey.;
If there is something we should know...?${prompt};
Now they set mercenary hirelings on her trail...${prompt};
It appears the Grand Vizier has tired of this game of cat and mouse.${prompt};
It was only a matter of time...${prompt};
I suppose I shall have to “come clean,” as they say.${prompt};
And since you have some rudimentary understanding of Walahra's teachings, I will trust to your judgment.${prompt};
I have given the court puppetmaster--Lady Aphmau--shelter within the temple.${prompt};
You have given shelter to an Imperial fugitive!?${prompt};
That is correct.${prompt};
You have broken Imperial law!${prompt};
I cannot dispute this fact.${prompt};
Why would you do this thing?${prompt};
Some explanation is in order...${prompt};
You see, Aphmau was born a child in high standing--a resident of the palace.${prompt};
A member of the royal family...?${prompt};
However, her mother passed away when she was still but six years of age...and the responsibility for her upbringing came to rest with Walahra Temple.${prompt};
What an unfortunate story...${prompt};
Yet there must be more to the tale if none within the palace were willing to care for her.${prompt};
Yes.;Oui.
The details are not mine to divulge, however.${prompt};
Her childhood was spent within these walls, surrounded by monks and philosophers.${prompt};
How does such a child find the path of a puppetmaster?${prompt};
I was not aware of it at the time...${prompt};
But apparently, Lady Aphmau secretly learned the art from the street performers who practice on the Way of the Devout.${prompt};
Would not an expensive item such as an automaton have been difficult for a young girl to acquire?${prompt};
You are familiar with automatons, Gessho?${prompt};
I must admit to some curiosity...${prompt};
Then I shall speak more on the subject.${prompt};
Lady Aphmau arrived at the temple carrying two of the mechanical puppets.${prompt};
One she received from her mother...${prompt};
And the other from her older brother.${prompt};
Ahahaha...now I remember.${prompt};
At first the puppets were completely incapable of speech, and merely trotted around behind their little mistress.${prompt};
Before long, however, there was barely a moment when they weren't voicing their opinions on everything in sight!${prompt};
This change was accompanied by a return of Lady Aphmau's natural playfulness.${prompt};
I am glad to hear that...${prompt};
I know only too well the loneliness and uncertainty that come with being thrust into an unfamiliar environment at a young age...${prompt};
Indeed...;
However, there came a day when Aphmau's simple life was irrevocably changed.${prompt};
Yes, it was that day...${prompt};
Lady Aphmau.;
We have come on orders from the Grand Vizier.${prompt};
We regret to inform you that on the evening of the previous day, the Emperor's immortal soul passed out of the realm of Urhguum.${prompt};
I had not seen Lady Aphmau since that day.${prompt};
There are so many memories that flood back when I hear her name...${prompt};
She is currently within the Hall of Binding.${prompt};
You may speak with her if you wish.${prompt};
The hall adjoins our temple and can be reached through the door behind us.${prompt};
I shall remain here.;
There are some matters I wish to discuss with Lord Nadeey.${prompt};
The Astral Plinth...${prompt};
It looks exactly as I remember.${prompt};
I was studying day in, day out.;
The letters from my brother had stopped coming...${prompt};
It was more than I could bear...${prompt};
So you snuck into the Hall of Binding.${prompt};
Yes, with you...${prompt};
...and Ovjang.${prompt};
Just watching the candescence spinning around and around somehow made me feel better.${prompt};
It was like being wrapped in a warm blanket of peace and calm.${prompt};
Hehehe...${prompt};
That was the first time.${prompt};
The first time you talked to me.${prompt};
It was?${prompt};
Mnejing! You really are hopeless!${prompt};
That was when I realized I wasn't really alone.${prompt};
You and Ovjang were always by my side.${prompt};
And although I couldn't see them, my father and brother were here in the city.${prompt};
And my mother...I'm sure she's...${prompt};
She is watching over you, I am certain.${prompt};
Yes...${prompt};
I decided then and there that I would become a puppetmaster like my mother.${prompt};
You slipped out of the temple every night, and practiced with those performers...${prompt};
And then Ovjang began to speak as well.${prompt};
Ovjang really was the talkative one...${prompt};
Yes she was!;
But she was so talkative that I couldn't hear your voice anymore...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Well, that was then...${prompt};
You know, Mnejing, I have no idea what the Astral Candescence is meant to be used for.${prompt};
But if the other candescences are found and the colossus is completed just like the Grand Vizier says...${prompt};
There will come a day when everyone can be happy again.;
I'm sure of it.${prompt};
I mean, just looking at this orb was enough to turn my life around.${prompt};
Everything will turn out for the best.${prompt};
Don't you think, Mnejing?${prompt};
${name-player}!?;
What are you doing here?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player}'s badge flashes brightly.${prompt};
By order of the Grand Vizier?${prompt};
You can't be serious!?${prompt};
You're here to take me back?${prompt};
No! I won't go!${prompt};
There are still things I have to do!${prompt};
Go back to the palace and tell them that.${prompt};
Do you still take orders from us?${prompt};
Still taking orders?;
${selection-lines};
Sure...;
Not from you.${prompt};
Now that's our mercenary talking.${prompt};
You may leave us now.${prompt};
Not you, too...${prompt};
Well, I'm still not going back to the palace until I find Ovjang!${prompt};
And that's final.${prompt};
${prompt};
Lord Nadeey?${prompt};
The Immortal, Rishfee, is here to see you.${prompt};
The Grand Vizier is on to us...${prompt};
${prompt};
Lady Aphmau, I am glad to see you unharmed.${prompt};
Now it is time for you and Mnejing to accompany me back to the palace.${prompt};
The earlier you return, the less Lord Razfahd will be angry when he learns--${prompt};
...?;
You haven't made a report?${prompt};
No, Master Mnejing.;
I thought to first offer the option to Lady Aphmau...${prompt};
A commendable attitude.;
Then I shall be pleased to inform you...${prompt};
The Lady Aphmau will not be returning to the palace.${prompt};
!;
But, my lady...${prompt};
There are tasks left undone.${prompt};
Lady Aphmau.${prompt};
You still hope to find Ovjang...?${prompt};
If you knew that, why do you try to stop us?${prompt};
Rishfee?;
Your face is pale.${prompt};
I...it is nothing...${prompt};
You should return to the Imperial Ward and visit the infirmary.${prompt};
You are very kind, my lady.;
However--${prompt};
${prompt};
You'll just slow us down.${prompt};
And where exactly do you intend to carry out this search of yours?${prompt};
I...I...${prompt};
I'm not going to tell you!${prompt};
You won't...?;
<Sigh>...${prompt};
Please, my lady.;
It's not safe out there.${prompt};
The Immortals will do everything in their power to return Ovjang to your side.${prompt};
I don't believe you!${prompt};
You think I don't know?${prompt};
The Immortals are so busy watching the beastmen and searching for the Ashu Talif...${prompt};
There isn't a single soldier to spare for poor Ovjang!${prompt};
${prompt};
I only thought to--${prompt};
If I may?${prompt};
Who is this?${prompt};
I am Gessho, a colleague of ${name-player}'s in the employ of Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Hmm, another mercenary.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I may have some welcome news.${prompt};
Just recently I was in the vicinity of Mount Zhayolm on mercenary business...${prompt};
And at the foot of the volcano, I happened to see a red-colored puppet...${prompt};
!${prompt};
And then?${prompt};
This automaton was trotting along the path all alone, but being busy with my mission, I was unable to follow...${prompt};
It must have been Ovjang!${prompt};
One moment, Lady Aphmau.${prompt};
The Trolls of that region have stolen many automatons from the Empire.${prompt};
That is true...${prompt};
Ah yes, I had forgotten!${prompt};
You weren't done?${prompt};
There appeared to be something like moss or lichen stuck to the puppet's clothes!${prompt};
Moss?;
Could it have been moss from the Aydeewa Subterrane?${prompt};
I merely present the facts--how you interpret them is not for me to say. Only...${prompt};
Yes?${prompt};
Automatons taken to Halvung are thoroughly modified by Moblin craftsmen to follow the orders of the Trolls.${prompt};
After this process, they are barely recognizable...${prompt};
No!${prompt};
I would not waste any time if, as you suspect, this automaton was your companion.${prompt};
Y-yes, thank you...${prompt};
It is time I took my leave of you.${prompt};
Gessho, to what forsaken wilderness do your travels take you this time?${prompt};
My duties dictate a visit to the settlement of Mamook.${prompt};
A dangerous region.;
Do take care of yourself.${prompt};
Your concern is appreciated.;
Until next we meet.${prompt};
That settles it!;
We go to Mount Zhayolm!${prompt};
Lady Aphmau!;
If I may...${prompt};
Rishfee. Do you place so little faith in the court puppetmaster?${prompt};
Time is running out!${prompt};
I have just received confirmation.${prompt};
This Gessho character has no official orders that involve a visit to the capital of the Mamool Ja.${prompt};
He was lying?${prompt};
And that unmistakable presence...${prompt};
I felt the exact same aura just before I lost consciousness in Aydeewa.${prompt};
What are you trying to say?${prompt};
That story of his was nothing more than a ruse.${prompt};
In fact, it's more likely that we'll find Ovjang in the same place to which he now travels--Mamook.${prompt};
Then Mamook is our destination!${prompt};
Why don't you escort me as well, Rishfee?${prompt};
If you are so intent on running headlong into danger, I suppose I have no choice.${prompt};
...;
But what do you mean, “as well”?${prompt};
Isn't it obvious?${prompt};
I wouldn't brave the depths of Mamook without my faithful bodyguard, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Even if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is under the command of the Grand Vizier...${prompt};
May the wisdom of Walahra safely guide your steps...${prompt};
B-but...my mission results have been so ordinary...${prompt};
Oho!;
Are ya tellin' me ya haven't rrrecognized it inside you?${prompt};
R-recognized what inside me!?${prompt};
The clever cat hides his claws, is that it?;
Potential, my frrriend, potential.${prompt};
Potential...?${prompt};
Potential!${prompt};
I'd rrrather ya didn't blab the fact to the other employees, but I consider ya to be this company's number-one ace mercenary.${prompt};
A-ace!?${prompt};
That's rrright.;
Salaheem's Sentinels' shinin' star!${prompt};
Isn't that wonderful, Falzum!;
You're a star!${prompt};
I'm an a-ace...?;
A...s-star!?${prompt};
But I'm afraid of heights.;
Stars are so high in the sky...${prompt};
Damn strrraight!;
Falzum, you've gotta embrace that ambition!;
Aim beyond the clouds!${prompt};
Y-you're right!${prompt};
Falzum!;
Or should I say, Officer Cadet Falzum!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
I hope you're rrready to work!;
You'll be signin' papers, trrrackin' down textbooks--all sorts of fun stuff!${prompt};
Please consult with me about the textbooks you need.;
I'll be happy to deduct the price from your pay this month.${prompt};
D-deduct? F-from my pay?;
Uh...okay...;
I-I...;
I'm sorry!!!${prompt};
Hmm...;
Do ya think I pushed him a little too far, too fast?${prompt};
P-President Naja...;
What should we do about Falzum?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ah, never mind...${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...${prompt};
Ah! ${name-player}!;
What luck!${prompt};
Well, if it ain't our most talented Chief Sergeant.${prompt};
Abquhbah, what are ya waitin' for?${prompt};
I'm sorry?${prompt};
For the love of...;
Plan Sigma!${prompt};
Oh!${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}!${prompt};
You've been selected from over five thousand mercenary candidates as the “President's Choice” for the Salaheem Officer Academy!${prompt};
And it was a hard decision, let me tell ya.${prompt};
But your name was the one to make it through, Chief Sergeant ${name-player}.${prompt};
If we weren't so busy with company administrrration and management, why, we'd jump for the chance to attend this prrrestigious school. Ain't that rrright, Abquhbah?${prompt};
O-of course, President Naja!${prompt};
All the latest facilities. Sumptuous meals. Kind and experienced tutors.;
It's the sort of dream academy that produces the elite of the elite.${prompt};
So, ${name-player}.;
Can I assume you're rrrarin' to enroll in the Salaheem Officer Academy?${prompt};
Rrrarin' to enroll?;
${selection-lines};
Ready and willing.;
Officer Academy...?${prompt};
Not the slightest hesitation!;
That's my ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]!${prompt};
The cautious apprrroach, huh?;
Now that's the kind of attitude that'll keep ya alive on the battlefield.${prompt};
Abquhbah.;
Why don't ya give our newest officer cadet an overview of the academy?${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
As you may have guessed, the Salaheem Officer Academy is an affiliate of Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt};
Well, perhaps the word “academy” is a little misleading.;
It's more of a private training facility for producing mercenary commanders.${prompt};
Ordinarily, our company headhunters would be scouring the world for potential candidates...${prompt};
(Unfortunately, our budget didn't stretch to employing headhunters this term...)${prompt};
Abquhbah!${prompt};
Ahem! Yes!;
But this year we're selecting promising individuals from among our own ranks.${prompt};
Ya should consider yourself lucky.;
Usually the academy doesn't accept anyone who hasn't passed the grrruelin' entrance examination.${prompt};
But I've decided to take a gamble on your obvious potential, and waive the rrrequired tests.${prompt};
Isn't this wonderful, ${name-player}?;
You could be playing a major role in the future direction of this company!${prompt};
If ya continue on your current path, you'll be stuck in the non-commissioned rrranks forever.;
Now, that's nothin' to be ashamed about...${prompt};
But graduatin' from the Salaheem Officer Academy will open the doors to the world of high-rrrankin' privileges!${prompt};
Surely ya don't want to waste all that leadership potential?${prompt};
Of course ya don't!;
Let's get the enrrrollment process rollin'.;
Abquhbah! Bring the application forms!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!;
You're sure about this, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
Sure, I'm sure.;
I'm sure there're strings attached...${prompt};
Abquhbah!${prompt};
Can't ya see Chief Sergeant ${name-player} is achin' to break into a new rrrealm of possibilities?;
Don't prrrolong ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] agony!${prompt};
A thousand pardons!${prompt};
Hello, there?;
What's that down by your feet?${prompt};
Could that be ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}There's nothing on the floor!;
Oh sorry, my mistake...${prompt};
Abquhbah.;
Am I seein' things, or did ${name-player} just nod ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] assent?${prompt};
Why, yes, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] appeared to move ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] head up and down quite deliberately.${prompt};
Well, well.;Eh bien, eh bien.
I'm glad to see ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] so eager to begin the trrrainin'.;
I knew I'd made the rrright choice with ${name-player}.${prompt};
Rrright, then. Let the enrollment begin!${prompt};
Abquhbah! Where are those forms!?${prompt};
Coming right up!${prompt};
Actually, come on back, Abquhbah.${prompt};
${name-player} may be my rrrecommended candidate, but ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] not a scholarship student...${prompt};
Ah, that is a pity...${prompt};
In that case, ${name-player}...${prompt};
There are some fees involved...${prompt};
For starters, the enrollment fee comes to ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
And then there's the initial tuition fee.;
Lastly, there are some miscellaneous expenses: textbooks, meals, practical exams...;
And that comes to...?${prompt};
A total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Well, that sounds like a bargain to me.;
Are we rrrunnin' some sort of charity here?${prompt};
Now all ya gotta do is sign on the dotted line.;
Abquhbah, take care of the paperwork over by your desk.${prompt};
Oh, and we don't accept payment in installments!${prompt};
This is the Tiger.;
Piggy No. 08 has taken the bait.${prompt};
This is the Snake.;
Confirmed. That makes five.;
We're one away from our optimal target number...${prompt};
One more?;
It shouldn't be a prrroblem--I've got another candidate lined up.;
He's just gettin' over a small bout of denial.${prompt};
Hmph.;
I'll be sure to beat that out of him.${prompt};
I'm sure you'll have no prrroblems.;
But there's somethin' ya should know about the candidate we just signed up...${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] your superior in rank.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Are we done here?${prompt};
<Gulp>...${prompt};
I've done my part.;
The rrrest is up to you.${prompt};
Drill Sergeant Rongelouts.${prompt};
Your enrollment fee comes to a total of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt};
Once you've paid me the required amount, we can begin the enrollment process.;
Any time you're ready!${prompt};
You're all paid up.${prompt};
Now if you could just sign here...here...here...and here.;
Oh, and here.${prompt};
Congratulations, you are now enrolled in the Salaheem Officer Academy!${prompt};
I'll just go fetch the academy guide.${prompt};
Don't go anywhere...${prompt};
Sorry to keep you waiting!${prompt};
This is your officer cadet?${prompt};
Yes, this is ${name-player}.${prompt};
Hmph.;
You're really relaxin' the entry requirements this year...${prompt};
Well, I guess that's not my department.;
Let's get this one blindfolded already.${prompt};
The location of our academy is top secret.;
I hope you understand.${prompt};
Oh, and you'll need this.;
It outlines the basic procedures for undertaking the training exercises.;
Please keep it in a safe place.${prompt};
Abquhbah hands you ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!;
Now for the blindfold!${prompt};
Are we all snug and sightless?${prompt};
Then we're off!${prompt};
I deal in livin' cargo.♪;
I'll hoist you up, then off I go!♪;
With a heave and a yo ho ho!♪${prompt};
I deal in livin' cargo.♪;
The bigger you are, the louder I crow!♪;
With a heave and a yo ho ho!♪${prompt};
Is that you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
I knew it!;
Do you remember me? It's Falzum!${prompt};
So President Naja made you enroll here, too?${prompt};
Wow, I never thought we'd be classmates again.;
I feel a little relieved, to tell the truth.${prompt};
I'll have to do my best to keep up with you!${prompt};
For the love of Altana, would you please cease that mindless yapping?${prompt};
This is a school for the elite of the elite.;
Try to show some respect for the serious students.${prompt};
I-I didn't mean to...${prompt};
You are one of those “special” cases that was exempted from the entrance examinations, are you not?${prompt};
Well, yes, I--${prompt};
I am Neosaliat.;
You would do well to remember my name.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I assume you must be ${name-player}?${prompt};
You have some modicum of fame in these parts as a career mercenary.${prompt};
It must be quite a step up from your days as a vagabond adventurer, yes?${prompt};
Ahahahahaha!;
I can see this will be most amusing.;
Pay no attention to him.${prompt};
Neosaliat is the son of a San d'Orian baron, and graduated from the Royal University at the top of his class. He's rather taken with his own superiority.${prompt};
But I think the fact that you're considerably more well known here doesn't sit well with His Puffed-Uppiness.${prompt};
I mean, everyone in Al Zahbi has heard the name of ${name-player}.${prompt};
You, on the other hand, I don't think I've met...${prompt};
Hello!;Bonjour!
My name is Falzum!${prompt};
I'm Yasmeel.${prompt};
Tsahyan Self-Defense Force.;
I guess we'll be attending officer school together!${prompt};
A pleasure to meet you!${prompt};
There's still a little time before the principal's address, but we should probably move into position.${prompt};
If there's one thing I've learned in the army, it's a good habit to keep one step ahead of the game.${prompt};
You know, I think I'll just slip out.;
If the rrrumors I've heard are trrrue, this school--${prompt};
Don't be a scaredy-cat.;
Those rrrumors are probably exaggerated, anyway.${prompt};
I don't know...${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Think about it: we were chosen to become officers.;
That makes us the elite of the elite!${prompt};
We can handle anything they thrrrow at us.;
Even if that “anything” includes--${prompt};
Shhh!;
The principal's address is about to start...${prompt};
Testing, testing...${prompt};
W-wait, isn't that...?${prompt};
New officer cadets!;
Welcome to the Salaheem Officer Academy.${prompt};
I am Principal Koja Salaheem.${prompt};
I hope your stay at our prrrestigious school is...${prompt};
...an “enriching” experience.${prompt};
That is all!${prompt};
Th-thank you for those inspiring words, Principal Salaheem...${prompt};
I am Vice Principal Arcuhbah.${prompt};
I will be outlining basic training procedures.${prompt};
Hey, doesn't that vice principal rrremind you of someone?${prompt};
I was thinking the same thing.;
But then, I've seen a lot of people with that haircut...${prompt};
I guess you're rrright...${prompt};
Ahem!;
This term's curriculum will include the following courses:${prompt};
Infiltration.${prompt};
Platoon Combat.${prompt};
Survival Training.${prompt};
Completing these three courses will be your objective for the first term.${prompt};
However!;
Any cadet who drops from the academy without completing the term will be charged a penalty fee.;
You have been warned.${prompt};
In other words, we better all aim to finish the courses.${prompt};
Hmph. Naturally.${prompt};
For details on how to pay your tuition fees for the training courses, please refer to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Oh my!;
Look here, ${name-player}...${prompt};
There's some fine print at the back of the manual...${prompt};
Let's see...;
Where am I going to find that kind of money?${prompt};
And now you're in for a treat.;
Meet our head instructor, the famous and decorated war hero...${prompt};
Dri--;
Drill Sergeant Rongelouts!!!;
(No...my big announcement...!);
What a motley group of maggots.${prompt};
(Did...did he just call us maggots?)${prompt};
No talking, maggots!;
Form up! Two ranks!${prompt};
Move it! Move it! Move it!;
This is now a battlefield!${prompt};
(I knew it...)${prompt};
(This can't be happening...)${prompt};
Right!;
Listen up, maggots!${prompt};
I am Drill Sergeant Rongelouts!${prompt};
My word is law and your hides are mine.;
Right now you maggots are less than nothing.;
Your pretty ranks aren't worth the spit I'd use to polish my boots.${prompt};
I can and will squash you under my heel at any time!${prompt};
(Th-this terrible man is our “kind and experienced” tutor!?)${prompt};
Which of you slimy maggots just spoke without my permission!?${prompt};
<Gulp!>${prompt};
Was it you?;
Are you the chatty little maggot who disobeyed my orders?${prompt};
I-I'm s-sorry, s-sir!${prompt};
You want to open your mouth that badly, maggot!?${prompt};
Then why don't you keep it open.${prompt};
If you close your twitchy trap before I give you leave, I'll sew it shut with bloodthread!${prompt};
Don't let him hurt me, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Hm?;
${name-player}?${prompt};
Ah, so this is the famous ${name-player}...${prompt};
I'll be sure to provide special treatment for our “celebrity” and ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] twitchy friend.;
I hope you don't mind the sight of blood...${prompt};
(I think I'm going to faint...)${prompt};
Okay! Well, aren't you boys and girls lucky to be blessed with such an enthusiastic instrrructor!${prompt};
I look forward to seein' ya all at the grrraduation ceremony...hopefully still brrreathin'.${prompt};
This concludes our orientation.${prompt};
Shall we leave these new cadets in your care, Drill Sergeant?${prompt};
I'll whip them into shape, Vice Principal, don't you worry.${prompt};
Eyes front!${prompt};
Even maggots like you know how to read, right?${prompt};
I'm asking you a question, maggots!${prompt};
Yes, D-Drill Sergeant...${prompt};
I can't hear you!${prompt};
Yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Then you know how to pay your tuition fees.;
Get that squared away, and report for training!${prompt};
How are you finding the academy, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Check your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for details on how to sign up for the training courses.${prompt};
That manual will be your guide until the end of the first term.;
Please keep it on you at all times.${prompt};
A pittance, really.${prompt};
Ah, ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} for your training course.${prompt};
I'll just call the academy guide and you can be on your way.${prompt};
Oho, this one again, is it?;
Hope you've been layin' off the puddin'...${prompt};
Righto, here's your blindfold.${prompt};
I deal in livin' cargo.♪;
I'll hoist you up, then off I go!♪;
With a heave and a yo ho ho...${prompt};
Looks like the rrrumors were true.${prompt};
I thought that nightmare drrrill sergeant was just a story to scare new cadets...${prompt};
I've gotta get outta this place!${prompt};
And pay the “penalty fee”?;
I don't think your pockets are that deep, darrrlin'...${prompt};
Oh, I'm glad to see you and Falzum didn't decide to quit.${prompt};
Looks like our first training course will be Infiltration.;
Do you think you'll pass, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Think you'll pass?;
${selection-lines};
With flying colors!;
Pass out, probably...${prompt};
Hehe, you're confident.${prompt};
I think I see why Falzum likes to have you around--it's very reassuring!${prompt};
Hehe, I know what you mean...${prompt};
What's up with Falzum, anyway?${prompt};
(I'm terribly sorry, Drill Sergeant.;
Hmm... My abject apologies, Drill Sergeant.;
No, that's no good...)${prompt};
(There must be a better phrase...)${prompt};
So, shall we go over what we know before the training course begins?${prompt};
もちろん、さん付けはナシ。${prompt};
Hmph...I doubt anything you think you know will be helpful here.${prompt};
Of course, you are free to fail on your own merits.;
Ahahahaha!${prompt};
Good day, maggots!${prompt};
It's time for you to crawl!;
Form up!${prompt};
Today's training exercise is Infiltration!${prompt};
A single misstep by a commanding officer in enemy territory can place an entire unit in danger.${prompt};
Now, what do we need to train to prevent this kind of disaster?${prompt};
Perception!${prompt};
It is imperative that an officer have the ability to accurately assess any situation that the unit faces.${prompt};
To do that, you need to develop sharp eyes and keen judgment.;
Are you ready to train, maggots!?${prompt};
Since I'm sure your flea-sized brains were just overwhelmed, I'll have one of your fellow maggots give a demonstration.${prompt};
${name-player}!;
You've had some experience on the battlefield.;
Let's see what you've learned.${prompt};
Infiltration is the name of the game!${prompt};
Come on, maggot.;
Look lively!${prompt};
On the battlefield, a soldier that waits to hear the same order twice is a dead soldier.;
Listen up, because I'm only going to explain this once.${prompt};
You're going to be blindfolded.${prompt};
When I give the signal, remove the blindfold.${prompt};
In front of you, there'll be a certain scene.${prompt};
After a brief period, you'll be blindfolded again and I'll be interrogating you about the scene you just witnessed.${prompt};
All you need to do is answer. Simple, right?${prompt};
You are now in heavily populated enemy territory.;
Stay alert!${prompt};
Scene 1!${prompt};
3...;
2...;
1...;
Time.${prompt};
Situation report, ${name-player}!${prompt};
What did you see?${prompt};
What did you see?;
${selection-lines};
Tarutaru.;
Moogles.;
Chocobos.${prompt};
Correct...${prompt};
But how many chocobos were there?${prompt};
How many were there?;
${selection-lines};
5.;
6.;
7.${prompt};
Oho, give the maggot a medal!${prompt};
Don't get cocky.;
Any of you maggots should pass such a simple test.${prompt};
What are you looking at, maggot?;
Keep your eyes locked on the scene!${prompt};
Next!;
You are now smack in the middle of an enemy base.;
Focus all your senses on the situation before you!${prompt};
Scene 2!${prompt};
Situation report!${prompt};
How many chocobos were looking to the right?${prompt};
How many were looking right?;
${selection-lines};
2.;
3.;
4.${prompt};
How many chocobos were looking up?${prompt};
How many were looking up?;
${selection-lines};
2.;
3.;
4.${prompt};
How many chocobos were looking to the left?${prompt};
How many were looking left?;
${selection-lines};
2.;
3.;
4.${prompt};
Next!;
The enemy powder store is close.;
But don't let your mind wander--security is tight.${prompt};
Scene 3!${prompt};
Quickly!;
How many chocobo chicks did you see!?${prompt};
How many chicks were there?;
${selection-lines};
21.;
22.;
23.${prompt};
That's enough for today.;
You're still a maggot, but a maggot that might live long enough to become a fly.${prompt};
Your eyes are sharp--I'll give you that much.${prompt};
As you were, soldier.${prompt};
You slimy maggot!;
You call that a situation report!?${prompt};
How many of your troops did you just lose?;
I should crush you under my boot right now and be done with it!${prompt};
Bah, I'd never get the maggoty smell off me.${prompt};
I tell you what.;Je te dis quoi.
Because I'm such a generous and giving soul, I'm going to give you three chances to get this right.${prompt};
Burn that scene into your brain!${prompt};
Tell me, Chief Sergeant.;
How many times have you failed?${prompt};
How many times?;
${selection-lines};
Ah...once?;
Ummm...twice?;
Three times...${prompt};
There's a limit to even my generous nature.;
Now, get out of my sight, maggot!${prompt};
Is that right?;
Then why don't I give you the chance to...${prompt};
...get out of my sight, maggot!${prompt};
Next!${prompt};
Ummm...${prompt};
I saw six chocobo chicks...${prompt};
Are you trying to be funny, maggot!?${prompt};
<Gulp>!;
I-I'm sor...no, no...my abject apologies, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
I'll g-go get my head in order, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Running away again, hero?${prompt};
Hmph, I don't even have to order this one to do laps...${prompt};
Next!${prompt};
I saw one hundred and one chocobos pass by, Drill Sergeant.${prompt};
I'm impressed, maggot.;
What unit did you serve in?${prompt};
(I was in a...special operations...unit of the Tsahyan Self-Defense Force.)${prompt};
(I've heard the reason the island nation of Tsahya retains its independence is in part due to a ruthless assassination unit...)${prompt};
(I'd rather not discuss it, Drill Sergeant.)${prompt};
(Very well. We all have our secrets. But at some point I will want to hear the reason you left.)${prompt};
Next!${prompt};
I can't concentrrrate anymore...;
I...don't know.${prompt};
This is impossible!;
How can the rrrest of you do this!?${prompt};
Stop your squeaking, little mice!${prompt};
M-mice!?;
Has he taken a course in insulting Mithra!?${prompt};
Grrr!;
I'd rather be a maggot than a mouse!;
(Damn demon drrrill sergeant...)${prompt};
(D-don't make him angry...)${prompt};
Silence!;
What am I to do with these two blind mice!${prompt};
Supplementary training!;
And don't even think about scurrying away...${prompt};
(Oops, did he hear that?)${prompt};
(His ears are prrrobably sharper than his tongue...)${prompt};
All right, next!;
The baron's son!${prompt};
!${prompt};
Five females and seven males. One of the females will grow into a black chocobo.${prompt};
Hm!? It seems one of the male chocobos has a cold. Poor thing.${prompt};
Well, well.;Eh bien, eh bien.
San d'Oria wastes no expense in raising her noble sons.${prompt};
Your perception--not to mention knowledge of chocobos--is flawless.;
I'm tempted to give you full marks!${prompt};
Heh...${prompt};
But you must take care not to search for excess detail. It could lead to an error in judgment.${prompt};
You pass, baron's boy.;
Back into line.${prompt};
Silver Kettle!;
Take the chocobos back to the stables.;
Oh...and one of them has a cold. Take care of it.${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
Come along, little ones.${prompt};
Attention, maggots!${prompt};
This training exercise is over!${prompt};
Those maggots who failed need to report to me for supplementary training!${prompt};
Dismissed!${prompt};
Greetings, maggots.;
Today's training exercise will be Platoon Combat.;
We'll begin by...hm?${prompt};
I think we're missing a maggot!;
Where's the hero?${prompt};
I'm here, Drill Sergeant!;
<Gasp...gasp>...${prompt};
I-I dropped my t-tuition fee...on the way...to the company...${prompt};
<Gasp...gasp>...;
I t-tried to look for it...${prompt};
...${prompt};
...b-but couldn't...find it anywhere...${prompt};
...${prompt};
My a-abject apologies, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Listen up, my heroic maggot!;
You like to run, don't you?${prompt};
Run, Drill Sergeant?${prompt};
The army can always use a good runner.${prompt};
Your training today will be to jog around the perimeter of the academy until I tell you otherwise!;
And let me hear you sing, maggot!${prompt};
Mom and Pa, it's sad but true!♪;
Running's all I ever do!♪;
Leave my boots if I should die!♪;
'Cos I'll be runnin' up in the sky♪;
Salaheem's!;
Sentinels!;
Salaheem's!;
Sentinels!;
Don't stop!;
Keep running!;
One...two...three...four...♪;
One, two...three, four!♪;
As I was saying, today's training exercise will be Platoon Combat.${prompt};
Now, simulating a battle is not practical within the grounds of the academy.${prompt};
So I'll be sending you out to get some real combat experience.${prompt};
Meaning he does nothing while we go and find a battle to join...?${prompt};
(Keep it down! He can hear you!)${prompt};
Hmph. Finally learning, are we, maggots?;
Here's another thing you need to know:${prompt};
Your combat opponents will be beastmen!;
And your task is to bring in any one piece of beastman equipment!${prompt};
Hey, hero!;
We can't hear your inspiring singing!${prompt};
Y-yes...Drill Sergeant!;
Run my laps from morn till night!♪;
Maybe someday I'll learn to fight!♪;
Just pitiful...${prompt};
Poor Falzum...;
Isn't there anything we can do to help him?${prompt};
Don't waste your sympathy on the hero, maggots!;
He might be the lucky one here.${prompt};
You lot are off to face the beastmen.;
Once you have your piece of equipment, take it to Abquhbah in Salaheem's Sentinels for confirmation.${prompt};
After your task is complete, return here for debriefing.${prompt};
Don't dawdle, maggots!${prompt};
The hero is going to keep running until all of you are done!;
His survival depends on your actions!${prompt};
Find a beastman stronghold and get that equipment!;
Dismissed!${prompt};
Your task for this training exercise is to bring in any one piece of beastman equipment.${prompt};
Oh, and do please hurry.;
I'm not sure how much longer Falzum will last...${prompt};
Yes, this is exactly the kind of thing the drill sergeant was looking for.;
Excellent work, ${name-player}.;
Now, we better get you to the academy before Falzum expires!${prompt};
One moment!${prompt};
Express delivery?;
Get that blindfold on, then.${prompt};
Abquhbah...;
Express deliveries are extra...${prompt};
It says here you brought in ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Nothin' to it!${prompt};
You pass.;
Should've known the rodent would be good at collecting junk.${prompt};
R-r-ro...;
...${prompt};
I mean...thank you, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Okay, that's everyone...except Yasmeel.;
I guess the island girl didn't take the longer distances here into account.;
Hehehe.${prompt};
Apologies, Drill Sergeant!;
Here are my confirmation papers.${prompt};
Did you go to the Far East for your trophy?;
Let me see those!${prompt};
...;
Why are there two separate papers?${prompt};
Don't tell me you brought one for the hero's benefit?${prompt};
Yes, Drill Sergeant.${prompt};
You're walking a fine line, island girl...${prompt};
But part of this training exercise was to test your sense of teamwork.${prompt};
Anyone that leaves a wounded comrade on the battlefield is not even fit for maggot food.${prompt};
The hero passes as well!${prompt};
Hey, hero!;
Your fellow soldiers have saved your life.;
Stop running and fall into line!${prompt};
Mom and Pa...<gasp>...it's sad but...!?;
Y-yes...<pant>...Drill Sergeant!;
(How did this stringbean ever become a mercenary?)${prompt};
(He has been rrrunning this entire time. You gotta admit, he's got some stamina if nothing else...)${prompt};
(Falzum is a mercenary?)${prompt};
(That's rrright. We all are, besides you and the baron's boy.)${prompt};
...${prompt};
<Pant>...<gasp>...${prompt};
Welcome back, hero.;
You should thank your classmates for helping you pass.${prompt};
I-I passed?;
Woohoo!!! <Cough!>...<gasp>...${prompt};
Don't think you're off the hook that easily, though.;
We'll be doing some one-on-one combat training later on.${prompt};
<Gulp!>;
Like...like a private lesson?${prompt};
A private lesson?;
Do you think you're learning algebra here!?;
This will be an exercise in mortal combat!${prompt};
You should be grateful for the experience!${prompt};
Y-yes, Drill Sergeant...${prompt};
I can't hear you!;
Yes, Drill Sergeant!;
Right.;
Today's training exercise is concluded.${prompt};
But don't worry, we've saved the best for last.${prompt};
Get a good night's sleep, maggots.;
I'll be waiting.;
Dismissed.${prompt};
The worst has happened.;
Your unit has become separated from the main force in enemy territory.;
You've lost your compass and your map.${prompt};
You survey the area, but all you can see are clumps of trees that all look the same.;
You can't even begin to estimate your unit's current coordinates.${prompt};
To add insult to injury, you're leading the greenest, most incompetent group of soldiers this side of Halvung.;
Your linkpearl is conspicuously silent.${prompt};
What do you do?;Que fais-tu?
Answer me, Commander Hero!${prompt};
M-me, Drill Sergeant!?${prompt};
Are you answering a question with a question, maggot!?;
I'm the only one asking questions here!${prompt};
I-I...I yell out for help!${prompt};
Gyaaahhh!!!;
Whaaahhh!!!;
You just identified your unit's location to every enemy within a hundred yalms!${prompt};
You're surrounded by Mamool Ja troops who proceed to rip out your entrails, flay off your skin, and take your skulls for trophies.${prompt};
It's a rare treat on the dinner table for some lizardman family tonight!${prompt};
Ewww!${prompt};
What's the course of action that must be taken to avoid this outcome?${prompt};
Island girl!;
What would you do in this hopeless predicament?${prompt};
First, I'd reassure my troops, then calmly assess the situation.;
Then, I'd search my memory...${prompt};
I would try to retrace my steps to a familiar area, then attempt to track down and rejoin the main force.${prompt};
Excellent answer!;
Memory is key!${prompt};
In a desperate situation, a good memory can mean the difference between life or death.${prompt};
So we'll be concentrating on improving your retention skills during the Survival Training course!${prompt};
Listen up, maggots.;
Today we'll be continuing your training in survival techniques.${prompt};
In a desperate situation, a good memory can mean the difference between life or death.;
And don't you forget it!${prompt};
In this exercise, you will be assaulted with a barrage of questions relating to your past experiences.${prompt};
Your memories will be your weapon in this battle!${prompt};
Think this'll be easy!?;
I'm here to tell you your memory is not as sharp as you believe.${prompt};
Let's start with the celebrity.;
${name-player}!${prompt};
There are eight questions in all.;
Fire those answers back as fast as you can!${prompt};
Question One!${prompt};
基本中の基本！${prompt};
What is Article 2 of the mercenary assessment criteria!?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Run errands without complaint!;
Follow orders without question!;
Fulfill requests without fail!${prompt};
Keep those answers coming!${prompt};
Question Two!${prompt};
I'm sure you remember the “Dark Rider.”${prompt};
How did President Naja describe the rider's mount?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Bigger than a Troll.;
Bigger than a marid.;
Bigger than a Mamool Ja.${prompt};
Keep your mind focused!${prompt};
Question Three!${prompt};
This will test your knowledge of crystal compass manufacture!${prompt};
Quickly!;
What is the name of the place where mythralline liquid can be found?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Mythralline Pond.;
Mythralline Lake.;
Mythralline Wellspring.${prompt};
We're just getting started!${prompt};Nous ne faisons que commencer !${prompt}
Question Four!${prompt};
Think back to the Qiqirn perfumer that once visited Salaheem's Sentinels!${prompt};
What kind of company did she think Salaheem's Sentinels was?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
A detective agency.;
A law firm.;
A modeling agency.${prompt};
I will weed out any slimy maggot that fails to live up to this academy's standards!${prompt};
Question Five!${prompt};
Going back to the Qiqirn perfumer.${prompt};
What was the name of the fragrance she created?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Empyrean incense.;
Imperial incense.;
Imperceptible incense.${prompt};
Do you have maggots for brains, maggot?${prompt};
Question Six!${prompt};
Surely you have a place in your heart for the three subordinates you were in charge of training?${prompt};
What was the name of the one who always stood in the middle?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Warjal.;
Zaldur.;
Qarimul.${prompt};
If you get this answer wrong, you'll stay a maggot forever.${prompt};
Question Seven!${prompt};
This question concerns a recent event.;
If you can't answer this one, I'll grind you into a maggoty pulp!${prompt};
There was an incident involving President Naja's morning star.;
What is the name of the weapon-devouring affliction that sent Abquhbah running to you for help?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
Redrust.;
Blackrust.;
Bluerust.${prompt};
If you don't remember this, your next rank will be Chief Latrine Sergeant!${prompt};
Question Eight!${prompt};
Abquhbah first noticed the problem with the morning star completely by accident when he tripped and fell.${prompt};
Why did he fall over!?${prompt};
Answer:;
${selection-lines};
He tripped over his left foot.;
He tripped over his right foot.${prompt};
You really are a maggot!;
Don't you remember anything besides the tasty, bloated corpses you gorged your slimy face on!?${prompt};
This is the path you've taken on the way to becoming a chief sergeant.;
Do you mean to stand before your president and tell her you've forgotten it all?${prompt};
Go work on recalling those memories!;
I'm sure there's a bard or two that can sing your stories, ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Miss] Celebrity!${prompt};
Am I getting through to your maggoty brain?;
You are dismissed!${prompt};
Oho...;
It seems our celebrity maggot retains more than just the names of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fans.;
You pass. Back in line!${prompt};
Your turn, hero!${prompt};
Y-yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Can't you answer a single question?;
That's what happens when you come unprepared.${prompt};
Why did I allow you to participate in the previous training exercise when you hadn't even paid the tuition fee!?${prompt};
S-so I could learn to become an outstanding officer, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Outstanding!?;
Your training had more to do with outrunning!${prompt};
Yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Hmm...;
However, I must say I'm impressed with your ability to discover the location of this academy.${prompt};
Thank you, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Although I doubt you remember the way after I beat it out of you in our one-on-one training.${prompt};
Thank you, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
${name-player}, you and Falzum are Salaheem's Sentinels' mercenaries, right?${prompt};
Are you mercenaries?;
${selection-lines};
We are...;
We could be...${prompt};
So, it's true...${prompt};
Well, I can't blame anyone for keeping secrets...${prompt};
Let's do what we can to help Falzum out.${prompt};
He's a little shaky, but once he learns to control his nervousness, I think he has potential...${prompt};
I guess I'm no ace after all...${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Don't give up!;
Believe in yourself!${prompt};
Exactly.;
You never know what opportunities await you, Falzum!${prompt};
${name-player}...Yasmeel...${prompt};
(I consider ya to be this company's number-one ace mercenary...)${prompt};
President Naja...?${prompt};
I...I...${prompt};
Are we boring you, Mister Hero?${prompt};
...${prompt};
If you're tired of training, my boot heel is ready and waiting!${prompt};
...${prompt};
S...S...S...${prompt};
Sergeant!!!;
!!!${prompt};
I-I've had enough of your insults and threats!${prompt};
Hello, did you grow a backbone, hero?${prompt};
I'm not a hero...${prompt};
I'm...I'm...!${prompt};
I'm an ace!${prompt};
Wha-?;
Wahahahahaha!${prompt};
Are you trying to kill me with laughter!?;
Oh, this is rich!${prompt};
This training exercise will be your last chance.;
If you fail, it's expulsion for you.${prompt};
You'll be washing dishes in the mercenary mess hall for the next ten years to pay off your penalty fee.${prompt};
Are you prepared to accept this challenge!?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
I...I accept!${prompt};
Oh, Falzum.;
I hope you know what you're doing...${prompt};
Hmph, people are limited by the gifts with which they are born.;
You cannot escape the fate Altana has laid out for you.${prompt};
You never know unless you try!;
You should be supporting your classmate, baron's boy!${prompt};
Heh...;
You truly are naive, island girl.${prompt};
You show that demon drrrill sergeant who's boss, Falzum!;
(Yeah! Don't let him get the best of you...)${prompt};
<Pant>...<pant>...;
What's gotten into you, hero?${prompt};
Not to worry, I have your measure now.;
This next question will send you on a stroll down Washout Lane!${prompt};
You're as good as expelled!${prompt};
<Gasp>...<gasp>...;
Bring it on, demon drill sergeant...${prompt};
I'm an ace!;
There is no question I cannot answer!${prompt};
Impudent maggot!${prompt};
Question Eight!${prompt};
You were once asked by President Naja to help an alchemist with her work.${prompt};
I know this one...;
It's “mythralline water”!${prompt};
Bwahahahaha!;
Did you think I'd end this with such an easy question?${prompt};
At that time, you received something important from someone.;
What was it!?${prompt};
Something important...?${prompt};
That's right.;
If you can't answer this question, you lack the qualifications to command anyone!${prompt};
(Something important...)${prompt};
(I was asked to collect some mythralline water...)${prompt};
What's wrong, hero?;
Time's running out.;
Fifty...forty-nine...forty-eight...${prompt};
(That's it...I was given those test tubes for scooping up the water.)${prompt};
(No, wait...;
I only borrowed those, I didn't “receive” them...)${prompt};
Thirty-seven...thirty-six...thirty-five...${prompt};
(Knowledge! Yes, the alchemy knowledge I gained when I learned about the mythralline process...;
No, that can't be right...)${prompt};
Twenty-nine...twenty-eight...twenty-seven...${prompt};
(The reward? No, the reward wasn't that impressive...)${prompt};
Sixteen...fifteen...fourteen...${prompt};
(I relied so much on ${name-player} that I don't...)${prompt};
Eight...seven...six...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Three...two...one!${prompt};
Time's up!;
You lose, hero!;
Time for that stroll down Washout--;
Friendship...${prompt};
I received the gift of friendship from ${name-player}!!!${prompt};
...${prompt};
If ${name-player} hadn't helped me out back then, I would never be standing here today.${prompt};
If ${name-player} and the others weren't helping me now, I...I...${prompt};
I quit.${prompt};
Falzum!${prompt};
If I couldn't find that answer staring me straight in the face, then the drill sergeant is right.;
I don't deserve to be here.${prompt};
Well done, hero.${prompt};
!?${prompt};
You've finally found the courage to accept your shortcomings and stand on your own.${prompt};
Drill Sergeant...${prompt};
Now, back in line, maggot!${prompt};
D-does that mean I...${prompt};
But I warn you.;
If you address me without the proper respect in the second term, you'll be instantly expelled!${prompt};
Yes...${prompt};
Yes!!!;
${name-player}!;
I passed...;
Falzum!;
He passed out!${prompt};
Attention, maggots!${prompt};
Congratulations, maggots.;
You've completed the required courses for this term.;
The principal will be making an address shortly.${prompt};
Woohoo!${prompt};
We passed!${prompt};
Don't get cocky, little mice!;
I'll have your hides for a throw rug!${prompt};
Yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
Stand to attention, maggots!${prompt};
Y-yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
What...what happened...?${prompt};
Falzum!;
Are you okay!?${prompt};
Where's the sergeant?${prompt};
Did I fail after all...?${prompt};
Hey, you're awake.${prompt};
You were rrrather impressive, as a matter of fact.;
I think I judged you a bit too quickly.${prompt};
Huh?;
What did I do?${prompt};
Don't you rrremember?;
That confrrrontation will be legend for future cadets!${prompt};
Testing, testing...${prompt};
The speakers are ready, Principal Koja.${prompt};
Thank you, Silver Kettle.${prompt};
Commencing the Salaheem Officer Academy First Term Closing Ceremony.${prompt};
I'd like to begin by congrrratulatin' the fourth class of officer cadets on the successful completion of their first term.${prompt};
Congratulations, everyone!${prompt};
However, don't forget that the second term lies ahead.;
Keep that intensity level high.${prompt};
Please step forward when your name is called.;
If you would, Vice Principal.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!;
Neosaliat!${prompt};
Yasmeel!${prompt};
And...${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
Drill Sergeant Rongelouts has a special announcement to make concerning these three cadets.${prompt};
Listen up, maggots!;
I'm only going to say this once.${prompt};
During the training exercises, you showed the potential to become full officers.${prompt};
And so I've decided to give you the chance to receive extra-curricular training.${prompt};
You will be sent to the front line to gain hands-on experience as second lieutenants.${prompt};
Don't celebrate just yet, maggots.;
You have not been officially promoted.${prompt};
This is a test of your ability to carry out the duties of your rank.;
Call it a provisional promotion.${prompt};
If you fail to live up to the standards expected of a second lieutenant...${prompt};
...I will strip you of your rank, and have you immediately expelled.${prompt};
Remember your survival training!;
I'll be watching you!${prompt};
Now, you maggots that weren't called forward!${prompt};
Continue your daily regimen of training!;
Review the lessons you have learned!;
Eat three square meals a day!${prompt};
Falzum!${prompt};
Y-Yes, Drill Sergeant!${prompt};
That goes double for you!${prompt};
That is all.${prompt};
Thank you, Drill Sergeant Rongelouts.${prompt};
This concludes the Salaheem Officer Academy First Term Closing Ceremony.${prompt};
Eyes front!${prompt};
Your first term training is complete!${prompt};
Dismissed!${prompt};
${name-player}! Falzum!;
Congratulations!${prompt};
Well, I never expected to learn so much from a vagabond adventurer.${prompt};
See you next term, Provisional Second Lieutenant ${name-player}.${prompt};
Wow, second lieutenant...;
You're the real ace here, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Finally! We're free!${prompt};
It'll be nice to have a break from that demon drrrill sergeant...at least until next term.${prompt};
Our cadets performed well.;
Not one of them tried to flee from that terrifying instructor.;
(Although, I find President Naja far more frightening...)${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Not one of them drrropped out of a course...${prompt};
Hm?;
Isn't...isn't that a good thing, President...Principal Koja?;
I was so happy for them...${prompt};
...${prompt};
Abquhbah.${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
Why don't ya go count up the prrrofits we made this term from enrollment and tuition.${prompt};
If only just one of those cadets had paid the penalty fee, our margins this month would have been...<sigh>...${prompt};
${name-player}...${prompt};
I still haven't changed a bit...${prompt};
I remember you and Yasmeel encouraging me to do my best for that last training exercise, but after that...${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
I have a lot of work to do.${prompt};
Ah! I mustn't...${prompt};
I have to go!${prompt};
I'll do better, I promise!${prompt};
Hey there, celebrity.${prompt};
Did you know how famous you've become arrround here lately?${prompt};
You hear rrrumors about ${name-player}, the mighty mercenary, everywhere you go.${prompt};
I'll be happy to sprrread those rrrumors even further.;
You should thank me.${prompt};
Your name might end up rrreaching the most isolated backwater towns in the Empire.${prompt};
Maybe even to Tsahya?${prompt};
Maybe not that far!${prompt};
Good luck with that “extra-curricular” trrraining.${prompt};
Try not to mess it up, or this one will be sprrreading the wrong kind of rrrumors!${prompt};
Take care!${prompt};
That was a tough term, but I'm glad I came.;
It was worth that long journey across the ocean.${prompt};
Do you know why?${prompt};
To meet my fellow cadets.;
Especially...ahem.${prompt};
I look forward to seeing you next term, Second Lieutenant ${name-player}!${prompt};
How do you reply?;
${selection-lines};
You too, Second Lieutenant Yasmeel!;
Same here, island girl!${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Second Lieutenant!;
<Sigh>...;
(This could be the end of my career in mercenary management.)${prompt};
${name-player}, just the ${choice-player-gender}[man/lady] I needed to see.${prompt};
Sorry for the short notice, but I have a favor to ask...${prompt};
Would you mind heading to the weapon shop for me?${prompt};
I have this important task from President Naja that I just can't put down...${prompt};
All you have to do is ask for the “item” for Abquhbah, and the shopkeeper will understand.${prompt};
A thousand pardons...${prompt};
<Sigh>...${prompt};
All you have to do is ask for the “item” for Abquhbah, and the shopkeeper will understand.${prompt};
A thousand pardons...${prompt};
What can I do for you?;
The “item” for Abquhbah?${prompt};
Ah, that's right.;
The guy from yesterday...;
Right, right. I got you.${prompt};
It's just that...there's a small problem.${prompt};
Hm?;
What's this all about?;
Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to fill you in.${prompt};
This Abquhbah guy came to my shop yesterday.${prompt};
He was looking for something to take the rust off a weapon.${prompt};
Except I don't deal in that kind of sissy cleaning stuff.;
Weapons for destruction and mayhem. That's all I got.${prompt};
So I told him, if his weapon's gone rusty, he should try taking it to a blacksmith.${prompt};
Then he tells me that's impossible.${prompt};
Why, you ask?;
Your guess is as good as mine.${prompt};
I'm a merchant.;
I don't usually get sucked into my customers' personal affairs.${prompt};
But this Abquhbah...he seemed on the edge of a nervous breakdown.;
So, I told him I'd order in something for the rust, just this once.${prompt};
The thing is, though, I completely forgot to ask what kind of weapon it was.${prompt};
You need different chemicals for different materials, and the wrong chemical can sometimes make the rust worse.${prompt};
So I've been waiting for him to come back so I could ask him.${prompt};
Hey, maybe you could go and find out for me?${prompt};
I'd go myself, but I have to mind my shop.${prompt};
Thanks, buddy, you're a real trooper.${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
(This is the end for me...)${prompt};
Ah!${prompt};
Oh, it's you.;
(I thought my doom had come for me...)${prompt};
Hm? What kind of weapon?${prompt};
...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Abquhbah turns pale...;
He needs to know the type of weapon I need to clean...?${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
Is something wrong?;
That's right.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Abquhbah turns a whiter shade of pale...;
...${prompt};
I can't hide anything from you, can I, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Would you mind accompanying me to the back of the office?${prompt};
There's something I need you to see.${prompt};
Hm? President Naja?;
Not to worry, she's busy meeting with officials from the Commissions Agency.${prompt};
Over here...${prompt};
...${prompt};
This is what I was talking about...${prompt};
Do you see?${prompt};
I've done something monumentally foolish.${prompt};
President Naja entrusted the care of her beloved morning star to me!${prompt};
And now I've somehow managed to let a spot of rust appear...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} peers at the rust spot on Naja's morning star.;
The rust appears to run deep into the metal...;
It was supposed to be just another part of my morning routine.${prompt};
President Naja ordinarily polishes the weapon herself, but she's been so busy recently that I offered to do it for her...${prompt};
Just like usual, I picked up the morning star, intending to buff the points to their regular gleam.${prompt};
Except that yesterday I slept in a little late and didn't really have time to...${prompt};
Um. Oh dear. You'll keep that to yourself, won't you?${prompt};
Anyway, when I was carrying the morning star into the main part of the office...;
I accidentally dropped it!${prompt};
You would think that a big, sturdy weapon like that wouldn't be damaged in the slightest...${prompt};
You would think...${prompt};
But as I picked it up, the icy grip of fear clutched me around the throat.;
There it was, right at the base of one of the spikes...${prompt};
An awful spot of blackrust, staring me right in the face!${prompt};
It must have sprung up because I failed to clean the weapon in the morning...${prompt};
No, the reason doesn't really matter...${prompt};
I know I can't avoid the terrible beating coming my way, but that won't bring back the splendor of President Naja's “spiky friend.”${prompt};
Ugh...;Pouah...
Just thinking about it turns my stomach.${prompt};
I intend to take full responsibility for this failure, and tender my resignation.;
That's the only option left to me...${prompt};
Thank you for your support and understanding, ${name-player}.;
Don't try to stop me...${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
Let's not be hasty.;
There'll be other companies...${prompt};
<Sob>...;
I'll miss this place...${prompt};
${name-player}...;
Do you really think there's hope for me?${prompt};
I mean, look at that rust.;
Resigning is the only way out...${prompt};
What do you say?;
${selection-lines};
We can beat this blackrust!;
You can find another job!${prompt};
Do you really mean it?;
Oh, I knew you'd help me!${prompt};
Sergeant Major ${name-player}, you're my only hope!${prompt};
<Sob>...<whimper>...;
How could I possibly quit when I have such “caring” colleagues?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Abquhbah steals a glance at you...;
Abquhbah, where are ya!?${prompt};
!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
(President Naja is back!)${prompt};
Abquhbah!;
What took ya so long?${prompt};
(Oh dear, someone has rubbed her fur the wrong way today...)${prompt};
I'm tellin' ya, those agency officials are givin' me nothin' but headaches!${prompt};
Who do they think supplies the mercenaries for their missions, anyway!?${prompt};
What are the pair of ya starin' at?;
Do I have milk on my whiskers?${prompt};
Or is it somethin' else?${prompt};
Surely ya aren't keepin' secrrrets from your president?;
Somethin' that's gonna tip me over the edge into a rrreal rrred rrrage?${prompt};
Hmmm?${prompt};
Don't just stand there, say somethin'!${prompt};
Come to think of it...${prompt};
What are ya doin' here anyway, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Ya aren't takin' my absence as an opportunity to laze arrround, yappin' with Abquhbah, are ya?${prompt};
Your continued silence...${prompt};
...is drivin' a knife into my heart.${prompt};
You two are more than just employees to me--you're my dear companions.${prompt};
That's rrright.;
Beloved companions that have joined me on the ship of Salaheem's Sentinels, sailin' the stormy seas of success and sorrow...${prompt};
I'm here, waxin' lyrrrical about our frrriendship, and still you say nothin'...${prompt};
P-P-President Naja!;
I...I...${prompt};
Yes?${prompt};
...${prompt};
I was just about to escort ${name-player} to the door.${prompt};
Bah!${prompt};
Well then, ${name-player}.;
For the “splendor” of President Naja and Salaheem's Sentinels...${prompt};
We had better let you return to that very important “job”...${prompt};
Hmph.;
I'm surrounded by blockheads...${prompt};
I know all there is to know about President Naja's “spiky friend.”${prompt};
I've spent days and days pouring my heart, soul, and spit into keeping that weapon clean.${prompt};
Um, forget about that “spit” part...${prompt};
Ahem. Aside from the spikes, the head of the president's morning star is made entirely of darksteel.;
The weight helps to shatter whatever it is she's hitting...<gulp>.${prompt};
Please convey this information to Hagakoff.;
Hopefully we can find a solution to this spiky problem.;
Sorry...${prompt};
Darksteel?${prompt};
A morning star made of darksteel...${prompt};
And he wants to get rid of a spot of blackrust?${prompt};
Hmmm...${prompt};
Blackrust on darksteel can be a real trial.${prompt};
Compared to other metals, darksteel is fairly rust-resistant. But once that black demon sets in, it'll start to spread with a vengeance...${prompt};
By the time you've noticed blackrust, it's probably eaten to the middle of your weapon.${prompt};
Hmm...${prompt};
There's a cleaner known as “rustkiller” that'll work on darksteel.${prompt};
Problem is, are you willing to give up your firstborn to buy it?${prompt};
The price range is a little out of a mercenary's league, I'd wager.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Now don't lose heart just yet.${prompt};
Do you think I pulled that name out of the air just to depress you?${prompt};
You see, one of the ingredients...${prompt};
What was it again...?;
That's right! Some sorta rare mushroom.${prompt};
Mixing that mushroom with oil will make a cleaner almost as good as the original rustkiller.${prompt};
Hm?;
Can I remember what the mushroom's called?${prompt};
It sounded something like--${prompt};
Hello there, Hagakoff.;
Here's the item you ordered.${prompt};
Ah, Macici.${prompt};
Always a pleasure doing business with you.${prompt};
Oh, by the way...${prompt};
You've heard of that cleaner called “rustkiller,” right?;
What was the name of that rare ingredient again?${prompt};
?${prompt};
You're not thinking of making some yourself, are you, Hagakoff?;
The Alchemists' Guild will drag you before the Imperial Court.${prompt};
Come on, Macici, don't be such a hard case.;
It's just for one little spot of blackrust.${prompt};
...${prompt};
The mushroom you're looking for is a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Ah, that's it!${prompt};
Are you going to tell me who it's for?${prompt};
Hm? Oh, yeah, sure.${prompt};
You see, one of my customers had himself all worked up and...${prompt};
Actually, I could use your help with this one, Macici.${prompt};
<Sigh>.;
You're just a big teddy bear at heart, aren't you, Haga?${prompt};
Go on, then.;
Let's hear it.${prompt};
A darksteel morning star?;
President Naja's morning star?${prompt};
Now I see why he couldn't leave it with the Blacksmiths' Guild for repairs.${prompt};
From what I understand, his ability to continue breathing may depend on this.${prompt};
Well, if you put it that way...${prompt};
Like you say, the only thing that can help here is a good dose of rustkiller.${prompt};
But getting your hands on a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} won't be easy.${prompt};
It's an extremely rare species that only grows in a certain part of the Aydeewa Subterrane--it won't be easy to find.${prompt};
Even then, if the mushroom isn't newly sprouted, you might as well not bother picking it.${prompt};
Rustkiller can't be made with mushrooms that have been growing too long...${prompt};
But, how can you tell if a mushroom has just sprouted or not?${prompt};
There is a way.${prompt};
Once a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} starts to grow, it releases spore clouds.${prompt};
Ah, I get it. That's how the mushroom reproduces.${prompt};
Have you been reading again, Haga?${prompt};
Anyway, the best thing to do is search for a mature ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Once you find one, you should pick it and plant it in some damp soil.${prompt};
The mushroom will eventually release a spore cloud, and before you know it you'll have yourself a newly-sprouted ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}!${prompt};
But where do we find the right kind of soil?${prompt};
If you pay attention to where the other mushrooms are growing, you should be able to figure it out.${prompt};
Hmmm...this sounds like it will take a while.${prompt};
Not as long as you'd think.;
Once the spores from this species of mushroom hit the soil, they sprout at an incredible rate.${prompt};
They should sprout within one day, but you'll get a bigger yield if you pick them early in the morning.${prompt};
Thanks, Macici, you...wait...${prompt};
Hm?${prompt};
How do you know so much about mushrooms, anyway?${prompt};
Even I've had times when the coin wasn't flowing so freely.${prompt};
And I've caused more than one or two spots of rust on darksteel weapons in my time as an apprentice...${prompt};
Heh, hard to imagine you as an apprentice.;
Thanks a bunch, Macici.${prompt};
Think nothing of it.;
Just keep this mushroom business to yourself.${prompt};
And next time, make sure you have the money to get some rustkiller the legitimate way!${prompt};
Right.;
We'll pass that wisdom on to Abquhbah.${prompt};
I better be getting back.;
Good luck!${prompt};
Macici said that we can find a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} in the Aydeewa Subterrane.${prompt};
All you have to do is get your hands on a mature stalk.${prompt};
Stick that in some nice, damp soil, and you should be able to harvest some sprouts within a day.${prompt};
He said that you'll get more mushrooms if you pick them early in the morning...${prompt};
You should probably try for a big batch, just in case.${prompt};
President Naja still hasn't noticed the rust spot.${prompt};
But it's only a matter of time until those poorly cleaned spikes descend upon my head!${prompt};
That's an unusual mushroom you have there, ${name-player}.;
Is it...edible?${prompt};
Oh!?;
That little piece of fungal growth can restore the president's morning star to its former, unflawed glory!?${prompt};
This is wonderful news!;
I knew going to you was the right thing to do!;
(No one else was willing to help...)${prompt};
We must expunge the evidence of my failure at once!${prompt};
President Naja will be leaving for another business meeting today--all we have to do is wait for our chance.${prompt};
Any time now...;
Any...time...${prompt};
Abquhbah!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
(She's on her way out!;
Please wait outside. I'll call you when I'm ready.)${prompt};
Abquhbah!;
How many times do I have to call ya!?${prompt};
C-coming!${prompt};
Listen up.${prompt};
I don't wanna come back and find you've somehow rrruined my day.;
Got it?${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
The office will be waiting for you just as you left it, President Naja!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Okay, ${name-player}.;
You can come in now.${prompt};
Now's our chance!;
Let's see how this miracle cleaner of yours works!${prompt};
We just mix the mushrooms with olive oil, and rub it into the rust, correct?${prompt};
Here's some of the cleaner I prepared earlier.${prompt};
We have enough to polish the morning star ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[time/times].${prompt};
I'll hold the weapon steady for you.${prompt};
Right, ${name-player}.;
Time to start polishing away my shame!${prompt};
Start polishing?;

Ah...not right now.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} vigorously polishes the morning star with the rustkiller!;
Well, that didn't work as well as I expected...${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The morning star is clean, but the rust still remains.;
The blackrust is still there.;
And you say this rustkiller is expensive?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The rust has completely disappeared! It's as shiny as the day it was forged!;
Simply amazing!;
Not a trace of rust to be seen!${prompt};
Shall we try polishing it again?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The morning star seems even shinier than before...;
(Is it possibly more shiny than ever?)${prompt};
Hmm...polish it even more?${prompt};
Hmm...polish until we drop?${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}The gleam on the morning star is enough to blind you!;
I've never seen such an unnatural gleam on the spikes before!${prompt};
It's strangely...thrilling.${prompt};
You weren't a squire to a famous knight in a previous life, were you?${prompt};
Well, well...${prompt};
Having fun, are we?${prompt};
Ab-quh-bah!${prompt};
P-President Naja!;
H-how long have you been standing there!?${prompt};
Y-you're back so early...${prompt};
Did ya rrreally believe I had gone for another meetin' at the Commissions Agency?${prompt};
I...I...${prompt};
The pair of ya have been actin' mighty suspicious lately.${prompt};
So I had one of the employees trail behind ya.${prompt};
I don't need anyone doin' anythin' that will sling mud on the fair name of my company.${prompt};
Y-you had someone trail us...?${prompt};
But what I'm more interested in at the moment...${prompt};
...is why you're holdin' onto my prrrecious morning star!?${prompt};
I...I can explain...${prompt};
So...?${prompt};
So when I went to return your spiky...uh...your morning star to its normal spot, I...${prompt};
A thousand thousand pardons!${prompt};
This is entirely my fault!;
I allowed your beloved morning star...to rust!${prompt};
I see. And then?${prompt};
...?;
I...I'm terribly sorry.${prompt};
That's the end of your rrreport?${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am...${prompt};
Guess I'll have to fire ya, then.${prompt};
Gyah!;
Anything but that!${prompt};
Ah!${prompt};
The evidence...${prompt};
I tried to hide the evidence from you!;
I tried to deceive you!${prompt};
Exactly...${prompt};
And you, ${name-player}.;
Don't think you're off the hook!${prompt};
Please, wait...!${prompt};
The fault all lies with me.;
${name-player} was just trying to help--${prompt};
Hold ya tongue!;
${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] an accomplice to the crrrime!${prompt};

Hmm.${prompt};
You've left me with no other rrrecourse!${prompt};
Abquhbah.${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
Ya understand you'll be makin' rrreparations for this offense?${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am...${prompt};
And you as well, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You're rrresponsible for rrrunnin' the mercenary rrresources of this company.${prompt};
So you'll be rrresponsible for handin' out the verdict!${prompt};
M-me...!?${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am...${prompt};
Sergeant Major ${name-player}.;
You have shown extraordinary resourcefulness and bravery in aiding a fellow Salaheem's Sentinels employee.${prompt};
This selfless behavior is the exact quality espoused in the company charter.${prompt};
Also...${prompt};
(For polishing my prrrecious morning star to such a beautiful shine...)${prompt};
For showing unprecedented loyalty and respect towards the president and her belongings...${prompt};
...and completing an impressive number of official commissions...${prompt};
...you have become eligible to undertake the examination to skip straight to the mercenary officer rank of Second Lieutenant.${prompt};
...${prompt};
H-however...${prompt};
Despite your good intentions, you have acted independently and in violation of the company regulations...${prompt};
And so...!${prompt};
These offenses revoke your eligibility for Second Lieutenant...${prompt};
...and result in a one-step promotion to Chief Sergeant!${prompt};
Nicely done, Abquhbah!${prompt};
Congrrratulations on your prrromotion, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Congratulations!;
(I think I need some water...)${prompt};
Chief Sergeant ${name-player}.;
You've imprrressed me.${prompt};
I think I'll have you polish my morning star from now on!${prompt};
${name-player}.;
I apologize for dragging you into all this.${prompt};
Here's your promotion bonus.${prompt};
There's this, as well.;
A special bonus from the president!${prompt};
Things were a little hairy for a while there, but everything turned out for the best.${prompt};
So, Chief Sergeant ${name-player}.${prompt};
I think it's time to take that bonus and put this incident behind us with a fine meal!${prompt};
Now, if I can just slip--${prompt};
Abquhbah!${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
You're headed for a different destination, aren't ya?${prompt};

Take a brrroom and go clean it out.${prompt};
Y-yes, ma'am!${prompt};
${color-alt: 138}${name-player} has been promoted to Chief Sergeant!${prompt};
Oh...;

I'll just put this back, then.${prompt};

Before the president gets back...${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
P-President Naja!;
Welcome back!${prompt};
She...didn't say anything.${prompt};
This might a good time to make yourself scarce.;
I won't think any less of you.${prompt};
After all, it's not good to anger President Naja twice in one day...${prompt};
I wonder why she came back so early?${prompt};
Bah...${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Polish it again later.;
That's enough.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}There is no rustkiller left.;
Well, all the rust is gone as far as I can see, but...${prompt};

M-Madam President, forgive meeeeeeeee!${prompt};
Don't give me those pleadin' little kitten eyes, ${name-player}.;

No need ta thank me. Just don't spend it all in one place, ya hear?${prompt};
Incredible, Madam President! Truly, your generosity knows no bounds!${prompt};
It's not every day that a mercenary earns a bonus from President Naja herself.;

Of all the incompetent...!;
!;
Uh-oh!;Oh-oh !
You!!!;
I can't watch!;
${name-player}!?${prompt};
Oh dear, oh dear...${prompt};
Can you hear me?;
Hang in there, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Nine hundred years...${prompt};
For nine hundred years, emperors down through history have dreamed of seeing the scattered remnants of the iron colossus thus brought together.${prompt};
For this purpose alone, we have fought in countless, fruitless conflicts, both within and without the Empire, in search of the lost candescences...${prompt};
It has been an epic, if pointless, struggle.${prompt};
But my father had a different vision.${prompt};
Yes. It was the innovative Emperor Jalzahn that devised the notion of manufacturing a colossus, as well as the candescences, using our own resources and technology.${prompt};
“There is always a way. If you cannot find one, create one.”${prompt};
Another of his famous sayings...${prompt};
And you, my Lord Razfahd, are doing a splendid job of following in his footsteps.${prompt};
Spare me your platitudes.;
My father's idea was merely a catalyst.${prompt};
I have my own vision--my own path to glory.${prompt};
I meant no offense, Grand Vizier...${prompt};
How can we know that Alexander will choose to manifest in our mechanical giant, as he once infused the iron colossus?${prompt};
This is not the time to waver.;
It is said that Alexander only favors the strongest among us.${prompt};
According to my calculations, our mechanical creation has many times the destructive power of the Alzadaal construct.${prompt};
I have no doubts concerning its worthiness.;
Alexander is but awaiting the moment of his resurrection...${prompt};
Everything I have worked towards has been in preparation for that glorious day.${prompt};
Yes, it will be glorious...${prompt};
But we cannot jump ahead of ourselves.;
First we must unravel the Gordeus.${prompt};
The Gordeus...;
What an unexpected taste of irony.${prompt};
Who would have suspected she had made such modifications to the automatons I designed?${prompt};
It was an oversight on our part.;
Nashmeira's mother Jubleel was an eccentric woman, but none could fault her intelligence.${prompt};
Yes, a brilliant scholar.${prompt};
Before I enlisted her as my pupil, Jubleel was well known in the academic community for her work in deciphering complicated scrolls of Walahran philosophy.${prompt};
When I was still a boy, she also instructed me in arts of the puppetmaster.${prompt};
The device she invented to instill behavioral patterns made it simple for even a beginner like myself to make Mnejing move in the most lifelike manner.${prompt};
Ah, the concept of “programming.”;
I must admit to being dumbstruck by her ideas.${prompt};
If we had only realized how much truth was contained in her ramblings.${prompt};
“Everything is born from the Gordeus...”${prompt};
What of Nashmeira?${prompt};
She remains secluded in her chambers, Grand Vizier.${prompt};
Stubborn child.${prompt};
Your orders?${prompt};
Tell her this:${prompt};
If she cooperates in unlocking the puppets' secrets, I will reconsider Luzaf's fate.${prompt};
Should she refuse, we will have no choice but to dismantle Ovjang and Mnejing for Ghatsad to analyze.${prompt};
Understood.${prompt};
Keep a strict guard--she is not to slip away again.${prompt};
Sir.${prompt};
Do you truly mean to release Luzaf?${prompt};
Of course not.${prompt};
However, “he” reappeared just as we were completing the mechanical colossus--it can be no coincidence.${prompt};
You believe there is some connection...?${prompt};
It is possible.${prompt};
And until we know the significance of this connection, I intend to keep Luzaf alive.${prompt};
But if he--${prompt};
Do not worry.;
I will not allow this underworld apocalypse of theirs to occur.${prompt};
All the keys to the Age of Judgment lie in the palm of my hand.${prompt};
I will keep him under control--even should he become the incarnation of a god.${prompt};
${name-player} appears to be coming around!;
Phew, I'm glad ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] okay...${prompt};
You're...“glad”...?${prompt};
Ahem!;
Finally wakin' up, is ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?;
Guess I don't know my own strrrength!${prompt};
(I must have imagined that glimpse of compassion...)${prompt};
Isn't there something you'd like to say to ${name-player}?${prompt};
I...uh...that is to say...${prompt};
It's all Duzaf's fault.;
This doesn't qualify ya for worker's compensation!${prompt};
President Naja!${prompt};
S-sorry about crrracking your head, ${name-player}...${prompt};
N-now, don't ya have some sorta rrreport for me? Hm?${prompt};
What do you have to report?;
${selection-lines};
Aphmau's “message.”;
The truth of Naja's suspicions.${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Why didn't ya say somethin'!?${prompt};
Why didn't ya tell me about that first!?${prompt};
Alrrready...?;
Things are moving too fast...${prompt};
Hm?;
This is not for the likes of you two!;
Now scoot for a bit so's I can concentrrrate!${prompt};
Oho.${prompt};
So Duzaf was rrreally Luzaf.${prompt};
I knew I was rrright...${prompt};
But ya were collared by the admiral and sent to guard the corsairs' hideout...${prompt};
Then ya barely escape with your life, and now ya think you're bein' hunted.${prompt};
So ya were afrrraid to rrreport in until the scary Admiral Luzaf was caught, is that it?${prompt};
Of all the spineless, gutless...;
And ya call yourself a Salaheem's Sentinel!?${prompt};
A corsairs' hideout...;
Hmmm...${prompt};
<Sniff, sniff>...${prompt};
Is something wrong, President Naja?${prompt};
I thought I caught the scent of gold in the air.${prompt};
But gold doesn't have a scent...${prompt};
I guess I must've imagined it.;
<Sniff, sniff>...${prompt};
What's come over the president?;
She never wants to spend time “thinking.”${prompt};
I hope all this “thinking” doesn't lead to one of her tantrums.${prompt};
Well, at least the loss of Duzaf's bounty seems to have blown over without any casualties.${prompt};
Oh, I didn't mean to make light of your injury, ${name-player}...${prompt};
Y-you take care of that bump!${prompt};
${name-player}.;
I am glad to have found you.${prompt};
I have urgent news.${prompt};
Please accompany me to Balrahn Way.${prompt};
The Divine Empress Nashmeira II has been stripped of her authority, and the Grand Vizier now controls the government...${prompt};
Events have transpired just as His Highness had feared they would.${prompt};
The prince is acquainted with the current Empress, having once accepted an invitation to visit Aht Urhgan as a guest of the state.${prompt};
I know nothing of the events that occurred during that time...${prompt};
However, His Highness is fervently confident of Empress Nashmeira's ability to navigate a righteous course for her nation.${prompt};
Sir Travialce.${prompt};
Isn't this place a little open for holding an emergency council!?${prompt};
Aren't you worried about spies in the crowd!?;
What if we were targeted for random surveillance!?${prompt};
A pleasure to see you again, Rodin-Comidin.${prompt};
Oh, and by the way, I've been ordered to cease all exchanges of information with non-Windurstian agents.${prompt};
We've discovered some facts about the Astral Candescence that would knock the starch out of your stuffy Elvaan shirt!${prompt};
Ah!;
Doctor Shan...ah, Lady Karababa forbade me to speak of it to anyone!${prompt};
Wait! What's that delightful aroma?;
I think I smell kebabs...${prompt};
I'll just mosey on over and grab a bite to eat while we're waiting for everyone to get here!${prompt};
Whoa!${prompt};
Lady Ayame!${prompt};
What a pleasant surprise.;
I did not expect a Mythril Musketeer to attend...${prompt};
Bastok recognizes that the situation has grown beyond the scope of simple intelligence gathering.${prompt};
Meaning?${prompt};
Meaning that Strategic Command has ordered the Bastokan Navy to prepare for war.${prompt};
Prepare for war?;
Are you not acting prematurely...?${prompt};
Wake up and smell the chai, Travialce.;
Windurst has already deployed her amphibious Cardians.${prompt};
This speculation is not constructive.;
If everyone is present, I suggest we discuss the main agenda.${prompt};
I have heard no word from Gessho...${prompt};
Excuse my bluntness of speech, but we do not have the luxury of time to wait for latecomers.${prompt};
Let's get this over with.${prompt};
The situation we had all hoped to avoid now looms before us.${prompt};
Then it has been decided.${prompt};
Yes. An allied forces military council will be called into session.${prompt};
Such a council has not been held since the end of the Great War...${prompt};
Our main prerogative is to avoid the commencement of hostilities.${prompt};
As a step towards this objective, I propose an open forum for the exchange of information.${prompt};
I agree.;
Is there anything you would like to share with us, ${name-player}?${prompt};
You have infiltrated the deepest layer of Imperial government, if I'm not mistaken?${prompt};
What do you speak of?;
${selection-lines};
Razfahd's message.;
Recent events.${prompt};
Conflict may be unavoidable...${prompt};
This threatens to escalate into war on a scale greater than any in history.${prompt};
The loss of life will be incalculable...;
It cannot be...;
The incarnation of Odin?${prompt};
And the Empress held prisoner by her own subjects...${prompt};
No!;Non!
The bounty on Duzaf's head has been withdrawn?${prompt};
Was there anything else of import, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Doo da doo da doo♪.${wait-36: 2};
Duzaf will be mine♪.${prompt};
Can ya imagine it, ${name-player}?;
With that kind of capital, I'll be able to build a string of offices in the Middle Lands.${prompt};
San d'Oria, Bastok...hell, even Olzhirya, way to the south...${prompt};
I'm gonna have to pass on Windurst, though.${prompt};
So...;
I don't wanna see any slackin' in your efforts to uncover Duzaf's trrrue, accurate, one-hundred-percent-certain identity!${prompt};
Hm?;
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
No idea what you're talkin' about.${prompt};

Nah...${prompt};
No idea, I told ya!;
Out with ya! Out!${prompt};
Hehehe...${prompt};
It's okay to be impressed.${prompt};
For I, Rodin-Comidin, am the most resourceful espionage agent ever to tremble in fear before Doctor Shan...ahem.${prompt};
No other agent is willing to brave my simit and water diet so they can afford to buy all their information from the Qiqirn rumormongers...${prompt};
${name-player}-san!;
This debug message will self-destruct in 20 seconds...${prompt};
Why, hello there! My   name's   Nadeee   Periyaha, and   I'm    a    mercenareee.${prompt};
Oh! Am I doing it again? I wonder why...?${prompt};
Maybe...${prompt};
Maybe it's something about you that   reminds   meee   of   my   Qiqirn   buddeees   back   in   Nashmau...${prompt};
You see!? There I go again!${prompt};
What ever could be wrong with me today...?${prompt};
Hm? You say you are looking for a Mithra who used to live in Nashmau?${prompt};
Who ever could that be...?${prompt};
You think that it could be me!?${prompt};
Because   I   sometimes   speeek   slowly   like   Qiqirn,   no?${prompt};
Oh! Then I guess you've found your woman!${prompt};
Yes, it's true. I used to live and work on that lonely island to the north...${prompt};
After just a few weeks with the little fellas, I was extending my eee's and stretching out my ooo's like I was one of the family.${prompt};
It took me months   tooo   get   back   tooo   normal... Well, close to normal...${prompt};
But enough of the history lesson. Why were you looking for me in the first place?${prompt};
There's a little girl who wants to be friends with the Qiqirn? How adorable!${prompt};
And so the little princess's parents are looking for someone who can teach her how to get along with the 'Roons.${prompt};
Well, I guess you came to the right lady!${prompt};
I'm the closest thing you'll get to a Qiqirn without the beady eyes, red nose, pot belly, and mysterious waist pack.${prompt};
Not that I'm proud of it or anything...${prompt};
Alright, you've convinced me. I'll try to tell you what you need to know.${prompt};
If you want to lure a Qiqirn out of hiding, you'll first need to learn how to talk like one.${prompt};
You know, like the ancient Far Eastern proverb says, “When in Rolanberry, one must eat the rolanberries.”${prompt};
Oh! Nadeee! Nadeee!${prompt};

Ummm... Hrmmm...${prompt};
Cacaroon got cheeep info, ya?;
Yooo got “clink clink”? Cacaroon got big info!${prompt};
Cacaroon help, ya? Cacaroon use network. Cacaroon find help!${prompt};
Ah, a mercenary. Just who I have been looking for.${prompt};
I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer me truthfully.${prompt};
Have you heard of Clavauert B Chanoix?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I read the Tribune.;
No. Reading is for wimps.${prompt};
Excellent, then I won't waste your time by giving you a history lesson.${prompt};
You've never heard of the baron? Where have you been the past few years, off in some virtual fantasy world?${prompt};
Clavauert B Chanoix is a famous zoologist from the Middle Lands.${prompt};
He is currently visiting the Imperial realm on an expedition researching the behavioral patterns of various animals native to this continent.${prompt};
The Empress has made it policy to officially sponsor the baron, and has ordered us to assist him in any way necessary.${prompt};
Her Excellence feels that not only will his research provide a treasure trove of valuable information on the Empire's ecosystem...${prompt};
...but also help us better defend ourselves.${prompt};
Why is that, you ask?${prompt};
Simply put, data on the monsters living in the area will aid us in determining the best plan of action to take when threatened by the foul fiends.${prompt};
In the past weeks, the baron has been focusing his research on the recently discovered Poroggo. He is currently planning a trip into Mamook to take a closer look at the new species.${prompt};
And that is where the Empire requires your help. We need someone to act as a bodyguard for Professor Chanoix while he collects his data.${prompt};
You need worry not. A hefty reward will be provided for your services, in addition to the fame and glory you will receive by accepting such an important mission.${prompt};
Well, what is your answer, mercenary?${prompt};
Accept the job?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
Not now.${prompt};
Understood. However, if you have a change of heart, the position will remain open until we find another volunteer.${prompt};
Wonderful. I will contact the baron right awa--${prompt};
Ah!${prompt};
Maudaal. Have you not yet found me a bodyguard? I do grow weary of these gray walls and long to step back out into the wild woods of Wajaom.${prompt};
Baron Chanoix! Your timing is impeccable!${prompt};
This fine citizen has just volunteered for the position.${prompt};
Excellent! Now I can finally continue my research.${prompt};
First, let me inform you of the focal point of this expedition.${prompt};
Are you familiar with the peculiar beastman known as the Poroggo?${prompt};
Are you?;
${selection-lines};
I'm an expert!;
Prego?${prompt};
Is that so? You adventurers never cease to amaze me with your knowledge of the world.${prompt};
You mean to tell me that you have no prior knowledge of the Poroggo?${prompt};
And you believe that this uneducated commoner will be able to effectively assist me in my research?${prompt};
Well, that is of no matter. At least you were honest about your ignorance--unlike my friend Maudaal here...${prompt};
Now listen carefully, as I shall give you a quick overview of the data I have collected thus far.${prompt};
You had best write this down!${prompt};
Yes, I first came across the creatures when excavating a stratum of soil deep beneath Windurst Waters. In a layer we estimated to be nearly a hundred years old, my team discovered a large quantity of strangely shaped bones.${prompt};
At first glance, they resembled the remains of large toads. However...${prompt};
Measurements of the skulls showed us that the creatures had exceptionally large brains.${prompt};
But that was not all--the forelegs seemed to be developed to the point that they might be used to grasp objects...${prompt};
Whereas the hind legs seemed more suited for walking than the traditional jumping one might expect from an amphibious land dweller.${prompt};
That was when I realized that we had not found the bones of a common toad, but a completely new and unique species!;
I can sense what you are thinking...${prompt};
It was as if we had discovered something directly from the pages of the well-known fairy tale, “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt};
And it is indeed from the famous frog princess, Poroggo, that we took the name for our new beastman.${prompt};
My theory was that over millions of years, the toads of Sarutabaruta adapted to their surroundings and evolved into this higher life form.${prompt};
However!;
I immediately took my findings to the Board of Akademia in Jeuno, but the fools simply laughed at me!${prompt};
Yes, it is true, I had no explanation for the discovery of “unevolved” toad bones near those of the Poroggo...${prompt};
But I knew that there had to be evidence that remained yet uncovered.${prompt};
There had to be a “missing link” that would prove my theory!${prompt};
And then, one day while poring over some of the Optistery's more sensitive tomes, I came across a most intriguing passage.${prompt};
It said that...${prompt};
...the Poroggo we found in Windurst Waters...${prompt};
...they were actually toads transformed into hideous creatures by the forbidden magicks of an eccentric mage named Samariri!${prompt};
It was difficult to accept that my original theory was incorrect.${prompt};
However, as a scientist, it was the only choice with which I was left.${prompt};
After my failure in Sarutabaruta, I felt I needed to put some distance between myself and the Middle Lands.${prompt};
And that is when I decided to pack up my equipment and ventured forth here, to Aradjiah, in search of new knowledge.${prompt};
And until recently, I have kept myself quietly busy with studies of the colibri and the chigoe.${prompt};
That is until I received word of a Poroggo sighting in the Mamool Ja Savagelands!${prompt};
According to the ancient tome I found in Windurst, all the Poroggo were exterminated by the Federation's mages immediately after their “accidental” creation. Though, ever since I discovered a peculiar footprint near the bungalow of my acquaintance, Pabool Ja, I have begun to believe otherwise.${prompt};
Recently, there have even been adventurer reports of toadlike creatures residing in the damper areas of the Mamool Ja stronghold.${prompt};
What I would like to find out is where these beastmen came from.${prompt};
Are they descendants of the Poroggo spawned from the spellweaving of some spoiled Tarutaru?${prompt};
Or, are they a completely different species, evolved from mere toads as stated in my original theory?${prompt};
And! How are they able to transform their unexpecting victims into frogs?${prompt};
The only way to come to satisfactory scientific conclusions is through research!${prompt};
And research requires time!!${prompt};
And so I planned an expedition into the savagelands to search out the elusive Poroggos and witness firsthand the instant a victim falls prey to their unique ${color: 5}frog song${color: 1}.${prompt};
But before I could set out on this trip, I required a volunteer...${prompt};
...to be that victim!${prompt};
Ah, I'm sorry if I alarmed you. Your services will only be required to fend off...unwanted guests.${prompt};
The noble Salwa-Molwa will be our guinea...er...toad.${prompt};
So this is our mighty mercenary? Looks a bit scrawny, if you ask me.${prompt};
I'm Salwa-Molwa.${prompt};
I'll be helping the professor out with his experiment.${prompt};
All you have to do is keep us alive while we're collecting the dataru.${prompt};
Think you can handle that?${prompt};
Salwa!${prompt};
Mikilulu!? What are you doing here?${prompt};
Are you really thinking about going through with this crazy scheme? What if you become a frog forever!?${prompt};
What are you worried about, baby? I've got the baron to protect me...and this mercenary, too. They'll help me out of any jam.${prompt};
How am I supposed to trust a so-called professor who would think of doing experiments on living, breathing Tarutaru!?${prompt};
Hey! Watch your mouth in front of the big B!${prompt};
Professor Chanoix is a respected member of society. Do you think he'd do anything to harm his fellow man?${prompt};
And think of this mercenary's feelings!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] looks like ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] hasn't had any decent work for months. You wouldn't want to ruin this for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] now, would you?${prompt};
And what about my feelings!? Are you saying that I'm too weak to find a way to break a measly frog curse on my own? Well, bring it on, I say!${prompt};
If you'd like to know, I've been spending the last eight days practicing on how to act once I'm transformed. So there!${prompt};
Ribbit, ribbit, baby!${prompt};
Huh!?${prompt};
How is practicing to be a frog going to help you return to normal!?${prompt};
It's... Uh... Um... What do you know, anyway!?${prompt};
You see, the real reason I'm doing this is for the green! The gil, baby!${prompt};
I don't care about any money!${prompt};
Can't you see I'm just worried about your safety!?${prompt};
Pshhh. Whatever.;
Now scram, sweetcheeks. We men've got important business to attend to.${prompt};
Ugh! I don't know why I put up with you!${prompt};
But let me just say one thing before I go...${prompt};
If you come back a frog...${prompt};
...you won't be getting any more sugar from this candy cane!${prompt};
What's with her?${prompt};
I was kind of hoping that if I was stuck as a frog, she'd kiss me and I'd magically transform back to normal...just like in that fairy tale.${prompt};
<Grumble, grumble>...${prompt};
Ah! Oh! A thousand apologies, Professor Chanoix!${prompt};
Mikilulu obviously cannot fathom the importance of your research (or the reward that accompanies it).${prompt};
You don't need to worry, sir! I'm still your loyal servant!${prompt};
Though I'm unworthy to even kneel in the light of your zoological greatness...${prompt};
...I'll be the best guinea toad you've ever worked with!${prompt};
That's the spirit, Salwa-Molwa! I'm counting on you!${prompt};
Now, as for our rendezvous point. Are you familiar with the secret exit to the Wajaom Woodlands?${prompt};
I shall be waiting there for the both of you.${prompt};
And do not be late!${prompt};
Hey, mercenary-${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady], I know you probably took this job for the reward, but I'd like to ask you...${prompt};
Do you think there's anything in this world more important than money?${prompt};
Well do you?;
${selection-lines};
Yeah. Puppies are pretty nice.;
No. Even puppies pale to money.${prompt};
You see...;
When this job's over, I'm going to ask my sweetheart Mikilulu to marry me.${prompt};
That's why I'm going through with this. I'm not doing it for the money like I said.${prompt};
It's just, I can't tell Mikilulu that yet.${prompt};
Getting married is a serious thing, but I don't think I'm ready yet. I'm still the same, weak boy that got his butt kicked on the Ballista courts back at boarding school.${prompt};
Before I even try to prove to Miki that I can protect her, I have to prove to myself that I can.${prompt};
See? I know what I'm doing! I just wish Miki understood as well...${prompt};
I mean, I can see why she is worried and all, but I didn't think she would be so unreasonable!${prompt};
I guess I could sit her down and explain everything, but then she'd just get all teary-eyed like she always does...${prompt};
Oh, sorry about that.${prompt};
I didn't mean to put any extra pressure on you or anything. (Though, Miki would be devastated if anything were to happen to me on this mission...)${prompt};
Anyway, Miki's happiness is riding on my performance here.${prompt};
And if I have to become a frog thirty times over to prove my love to her, then so be it!${prompt};
Once you've made your preparations, you know where to meet me and the B.${prompt};
See you around!${prompt};
Ah, quite punctual of you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
“As swift as a raptor,” one might say.${prompt};
I should expect nothing less from a seasoned mercenary like yourself.${prompt};
Now, if only all my help were as competent...${prompt};
Where on Vana'diel could that nimwit be!?${prompt};
You're late, ${name-player}! “As laggard as a wamouracampa,” one might say.${prompt};
And you call yourself a mercenary... It is a wonder the Empire can thrive when protected by such a pitiful army of skivers.${prompt};
If you were working with my research team, you'd be fired before you stepped in the door. Why, you even make that assistant of mine, Atelloune, look like the Goddess Herself!${prompt};
And it seems your tendency towards tardiness is not necessarily a unique trait...${prompt};
Late! Late! Late!;
I'm gonna be lataru!;
Ulp! You guys haven't been waiting too long for me, I hope.${prompt};
Ahem!;
I apologize deeply for my delayed arrival, and humbly beg your forgiveness.${prompt};
Salwa the Unworthy, at your service.${prompt};
I would've been here earlier, but I thought we were supposed to meet at the exit to Bhaflau!;
Fool!${prompt};
How many times have I told you, I am not a man to be kept waiting!${prompt};
Or perhaps you thought we were going on a picnic to the countryside?${prompt};
Look at this fine mercenary, all ready to embark on our important mission. At least one of you has some sense of responsibility.${prompt};
Do not forget, Salwa-Molwa, there are thousands more Tarutaru where you came from. I'm sure I can find another to assist me!${prompt};
I-I'm sorry, Your Professorship! Please forgive me! It won't happen again!${prompt};
You are lucky I don't bend you across my knee and give you a good flogging! Maybe that would teach you a lesson!${prompt};
I seriously worry about the success of my research...${prompt};
But enough of this idle chit-chat. I guess there is only one way to see if you have truly learned your lesson.${prompt};
${name-player}. Am I safe to assume that you are familiar with the quickest route to Mamo--?;
<Yawn>...${prompt};
What sort of enchantment is this?${prompt};
Hm? Where is our little friend!?${prompt};
${name-player}! And you call yourself a bodyguard! It has been less than an hour and you have already succeeded in losing one of my team!${prompt};
Luckily it was just Salwa, but what if it had been me!?${prompt};
While I do not like the idea of losing precious research time...${prompt};
...I suppose we should locate the lost chap.${prompt};
However, I haven't the slightest of ideas where to begin searching.${prompt};
What about you? Did you happen to see anything while you were lounging there on the leaves?${prompt};
I thought I saw...;
${selection-lines};
A toad chasing a Poroggo!;
A Tarutaru chasing a toad!;
A Tarutaru chasing a Poroggo!${prompt};
Amazing!;
You say you saw an actual Poroggo!?${prompt};
Let me see... Then we can assume the toad you saw chasing after it would be none other than Salwa-Molwa!${prompt};
......;
How dare he go and transform without allowing me time to make my observations! If he is still expecting pay in full for this debacle, then he is gravely mistaken!${prompt};
You say you witnessed a Tarutaru chasing a toad?${prompt};
We can assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world has he chosen to run off and leave us here?${prompt};
Perhaps the toad placed a powerful charm spell on him... But why would it do that?${prompt};
No... I believe this is the scheming of a Poroggo.${prompt};
You must have simply mistaken the beastman for a common toad--an oversight easily understandable, coming from an uneducated lay${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] such as yourself.${prompt};
What is this!?;
You say you witnessed a Tarutaru pursuing a Poroggo!?${prompt};
We can safely assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world would he be chasing away the very beastman we seek?${prompt};
There is also the possibility that he was put under a powerful charm spell... But if that is indeed the case, why wasn't he transformed into a toad as well...?${prompt};
Either way, it seems best if we continue our expedition as planned.${prompt};
If a Poroggo truly was involved in Salwa's disappearance, then we shall find both of them in Mamook.${prompt};
My data tells us that the Poroggo mating grounds lie in an area accessible from an entrance located on the western side of this forest.${prompt};
Now let us make haste.${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Perhaps this encounter with the Poroggo is a blessing in disguise.${prompt};
However, if that is the case, why did they kidnap that useless Salwa?${prompt};
Hm!?;
This whole situation is quite similar to that old fairy tale...${prompt};
I'm sure you have heard of it: “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt};
One day, a young Tarutaru is in the forest collecting toadstools when the frog princess, Poroggo, falls in love with the poor boy and carries him away to her underwater kingdom.${prompt};
Though Salwa-Molwa is not exactly what you could call “young,” I can't imagine anyone, even an amphibian, taking a fancy in that numbskull.${prompt};
Oh, do not misunderstand me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I'm not saying that this fairy tale has any basis in truth.${prompt};
The act of mixing fact with fiction has no place in the world of science.${prompt};
Truth can only be defined as what we can see with our own eyes, grasp with our own hands.${prompt};
There must be a logical explanation for what happened to Salwa.${prompt};
It is just that we have yet to determine it.${prompt};
Now, off to Mamook!${prompt};
Pro～fe～sso～r!;
Hm!?;
Mikilulu! She's-- I've-- It's-- We've-- Toad!${prompt};
Well, if it isn't Salwa-Molwa...${prompt};
${name-player} and I were just about to set off in search of you.${prompt};
However, it seems that you, in turn, have found us. All's well that ends well, I suppose.${prompt};
Now, why don't you calm down and explain to us what has befallen you...starting with that unfortunate occurrence in Wajaom.${prompt};
You see, you two were still sleeping when I recovered from the spell. I looked around to see if I couldn't spot the fiend that had put us in this predicament...${prompt};
...when I saw my precious Mikilulu...${prompt};
...being turned into a frog!${prompt};
I tried to catch her so you could help break the curse, but for some reason, she started hopping off in the direction of Mamook!;
I knew ${name-player} would take care of you, Professor, so I left you two there in the woods to chase after Miki.;
So it was just as you explained, ${name-player}.${prompt};
(You must have the eyes of a pugil, ${name-player}. His account of the events is absolutely nothing like what you claim to have seen!)${prompt};
Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.${prompt};
And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...${prompt};
...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!${prompt};
And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!;
Hmmm... An interesting story...${prompt};
Though one aspect of the tale makes little sense--what was this female acquaintance of yours doing in the Wajaom Woodlands in the first place?${prompt};
I don't know. She didn't tell me...;
I can only guess it was because she was worried about the experiment.${prompt};
Oh! Why did it have to be Miki!? I was the one that was supposed to be transformed!${prompt};
How scared she must be...${prompt};
Calm down, calm down. Now, tell us what happened next.${prompt};
Well, after what seemed like hours of chasing, the Poroggo finally ducked away into this cave...${prompt};
...and that's when I lost him...${prompt};
I thought about searching for the frogman myself, but this place is crawling with hungry-looking Mamool Ja, and I wasn't planning on being a snack for those snakes.${prompt};
Understood.;
We are left with no other choice than to locate and rescue this Mikilulu.${prompt};
But how, Professor?${prompt};
My recent studies of Poroggo behavior have led me to the following conclusions regarding the removal of their curses.${prompt};
The first is that the effects of the frog song will simply wear off after time.${prompt};
If we can catch your lady friend, then we need simply wait in a safe location until she returns to normal.${prompt};
The second of my conclusions is a tad more dramatic.${prompt};
In theory, the spell of the frog song can also be broken...${prompt};
...by slaying its caster.${prompt};
While I hope it will not come to this, we may be forced to resort to violence if the Poroggo in question is not as cooperative as we may like.${prompt};
Now, I am a man of science. I could never resort to killing a fellow living creature. That is where you come in, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now, as for distinguishing 'your' toad from a more common specimen...${prompt};
Professor! I think I can tell which one is my Miki!${prompt};
I mean, I did chase her through the forest for almost an hour.${prompt};
But even so, I'd know my own fiancee anywhere--frog or not!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
While I do not question your feelings towards Mikilulu...${prompt};
...I am wary of basing our search efforts on the memory of a Tarutaru who cannot even remember at which gate he is to convene.${prompt};
If only there were another, more reliable method...${prompt};
And what do we have here!?;
Toadprints! And quite fresh, by my calculations.${prompt};
Salwa, my boy. Have you seen any other toads in the vicinity since arriving?${prompt};
I-- No... I haven't!${prompt};
Then by process of elimination, we can deduce that the prints here belong to none other than Mikilulu!${prompt};
Whoa!;Ouah !
I guess that's why they call you “Professor”!${prompt};
But...;
This place is huge. Where do we start looking?${prompt};
You need not worry, son. Poroggo are an amphibious species, meaning they cannot survive long out of water.${prompt};
To the west of our current location lies a small lake that is rumored to be one of their breeding grounds. We shall first try our luck there.${prompt};
And if anything attempts to attack us, I am sure our trusty mercenary here will handle it.${prompt};
Another toadprint!;
And exactly the same shape as the last! I feel we are getting close...${prompt};
And here is another!${prompt};
But this one is considerably larger... No doubt from the Poroggo that abducted the poor Mikilulu. This suggests that they are still traveling together.${prompt};
I found her!!!;
I do not see any Poroggo in the area.;
Hurry! We must capture her while she is alone!${prompt};
Let me make sure her print is the same as the one at the entrance.${prompt};
Yes... A perfect match!${prompt};
Yes!;
Mikimiki! Why did you go and run away from your Salwa? You don't know how worried I was!${prompt};
So, Professor. Now all we have to do is wait for the spell to wear off naturally, right?${prompt};
Correct. Though, I highly recommend we do so at a location safer than this.${prompt};
Look out!;
Ugh!;
Hmmm... Just as I had feared.${prompt};
Wait! Come back here, you stinky, slimy frogman!;
Stop!${prompt};
Gwahhh!${prompt};
I--I don't think I can handle this guy by myself... He's all yours, ${name-player}!;
Save my Mikilulu!;
You did it! Now Miki will...${prompt};
What the...?${prompt};
I do not understand... The spell should have been broken the instant the caster became incapacitated.${prompt};
Does this mean...we killed the wrong one!?;
Hmmm...;
The print is the same as the one we saw near Mikilulu's.${prompt};
I also believe I witnessed your lady friend respond to one of the Poroggo's commands during the battle.${prompt};
Finally, you can see that the subject has calmed down quite considerably since her captor's defeat.${prompt};
Then if this is really Miki, and that is really the culprit, then why is she still a toad!?${prompt};
That, my boy, I cannot say. My data has never failed me before...${prompt};
But... But...${prompt};
But what about waiting for the spell to wear off? You said that would work, right?${prompt};
Yes, and I also said that slaying the caster would break the curse...${prompt};
Eh!?${prompt};
Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt};
First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.${prompt};
This reaction continues until the whole body is affected, thus reducing him or her to the shape of the assailant.${prompt};
The concept is much similar to that behind the strange liquid medium that transforms its consumer into the shape of a Mamool Ja.${prompt};
Now, whether the sound waves of the frog song actually carry the medium...${prompt};
...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.${prompt};
That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt};
As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt};
We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt};
I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt};
By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt};
The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.${prompt};
To put it in layman's terms...${prompt};
To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt};
In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt};
In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt};
And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt};
However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt};
Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt};
Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt};
The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt};
Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt};
While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt};
Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt};
For example, if a large portion of Mikilulu's conscious had been dedicated to thinking of, and or, worrying about toads, then her mind may have become dependant on the Poroggo's signal and thus began reproducing it out of necessity when the original signal stopped.${prompt};
Eh!?${prompt};
In any case, finding a cure will require months, maybe years of new research.${prompt};
I am sorry, Salwa, but you shall just have to wait until then to reunite with your lady friend.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But you need not fear, my friend, for I shall dedicate myself to finding a solution to this predicament.${prompt};
You have my word as a scientist!${prompt};
P-Professor! Let me help you!${prompt};
I'll do anything!;
I mean, I don't know much about zoology, but there's got to be something I can do!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
I conduct a very strict program. I require the utmost in discipline from my assistants.${prompt};
Discipline is my middle name! I won't let you down!${prompt};
But can I trust you...?${prompt};
Alright. You may temporarily join my research team.${prompt};
T-Thanks B! I...uh, mean, thank you very much, Your Professing Greatness.${prompt};
Now we must hurry back to Al Zahbi and begin conducting tests. Move along, young man! We have little time to waste!${prompt};
Ah, and if I do recall, you have a slight problem with punctuality.${prompt};
That is why I will require you to take up residency in my laboratory's supplies room. Do you have any objections?${prompt};
N-none at all, sir!${prompt};
Alright, Miki. Let's go back to the kind professor's lab, where I'll build you a nice, big cage with grass and rocks and...${prompt};
Oh, and I bet you'll be wanting to take a swim every now and then.${prompt};
Well, you don't have to worry about that. Just croak and I'll dig you your very own swamp, with lily pads and everything!${prompt};
And food! I'll get you whatever you're craving for! What are you craving for? Worms? No, wait moles like worms... What do toads like again? Bugs! That's right!${prompt};
If it's bugs you want, bugs you'll get! I've got a Mog Locker full of shell bugs from that last time I tried to grow some ore.${prompt};
...${prompt};
That's right, Miki. I'll be right by your side until the big B can find a way to turn you back to normal.${prompt};
And then...${prompt};
We can get married and live happily ever after!${prompt};
M-Mikilulu!${prompt};
Amazing!${prompt};
That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.${prompt};
You... You understood what I was saying the whole time?${prompt};
No, not the whole time.${prompt};
But for some reason, those last few words of yours rang out in my head...${prompt};
...and before I knew it, I was back to my old self!${prompt};
Wow... So, all this time you were a frog, you were still thinking of me?${prompt};
I'm sorry, Mikilulu. This is all my fault. If I hadn't made you worry about me being transmutrified into a toad, you wouldn't have had to go through all this.${prompt};
But never again! From now on, I'll protect you from anything that stands in the way of our love...${prompt};
Salwa...${prompt};
...as soon as I finish this job for Professor Clavauert!${prompt};
Your services are no longer required, Salwa-Molwa.${prompt};
Eh? You're not going through with the experiment? But what about your research? What about my paycheck!?${prompt};
What are you talking about? The experiment was a success.${prompt};
Let me sum up my theory for you.${prompt};
Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt};
This ultimately proves that the duration of the frog song depends less on the potency of the Poroggo's cant, and more on the victim's psychological state.${prompt};
And because we now know that the victim's mind is capable of mimicking the Poroggo inhibitor signal...${prompt};
...we can conclude that the song is merely a catalyst, and it is the victim himself that maintains the actual transmogrification.${prompt};
However, we cannot ignore previous data showing symptoms of the toad curse vanishing upon the death of the caster.${prompt};
Therefore, I shall reconstruct my original theories and continue my research to discover a connection between Poroggo neural activity and transmogrification duration.${prompt};
This expedition has spawned more questions than it has answered, but I did learn one thing...${prompt};
...that the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!${prompt};
If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!${prompt};
However, this hypothesis requires much more research before it can be proven. I have much work ahead of me...${prompt};
And... Um... So does this mean I still get my paycheck...?${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Of course it does. And I shall even throw in something extra for Mikilulu's part in all this. Come by my office tomorrow morning at nine o-clock sharp...and do not be late!${prompt};
Th-thank you!${prompt};
Ah yes, and I suppose you'll be wanting your reward as well. I have entrusted your payment with Maudaal in Whitegate. Speak with him when you return to the city.${prompt};
Now let us be off!${prompt};
I had my doubts, but I must say, Maudaal, you are a fine judge of character.${prompt};
This mercenary performed exceptionally on our expedition. I thank you once again.${prompt};
I shall speak personally with your captain and inform her of your accomplishments.${prompt};
Thank you, Professor. That is not necessary.${prompt};
And now, for your “paycheck.”${prompt};
You have earned it, my little friend.${prompt};
Alright!${prompt};
See, Miki! I scored us all this gil!${prompt};
“You” earned us all that gil? Who's the one that was turned into a toad!? That purse of coins should have my name on it!${prompt};
Wait a minute, you've got this all wrong.${prompt};
If it wasn't for me mustering up the bravery to go on the mission in the first place, you wouldn't have followed me into the forest at all!${prompt};
That's right! It's ALL your fault that I was transformed!${prompt};
Hmph!;
You haven't changed a bit!${prompt};
B-But... I... I...;
I'm sorry, Miki...${prompt};
Calm down, Salwa.;
While I am a scientist, I cannot help but believe that fate played a role in all this.${prompt};
Out of passion for my research, I called upon two companions to accompany me to Mamook.${prompt};
Out of love for his soon-to-be better half, Salwa-Molwa chose to embark on this dangerous mission...${prompt};
...as did ${name-player}, whose endless yearnings for adventure brought ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to my side.${prompt};
And finally, you--it was your feelings for Salwa-Molwa that drove you to follow us.${prompt};
It was not until after misfortune had befallen Mikilulu that Salwa-Molwa realized how much he truly cared about her.${prompt};
And it was not until this realization of Salwa's that Mikilulu truly understood what lies deep within his heart.${prompt};
And!;
If it were not for this quaint melodrama, I would still be years behind in my research of the Poroggo, and ${name-player} would probably still be out collecting bat wings.${prompt};
Yes, fate has led us to our proper destinations! (Though, if I had not hired you two in the first place...)${prompt};
Ahem!;
Still, I still cannot comprehend what the Poroggo was thinking when it cast that terrible curse on poor Mikilulu.${prompt};
That's easy, Professor! It was love at first sight!${prompt};
It's the only explanation!${prompt};
You see, even without Miki's toadprints, I was positive I could tell her apart from the other frogs.${prompt};
Why? Because the most beautiful Tarutaru in the world would have to be the most beautiful toad in the world. And only a toad that beautiful would be worthy enough to play the part of Princess Poroggo!${prompt};
Princess Poroggo!? You've got to be kidding!${prompt};
While everything did not quite proceed as planned, I must say, this was one of my more entertaining expeditions.${prompt};
I wish the both of you happiness and good fortune...${prompt};
...even if it means losing one of my best guinea toads. Aha hah hah!;
Guinea toad! Hahahahaha! That was a good one, B!;
Manners, Salwa!${prompt};
Speaking of “good ones,” did you know that he thinks you might actually be more toad than Taru? Bwahahahaha!${prompt};
What are you laughing at!? Do I look like I enjoy eating bugs!?${prompt};
And so, I guess this is adios!${prompt};
Salwa the Unworthy has finally proven his worth.${prompt};
And now I can spend my time protecting the girl I love!${prompt};
And so as of today, I hang up my sword and shield to devote myself to my new family...;
...Good luck, my friends......your endeavors......;
......ake care...and......grib...;
Rgib...;
...bri...;
Ribbit!?${prompt};
(((Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.)));
(((And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...)))${prompt};
(((...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!)));
(((And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!)));
(((...the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!)))${prompt};
(((If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!)));
(((Still, I still cannot comprehend what that Poroggo was thinking when it cast that terrible curse on poor Mikilulu.)));
(((That's easy, Professor! It was love at first sight!)));
(((Why? Because the most beautiful Tarutaru in the world would have to be the most beautiful toad in the world.)));
(((And only a toad that beautiful would be worthy enough to play the part of Princess Poroggo!)));
(((Huh!?)));
(((How is practicing to be a frog going to help you return to normal!?)));
(((That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.)))${prompt};
Goodbye, Professor! Goodbye, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Farewell, my little friend.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
You seem troubled.${prompt};
Is there anything you wish to say?;
${selection-lines};
The Poroggo didn't do anything!;
The true culprit is Mikilulu!;
The girl was a toad all along!;
She's evil, I tell you!;
We have to warn Salwa-Molwa!;
You should be researching her!${prompt};
Aha hah hah!;
You have a keen sense of perception, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I, too, had considered that possibility.${prompt};
However, I lack the evidence required to construct a proper theory.${prompt};
So, why not conduct tests on Mikilulu right away?${prompt};
Listen carefully, ${name-player}. In the world of science, just because new light is shed upon a dark room of questions does not necessarily mean that light will lead you to the answers you seek.${prompt};
Especially when there are still many more lights remaining to examine before racing off blindly after a single one.${prompt};
I will continue to collect my small truths and piece them together until I can complete the final picture. Whether this takes months or even years, there is no need to rush science. She will show me what I seek when she deems it the right time to do so.${prompt};
And, who am I to disturb a loving couple the moment they find their happiness?${prompt};
Leave them be, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Nevertheless, these events prove that the truth is often stranger than fiction, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Pleasantries aside, the whole thing closely resembles the tale of “Poroggo and the Prince.” Why, the two are even planning a marriage, it seems.${prompt};
I believe I mentioned earlier that a good scientist does not mix science and fairy tales.${prompt};
Though I have learned much in the past few days, there is still little information on the Poroggo.${prompt};
After some of the amazing things we witnessed, it would be easy to attempt to tie those to superstition.${prompt};
However, this would only lead us farther from the truth.${prompt};
Ridding our mind of prejudice and predetermination, and approaching a problem with a clean slate is the only way to find what we seek.${prompt};
I believe this can be said for adventurers as well as scientists.${prompt};
${name-player}, it has been a pleasure working with you, and I hope that our paths cross again in the future.${prompt};
Ah, yes. And before I forget...${prompt};
Here is your reward.${prompt};
I hope it aids you on your travels.${prompt};
Farewell!;
Please wait a few moments and try inspecting the area again.${prompt};
You earn ${number: 1} zeni.${prompt};
You use up ${number: 1} zeni.${prompt};
That glimmer of determination in your eyes...${prompt};
The aura of confidence that can only be felt from one who has overcome unspeakable hardships...${prompt};
There is no mistake about it--you are an adventurer, and no ordinary one at that.${prompt};
How was it that I could tell, you ask? To one with a trained eye, such things are no different to distinguishing a mandragora from a morbol.${prompt};
I've been praying to the Goddess to be delivered one such as you. I beseech you, adventurer, spare me a moment of your time and hear my plea.${prompt};
Oh, you must excuse me. I've completely forgotten my manners. I am Sanraku, a simple traveling painter from the Far East.${prompt};
I have devoted my life entirely to capturing the beauty of nature on canvas. In pursuit of that which would make the perfect painting subject, I have traveled to the deepest hearts of continents and traversed tempestuous seas.${prompt};
Enticed by rumors of Aht Urhgan's diverse and unique fauna, I made my way here with my apprentice, Ryo. But nothing could have prepared us for the darkness that threatens to swallow up the whole Empire.${prompt};
Civilians like us dare not leave the city, lest we fall victim to the prowling hordes of beastmen. Even these mighty sandstone walls do little to stay the relentless besiegers.${prompt};
I had all but given up hope that any fruit would be borne of my journey to Aht Urhgan. In fact, we were about to pack up and leave on the next ship to Mhaura when you appeared. Surely, it was by the divine grace of the Goddess that you have been led here.${prompt};
Will you not lend us a hand, noble adventurer? The task I have in mind for you is straightforward, and I will make sure you are well compensated for your valuable assistance.${prompt};
Let me first provide you with some background information.${prompt};
Aht Urhgan is home to numerous technologically advanced inventions, among which the automaton is most famous. The invention that has caught my interest, however, is a lesser known contraption known as a “soultrapper”--truly a marvel of science. It has the ability to capture visual images onto objects called “soul plates.”${prompt};
I want you to venture out into the wilderness in my stead and seek out and capture images of Aht Urhgan's fauna, using the soultrapper.${prompt};
I would sooner be on location with paintbrush in hand, if it weren't for the hostile climate. This is why we are in dire need of your aid, adventurer. There is no one else we can rely on.${prompt};
If you have any specific questions, my lovely apprentice here will be delighted to help you.${prompt};
Our hopes rest upon your able shoulders, noble adventurer.${prompt};
Our hopes rest upon your able shoulders, noble adventurer.${prompt};
How may I serve you?${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Locating unique fauna.;
Gaining access to islets.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Is there nothing else?${prompt};
Speak to me again after you've reorganized your inventory.${prompt};
Oh, it seems you are already in possession of one.;
In that case, you will not be requiring another.${prompt};
I appreciate you bringing me more ${item-plural: 1[2]}. However, I'm afraid I can only accept up to ${number: 2} for each ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[day/days]. After all, we need to travel light.${prompt};
Of which creature would you like to know?${prompt};
Ask about which creature?;
${selection-lines};
Vulpangue.;
Chamrosh.;
Cheese Hoarder Gigiroon.;
Iriz Ima.;
Lividroot Amooshah.;
Iriri Samariri.;
Armed Gears.;
Gotoh Zha the Redolent.;
Dea.;
Tinnin.;
Brass Borer.;
Claret.;
Ob.;
Anantaboga.;
Reacton.;
Dextrose.;
Nosferatu.;
Khromasoul Bhurborlor.;
Achamoth.;
Sarameya.;
Velionis.;
Lil' Apkallu.;
Chigre.;
Wulgaru.;
Zareehkl the Jubilant.;
Verdelet.;
Mahjlaef the Paintorn.;
Experimental Lamia.;
Nuhn.;
Tyger.;
Pandemonium Warden.;
Don't ask.${prompt};
For information on that creature, a deduction of ${number: 6} zeni from your account should be adequate.${prompt};
Oh dear, I'm afraid you do not have enough zeni. I would dearly love to furnish you with the information, but rules are rules.${prompt};
For this piece of information I will need to receive your tally seal also.${prompt};
I will ask you once more: Are you positive that ${choice: 0}[Vulpangue/Chamrosh/Cheese Hoarder Gigiroon/Iriz Ima/Lividroot Amooshah/Iriri Samariri/Armed Gears/Gotoh Zha the Redolent/Dea/Tinnin/Brass Borer/Claret/Ob/Anantaboga/Reacton/Dextrose/Nosferatu/Khromasoul Bhurborlor/Achamoth/Sarameya/Velionis/Lil' Apkallu/Chigre/Wulgaru/Zareehkl the Jubilant/Verdelet/Mahjlaef the Paintorn/Experimental Lamia/Nuhn/Tyger/Pandemonium Warden] is the creature whose information you desire?${prompt};
Are you positive?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
Let me rethink...${prompt};
Then, I give you this lure item. With it, the creature you seek will surely be enticed into coming out of hiding.${prompt};
I recall a hunter friend well-versed in Aht Urhgan fauna telling me that this creature is native to ${choice: 0}[the Wajaom Woodlands/Bhaflau Thickets/Mount Zhayolm/Caedarva Mire/the Aydeewa Subterrane/Mamook/Halvung/Arrapago Reef/the Alzadaal Undersea Ruins].${prompt};
Your adventurer's instinct should reveal to you the suitable location to place the lure. I have every confidence that you will not fail to locate that which you seek.${prompt};
Then, I give you this key. You will need it to gain access to the Pandemonium Gate in order to arrange an encounter with the Pandemonium Warden.${prompt};
According to folklore, the gate appears somewhere within the Aydeewa Subterrane.${prompt};
Your adventurer's instinct should reveal to you the suitable location to use the key. I have every confidence that you will not fail to locate that which you seek.${prompt};
You wish to know how to gain access to islets?${prompt};
The islet for which area?;
${selection-lines};
Wajaom Woodlands.;
Mount Zhayolm.;
Caedarva Mire.;
Nothing.${prompt};
The islet in ${choice: 6}[the Wajaom Woodlands/Mount Zhayolm/Caedarva Mire], you say?${prompt};
Are you positive?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Hmmm...;
For information on how to gain access to that islet, a deduction of ${number: 6} zeni from your account should be sufficient.${prompt};
Aaah, my apologies, friend. While I burn to reveal this information to you, without sufficient zeni, I cannot oblige your request.${prompt};
Take this salt with you. At ${choice: 6}[Wajaom Woodlands/Mount Zhayolm/Caedarva Mire], you will find a most unusual stone tablet emitting a soft light from its engraving.${prompt};
Sprinkle the salt onto the tablet, and your journey to the islet will be over quicker than you can say “Pandemonium Warden”!${prompt};
There is one thing to keep in mind, however. Should you hear a tinkling sound like that of a bell even after sprinkling the salt, you cannot yet access the islet. You would be well advised to try again another time.${prompt};
Oh my, is that a soul plate you have brought for me?;
If I could be permitted to do the honors...${prompt};
Aaah...hmmm...${prompt};
Magnificent! Truly a triumph in photography!;
My faith in you is obviously well placed!${prompt};
A fine piece of photography!;
You have my thanks!${prompt};
Hmmm... Surely you can do better than this, my friend. But I will accept it nevertheless.${prompt};
Why, this is...! So you were successful in subduing the creature? You are indeed an adventurer worthy of admiration!${prompt};
Please accept this Far Eastern tally seal as a symbol of my faith in you.${prompt};
A single tally seal is proof positive of your prowess as an adventurer. You shan't be requiring another.${prompt};
Ah, please forgive me. My master, Sanraku, whom I respect and revere, has forbidden me from engaging in conversation, as it will disrupt my attunement with nature.${prompt};
Greetings, adventurer. My name is Ryo, apprentice to Master Sanraku. The master has instructed me to assist you in whatever way possible.${prompt};
Good day, ${name-player}. How may I be of service?${prompt};
What would you like to ask about?;
${selection-lines};
What's “zeni”?;
My zeni balance.;
Sanraku's subject of interest.;
Recommended fauna.;
The criteria for a good image.;
Far Eastern tally seals.;
Obtaining a soultrapper.;
Getting access to islets.;
Nothing.${prompt};
You currently have ${number: 0} zeni in your account.${prompt};
Ah yes, zeni... This may require some explaining. A keen eye and peerless attention to detail are attributes that made Master Sanraku the artistic genius that he is. The very same things, however, have also given him a somewhat calculating personality.${prompt};
Take zeni, the Far Eastern currency, for example. This is Master Sanraku's way of keeping track of your contribution to his objectives.${prompt};
Bringing him a soul plate image of fauna will earn you virtual zeni in your account. For your information, the account keeper is me.${prompt};
On the other hand, Master Sanraku will deduct zeni from your account as a fee for providing information on fauna.${prompt};
While I do not entirely agree to Master's cumbersome methodology, as a mere apprentice it is not my place to make comments.${prompt};
This goes without saying, but the subject must be well framed in the shot.${prompt};
And preferably, be of a creature in which Master is interested.${prompt};
However, like his inability to stay faithful to one woman, his subject of interest is also prone to change.${prompt};
One last thing. If you show me your soul plates before giving them to the master, I can give you an estimate on their worth in zeni.${prompt};
The pursuit of beauty in nature is often accompanied by unavoidable hazards. There are times when one has no choice but to slay an aggravated creature in self-defense.${prompt};
When you defeat such a creature, bring back evidence of your feat to show to Master Sanraku.${prompt};
From his numerous journeys across the globe, Master Sanraku has come to admire the courage and honor displayed by adventurers.${prompt};
If you can prove your triumph over a formidable foe, the master will be pleased and reward you with a tally seal from the Far East.${prompt};
Consider it a symbol of his faith in your ability. Please note, however, that it isn't just for show. There is nothing for which Master Sanraku does not have a purpose.${prompt};
In the Wajaom Woodlands, Mount Zhayolm, and Caedarva Mire, you will find strange stone tablets that emit a soft glow from their engravings. These objects are thought to be a legacy of a long lost ancient civilization.${prompt};
Legend says that sprinkling salt onto these tablets will teleport you to mystical islets.${prompt};
Being a skeptic at heart, Master Sanraku couldn't resist the temptation to put this legend to the test, which he verified as fact.${prompt};
Upon his return, he ranted on for weeks on end about the rare fauna he witnessed on these islets, like a young boy who had seen an airship for the first time.${prompt};
I recall Master Sanraku using some variety of sea salt.${prompt};
Unfortunately, I haven't yet had the privilege of seeing the islets with my own eyes.${prompt};
But Master Sanraku will undoubtedly be pleased to have the opportunity to tell someone about his experience.${prompt};
You can obtain a soultrapper by going to the Colosseum in the southeast area and speaking with a man named Zandjarl.${prompt};
Is there anything else with which I can assist?${prompt};
Please do not hesitate to ask me if there is anything you wish to know.${prompt};
You've brought me a soul plate for appraisal?${prompt};
Hmmm... Yes, I see...${prompt};
This sample should earn you approximately ${number: 0} zeni.${prompt};

Trading cinder.${prompt};
The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt};
Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.;
If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt};
You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.;
It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;
Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt};
With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!;
Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt};
The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.;
In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt};
But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt};
If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt};
Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.;
You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt};
Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt};
Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt};
Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.;
Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt};
You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt};
Here's the good news: you don't have to!;
For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt};
The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.;
At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt};
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt};
Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt};
Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.;
Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt};
Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.;
May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt};
First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.;
You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt};
You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.;
Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt};
Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.;
If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt};
You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;
Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt};
From here, it becomes a race against the clock!;
Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};
However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.;
Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt};
If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt};
You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.;
Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt};
The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.;
While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt};
This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.;
As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt};
As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.;
There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt};
For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.;
Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt};
You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt};
In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.;
To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt};
Now let us return to the synergy process itself.;
As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt};
If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.;
The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt};
Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!;
Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt};
What's an elemental surge, you ask?;
Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt};
The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt};
...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.;
There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt};
Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.;
We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt};
Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.;
There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt};
Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt};
The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.;
The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt};
In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt};
First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt};
The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.;
There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt};
If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt};
As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt};
You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.;
It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt};
Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.;
Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt};
My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.;
The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt};
The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt};
Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.;
Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt};
To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt};
When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt};
Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt};
Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!;
Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt};
As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”;
The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt};
Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt};
To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt};
For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt};
That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!;
What could be easier?${prompt};
Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?;
If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt};
Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.;
You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt};
Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.;
As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt};
Ah, synergy techniques!;
Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt};
My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.;
We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt};
Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.;
For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt};
Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.;
You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt};
Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.;
These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt};
The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.;
To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt};
Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt};
Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.;
Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt};
We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!;
Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt};
Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?;
Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt};
A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.;
Let's see here...${prompt};

I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt};
...Alas.;
It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt};
Hmm, what's this?;
It would seem that your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched at this time.${prompt};

What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt};
Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.;
The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt};
Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt};
Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt};
Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.;
The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt};
You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt};
But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt};
A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt};
That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.;
Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt};
An aspiring synergist, I see!;
If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt};
I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.;
A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt};
As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!;
How's that for a deal?${prompt};
The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.;
Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt};
Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt};
Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};
And that's all there is to it.;
This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!${prompt};

Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!${prompt};

Just wondering...${prompt};
You remember that little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis?;
I was just worried...ah, never mind.${prompt};
Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis?;
There's something that's been bothering me...${prompt};
The girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis...;
Have you seen her since then? I'm just a little worried, that's all.${prompt};
By the way, do you remember the young lady we saved in Eldieme Necropolis?;
Such a fragile little thing... I hope she's okay.${prompt};
I wonder how the little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis is doing.;
I was just thinking about it.${prompt};
So, have you seen the little girl we found crying in the Eldieme Necropolis lately?;

How is the young girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis doing?;

I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba.;
What was it even doing there? Does it have something to do with that mirror?${prompt};
Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba?;
What on Vana'diel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?${prompt};
About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba...;
Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?${prompt};
There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba.;
Why was it there, I wonder...${prompt};
Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba?;
It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.${prompt};
The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call.;
I'm sure glad I showed up when I did.${prompt};
Why was that dragon in Ghelsba?;
I hope it doesn't foreshadow something worse...${prompt};
I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba.;
Was it after the mirror, maybe?${prompt};
Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba?;
It's strange that such a creature would be found there...${prompt};
Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba?;
I mean, besides the one we fought...${prompt};
There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba.;
Why was it there, I wonder...${prompt};
The dragon we fought in Ghelsba does not belong there.;

Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt};
If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.;
I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt};
Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt};
Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.;
At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.${prompt};
A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out.;
I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt};
The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.;
No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt};
How embarrassing...;
I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt};
Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.;
Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt};
Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?;
What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt};
Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt};
That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--;
A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt};
Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt};
Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?;
No...?${prompt};
I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.;
Bastok is a weird place...${prompt};
I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.;
He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt};
How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?;
I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt};
I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt};
I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt};
I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt};
I've never eaten a treant bulb before.;
What do they taste like?${prompt};
Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?;
What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt};
I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.;
He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt};
The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt};
In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.;
I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt};
I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.;
You should be careful!${prompt};
Windurst truly is a magical nation.;
I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt};
Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.;
The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt};
Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?;
Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt};
Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt};
Windurst is famous for its hat shop.;
I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt};
The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.;
Are they not for sale?${prompt};
The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.;
I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt};
There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.;
What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?;
It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt};
Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.;
The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt};
A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt};
When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt};
I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.;
I have my license, though. Really.${prompt};
Hmm.;
I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt};
It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt};
Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt};
Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt};
The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt};
Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt};
I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.;
The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt};
Are moogles considered to be beastmen?;
Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt};
It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt};
The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt};
I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.;
Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt};
And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?;
Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt};
...;
Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.;
Not very interesting at all.${prompt};
Do you notice the change?;
I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt};
There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt};
The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.;
Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt};
The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!;
My best dress, ruined!${prompt};
But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.;
And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt};
I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt};
I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt};
Do you notice the change?;
I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt};
Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt};
No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt};
I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt};
I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt};
Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt};
I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt};
I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt};
Have you ever seen an aurora?;
It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt};
I never know what to wear on windy days.;
I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt};
I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.;
What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt};
The smilebringers really exist, you know!;
They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt};
Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt};
In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt};
I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.;
Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt};
For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.;
Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt};
Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?;
Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt};
You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt};
But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt};
Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt};
I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.;
You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt};
Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt};
Do they trade with people?;
I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt};
They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.;
You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt};
But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.;
After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt};
You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.;
I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt};
I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt};
There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.;
We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt};
It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.;
No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt};
I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt};
You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt};
You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt};
Do you eat out much?${prompt};
I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt};
What do you keep in your Mog House?;
Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt};
It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.;
No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt};
I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt};
I have a friend in the business, you see.;
I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt};
The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt};
Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.;
Why don't we train together?${prompt};
I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt};
To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt};
M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!;
It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt};
Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt};
Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.;
Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt};
I have as many as four different sets worked out...;
I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt};
It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?;
Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt};
I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt};
What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...${prompt};

So, which do you think would suit me?${prompt};
Fashionable equipment?;
Tell me what you think suits me!${prompt};
So, what do you think would suit me?${prompt};
I wonder what would suit me...${prompt};
Is there something that'll suit me?${prompt};
Ooh, you wanna coordinate my attire for me?${prompt};
I think I look good in most things, but give me your honest opinion on which would suit me best.${prompt};
Oh, so much to choose from!;
You pick for me!${prompt};
So, what do you think would suit me?${prompt};
Oh!;
Pick something that doesn't make me look fat!${prompt};
I wonder which of these would suit me...${prompt};
If you have an opinion, let's hear it.${prompt};

I'm not really sure.;
Body.;

None.${prompt};

Well, I guess this isn't too bad...${prompt};
Well, then.;
I'll see that I wear this from now on.${prompt};
This one? I think I like it!;
I'll wear it from now on.${prompt};
Heheh, I had a feeling you'd pick this one.;
I've got a pile of spares, so there's no need to worry!${prompt};
Oh? Not a bad choice.;
I'll wear this for a while, then.${prompt};
Oh!;
That's my wardrobe sorted for a while!${prompt};
If that's your choice, I'm happy to go with it for the time being.${prompt};
Nice!;
I'll wear this from now on.${prompt};
Well, then.;

Hm...;
Looks like your fashion sense is above average. I have no qualms about your selection.${prompt};
This...?${prompt};
Are you sure...?${prompt};

I see...${prompt};
Uh-huh...?${prompt};
This thing here...?${prompt};
I suppose fashion is not your game...${prompt};
This? Um...okay...${prompt};

Really?;
Kinda boring, but okay...${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
Hmph... Remind me not to ask your opinion again.${prompt};

That ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding, is that about combat styles?;
Can I take a look?${prompt};
Hey, is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding about combat styles?;
Can I take a look?${prompt};
Is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} about combat styles?;
Let me borrow it for a bit.${prompt};
Does that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance?;
Might I take a look?${prompt};
What's that? Hey, isn't that ${item-singular: 1[2]} about combat styles?;
Can I have a look?${prompt};
How did you come by an unusual item like that?;
Wait a minute. That ${item-singular: 1[2]}...isn't it about combat styles? Mind if I sneak a peek?${prompt};
Hm? Is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding about combat styles?;
Would you mind if I borrowed it?${prompt};
Hey, is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding about combat styles?;
Don't be a hog, hand it over!${prompt};
Would that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you're holding be about combat styles?;
Can I see it?${prompt};
Hey, is that ${item-singular: 1[2]} about combat styles?;
Lemme see! Lemme see!${prompt};
Does that ${item-singular: 1[2]} you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance?;
Might I take a look?${prompt};
Hm? How did you come to be in possession of that ${item-singular: 1[2]}? Go on, show it to me.${prompt};
Hmm, that made a lot of sense.;
Let me know if you find any more of these.${prompt};
That was pretty informative stuff.;
If you find any more manuals like that, let me know!${prompt};
Hmm. There's a lot more to combat than I thought.;
Let me know if you find any more manuals like that.${prompt};
A fascinating read.;
Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.${prompt};
Wow, so much I never knew...;
If you have any more of these, please show them to me!${prompt};
Nope, never seen this one before.;
Uh-huh... So you're supposed to do this, and then--ah, I got it! Be sure to let me know if you come across any others, okay?${prompt};
Well, that cleared up a few things for me.;
Let me know if you find any similar books.${prompt};
Wow!;Ouah!
I never knew there was still so much to learn!;
If you find any more of these, you know where to bring them!${prompt};
Hmm...interesting.;
I'd appreciate it if you brought me any more of these you happened to find.${prompt};
Hmm...;
I think I understood most of it.;
Let me know if you find any more of these, okay?${prompt};
A fascinating read.;
Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.${prompt};
This is remarkable content indeed...;
I never knew such a combat style existed. Should you obtain any other such texts, bring them to me without delay.${prompt};
Your adventuring fellow has learned a new combat style!${prompt};

I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;
I just hope that nothing terrible happens...${prompt};
I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror.;
I'm a little scared, to be perfectly honest...${prompt};
I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired.;
Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.${prompt};
So the fate of that mirror has fallen into our hands...;
First, we must seek the items Luto spoke of.${prompt};

Two mirrors...;
There's some secret we're missing here.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
All this talk of mystery is making me hungry...${prompt};
Glass of Blessed Radiance...;
What connection could it have to the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?${prompt};
“The Lost Looking Glass”...;
Now there's a book I should like to read.${prompt};
Two mirrors...;
Could there also be an opposing entity to the Glass of All-Seeing?${prompt};
Hmmm...;
I can't help but wonder if there's a reason for there being two mirrors.${prompt};

There are four remnants within the Ruins of Alzadaal: Zhayolm, Arrapago, Bhaflau, and Silver Sea.${prompt};
Some fat cats thought they collected all they could long ago and abandoned the rrremnants, but there's still lots more to salvage down there.${prompt};
Here's an example of what you can dig up in the rrruins. I'd been searrrching all over the realm for it!${prompt};
I like your face, ${choice-player-gender}[loverboy/pretty girl], so I'll let you in on a little secret.;
People have found certain pieces of equipment that rrresonate with these artifacts. If you find any, show them to me and I'll sweeten your kitty.${prompt};
Oh...but let's keep this a secrrret from Ghanraam, shall we? Otherwise I'll tear your throat out and leave it on my master's doorstep!${prompt};

I knew you'd bring me a lot of these arrrtifacts, but this is ridiculous! There's not a whisker of room left to store them!${prompt};
My, my, my, look what the cat dragged in. I'd be happy to rrreconstruct this for you...under one condition.${prompt};
I prrromise I won't leave any marks...so what do you say?${prompt};

Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm! ${wait-36: 1};

Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?${prompt};
Oh yeah, 'fore I forget.;
What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.${prompt};
Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...${prompt};
Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes.;
Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more.;
Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.${prompt};
Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer “daily tally.”;

Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase!;
Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?${prompt};
And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy!;
But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.${prompt};
Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it.;
Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.${prompt};
Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble.;
It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.${prompt};
Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in.;
Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.${prompt};

I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!${prompt};
Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?${prompt};
Dese're some “special dials,” an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!${prompt};
Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese “special dials”? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.${prompt};
So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.${prompt};
'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.${prompt};
Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?${prompt};
