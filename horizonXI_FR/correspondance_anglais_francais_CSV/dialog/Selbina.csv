Very well. Selbina was established by Bastok as a haven for ships bearing Gustaberg ore. She soon grew into a thriving port town. ${prompt};C'est assez.${prompt}
Selbina declared neutrality at the outbreak of the Great War and maintains her independence to this day.${prompt};Très bien. Selbina a été créée par Bastok comme refuge pour les navires transportant le minerai de Gustaberg. Elle est rapidement devenue une ville portuaire prospère.
Very well. Our fair town lies in the middle of Valkurm Dunes, here in central Quon.${prompt};Selbina déclare sa neutralité lors du déclenchement de la Grande Guerre et maintient son indépendance jusqu’à ce jour.${prompt}
Most of the coastline consists of dunes and shallows. Selbina stands atop the only suitable harbor.${prompt};Très bien. Notre ville équitable se trouve au milieu des dunes de Valkurm, ici dans le centre de Quon.${prompt}
Very well. Thanks to the harbor, industry in Selbina has prospered throughout the ages.${prompt};La majeure partie du littoral est constituée de dunes et de bas-fonds. Selbina se trouve au sommet du seul port approprié.${prompt}
But airships are the wave of the future, so we are trying to develop local industries such as fishing and agriculture.${prompt};Très bien. Grâce au port, l’industrie de Selbina a prospéré à travers les âges.${prompt}
Very well. Here we have regional salesrooms of the Fishermen's and Weavers' Guilds, as well as an inn and the sea travel agency.${prompt};Mais les dirigeables sont la vague de l'avenir, c’est pourquoi nous essayons de développer des industries locales telles que la pêche et l’agriculture.${prompt}
You can purchase weapons from Torapiont inside the inn, and local items from Dohdjuma in front of the warehouse.${prompt};Très bien. Nous disposons ici des salles de vente régionales des guildes des pêcheurs et des tisserands, ainsi que d’une auberge et de l’agence de voyages maritimes.${prompt}
Please come back if you have any questions. Good day.${prompt};Vous pouvez acheter des armes auprès de Torapiont à l’intérieur de l’auberge et des objets locaux auprès de Dohdjuma devant l’entrepôt.${prompt}
Another adventurer in Selbina? I don't know where you come from, but you must be quite resourceful to make it this far out.${prompt};N’hésitez pas à revenir si vous avez des questions. Bonne journée.${prompt}
These days, folks like you spend every hard-earned gil on shiny new weapons and armor.${prompt};Un autre aventurier à Selbina ? Je ne sais pas d’où vous venez, mais vous devez faire preuve d’une grande ingéniosité pour arriver aussi loin.${prompt}
And then they just toss out their old onion-gear as if it were rubbish!${prompt};De nos jours, des gens comme vous dépensent chaque gil durement gagné en nouvelles armes et armures brillantes.${prompt}
Why, my father always scolded me whenever I left trash about! Indeed, a true adventurer would not litter, and neither should you!${prompt};Et puis ils jettent leur vieux matériel à oignons comme si c’était de la poubelle !${prompt}
That's why I thought of a plan: I'd gather old, worn-out onion equipment and recycle them.${prompt};Eh bien, mon père me grondait toujours à chaque fois que je laissais des déchets ! En effet, un véritable aventurier ne jetterait pas de déchets, et vous non plus ne devriez pas le faire !${prompt}
That's where you come in! Bring me five pieces of onion equipment, and I'll reward you for your efforts.${prompt};C’est pourquoi j’ai pensé à un plan : je rassemblerais le vieux matériel d’oignon usé et je le recyclerais.${prompt}
Yes, these will do nicely! Take this as a token of my thanks.${prompt};C’est là que vous entrez en jeu ! Apportez-moi cinq pièces d’équipement d’oignon et je vous récompenserai pour vos efforts.${prompt}
Remember, never just throw anything away. There is always a use for things!${prompt};Oui, ça fera très bien l’affaire ! Considérez ceci comme un gage de mes remerciements.${prompt}
Now, once I get these little onions mended and polished, I'll send them off for sale abroad. I'm sure new recruits will find them useful.${prompt};N’oubliez pas de ne jamais rien jeter. Il y a toujours une utilité aux choses !${prompt}
Oh, sorry... I was lost in thought.${prompt};Maintenant, une fois que j’aurai réparé et poli ces petits oignons, je les enverrai en vente à l’étranger. Je suis sûr que les nouvelles recrues les trouveront utiles.${prompt}
As you've no doubt discovered, this here village owes its life to the fish. Bless their hearts...${prompt};Oh, désolé... J’étais perdu dans mes pensées.${prompt}
Say, did you hear? Oswald, that traveling merchant... He said he lost a ring out in the harbor some time ago.${prompt};Comme vous l’avez sans doute découvert, ce village doit sa vie aux poissons. Bénis leurs cœurs...${prompt}
Of course I've heard the news. He said it was so precious to him, his face turned blue!${prompt};Dis, vous avez entendu ? Oswald, ce marchand ambulant... Il a dit avoir perdu une bague dans le port il y a quelque temps.${prompt}
Yes...poor chap! It must be at the bottom of the sea by now. I feel awful for him, but he'll never see it again.${prompt};Bien sûr, j’ai entendu la nouvelle. Il a dit que c’était si précieux pour lui que son visage est devenu bleu !${prompt}
Don't mind me. I have a lot to think about and... Huh? Oh, you've heard about my ring, have you?${prompt};Oui...pauvre type ! Il doit être au fond de la mer maintenant. Je me sens mal pour lui, mais il ne le reverra plus jamais.${prompt}
I dropped it near the pier and it just... It was so dear to me. I don't know what to do.${prompt};Ne faites pas attention à moi. J’ai beaucoup de choses à penser et... Hein ? Oh, vous avez entendu parler de ma bague, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I'd give anything to get my ring back. Anything! But the ocean has swallowed it forever. It's lost.${prompt};Je l’ai déposé près de la jetée et c’est juste... Il m'était si cher. Je ne sais pas quoi faire.${prompt}
What!? You want me to look for a ring? Oh, my! You ask the impossible.${prompt};Je donnerais n’importe quoi pour récupérer ma bague. Rien! Mais l’océan l’a englouti pour toujours. C’est perdu.${prompt}
Oswald's ring, eh? I'd sure like to help him out, but there's no way I could find a ring on the bottom of the sea.${prompt};Quoi !? Vous voulez que je cherche une bague ? Oh mon! Vous demandez l’impossible.${prompt}
Wait! Maybe Zaldon knows something. That old angler's the most knowledgeable man in this here whole village.${prompt};La bague d’Oswald, hein ? J’aimerais bien l’aider, mais je ne peux pas trouver une bague au fond de la mer.${prompt}
What? You're out to find that ring? That's like finding a needle in a haystack!${prompt};Attendez ! Peut-être que Zaldon sait quelque chose. Ce vieux pêcheur est l’homme le plus compétent de tout ce village.${prompt}
Hmm... Of course, it's not impossible. But I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.${prompt};Quoi ? Vous cherchez cette bague ? C’est comme chercher une aiguille dans une botte de foin !${prompt}
Listen. Around here, the ${item-plural: 0[2]} often bite. Heck, they'll swallow anything that sparkles.${prompt};Hmm... Bien sûr, ce n’est pas impossible. Mais je ne placerais pas mes espoirs trop haut.${prompt}
There's a chance that one of them gulped the ring down. So, catch as many ${item-plural: 0[2]} as you can, and you just might find it!${prompt};Écoutez. Par ici, le ${item-plural: 0[2]} mord souvent. Bon sang, ils avaleront tout ce qui brille.${prompt}
There's no guarantee you'll get it, but what have you got to lose? It beats scouring the bottom of the sea, doesn't it?${prompt};Il’ y a une chance que l’un d’eux ait avalé l’anneau. Alors, attrapez autant de ${item-plural: 0[2]} que possible, et vous pourriez bien le trouver !${prompt}
Once you catch ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, bring it. I'll cut it open for you.${prompt};Il n’y a aucune garantie que vous l’obtiendrez, mais qu’avez-vous à perdre ? C’est mieux que de parcourir le fond de la mer, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Caught one, did you? Well, give me a second here. I'll cut it right open.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez attrapé ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, apportez-le. Je vais l’ouvrir pour vous.${prompt}
Oh, too bad. No ring in this here fish. You must catch more.${prompt};Vous en avez attrapé un, n’est-ce pas ? Eh bien, donnez-moi une seconde ici. Je vais l’ouvrir tout de suite.${prompt}
Well, tug my tail! I never thought you'd find it, but here it is!${prompt};Oh, dommage. Pas de bague dans ce poisson ici. Vous devez en attraper davantage.${prompt}
Here you go! That's some fine fishermanship, I must say! Make sure that fool Oswald never drops it again!${prompt};Eh bien, tirez-moi la queue ! Je n’aurais jamais pensé que vous le trouveriez, mais le voici !${prompt}
Yes, what is this? Goodness gracious! My ring! You found my precious ring! Thank you! Thank you so much!${prompt};Et voilà ! C'est du bon savoir-faire de pêche, je dois dire ! Assurez-vous que cet imbécile d’Oswald ne le laisse plus jamais tomber !${prompt}
You see, this is an engagement ring. My love dwells in Mhaura, and someday I shall offer this to her.${prompt};Oui, qu’est-ce que c’est ? Bon Dieu ! Ma bague! Vous avez trouvé ma précieuse bague ! Merci! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
"How could I forget my promise? This is but a mere token of my thanks, but take it; you've more than earned it!${prompt}";Vous voyez, c’est une bague de fiançailles. Mon amour habite à Mhaura, et un jour je lui offrirai ceci.${prompt}
Hallo there. Whit dae ye think of ma sheep? Ah uised tae chaise doon wild yins fer their wuil, but nou ah've got sheep of ma ain!${prompt};"Comment pourrais-je oublier ma promesse ? Ceci n’est qu’un simple témoignage de mes remerciements, mais prenez-le ; vous l’avez plus que mérité !${prompt}"

Ma family minds the shop fer me, sae ah can stay oot here an watch ower ma sheep.${prompt};C’est pourquoi un masel de mouton aux raisins secs !${prompt}
But gettin quality wuil is awfie haird!${prompt};Ma famille s’occupe du magasin pour moi, donc elle peut rester ici pour surveiller mes moutons.${prompt}
Sae ah'm ettlin tae stuff them wi the verra best feed!${prompt};Mais obtenir une qualité de vie, c’est horrible !${prompt}
Tha's why ah need yer help, ${choice-player-gender}[laddie/lass]. Would ye mind fetchin me some feed fer ma sheep?${prompt};Je vais les farcir avec le meilleur flux !${prompt}
Well?;C’est pourquoi j’ai besoin de ton aide, ${choice-player-gender}[laddie/lass]. Cela vous dérangerait-il de me rapporter de la nourriture pour mes moutons ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Bien?
Of course.;
Sorry, but I can't.${prompt};Bien sûr.
Ye will? Tha's a ${choice-player-gender}[braw lad/good lass]! Ah'm needin many different sorts of them, an some mair than ithers. Listen cannily!${prompt};Désolé, mais je ne peux pas.${prompt}

Alsae, ah could uise three ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt};Ah j’en ai besoin de cinq ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Lastly, ah could uise jist one ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Mind an caw cannie!${prompt};Aussi, ah pourrait en utiliser trois ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Braw wirk, ${choice-player-gender}[lad/lassie]. Ye've brought me these ${item-plural: 1[2]}, have ye? Here, take this wi ma thanks!${prompt};Enfin, j’en utiliserais un seul ${item-singular: 2[2]}. Attention à un chien croassant !${prompt}
Ma sheep are aye in need of quality feed. Anytime ye find some, bring it ower, an ah'll take it right awa.${prompt};Braw wirk, ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille]. Vous m’avez apporté ça ${item-plural: 1[2]}, l’avez-vous ? Tiens, prends ça avec ma mère, merci!${prompt}
Och, ye forgot whit sortay feed ah'm needin, did ye? Well, here it is agane, sae listen cannily!${prompt};Mes moutons ont toujours besoin d’une alimentation de qualité. Chaque fois que vous en trouvez, apportez-en de la fleur, et je la prendrai tout de suite.${prompt}

I'm Abelard, mayor of this village. It's so tiny, you see, that all I do is mediate when there are disagreements.${prompt};L’ivver de Naebody m’a dit non ! Vous avez du sang-froid sur vos bras, n’est-ce pas ? Revenez bientôt à tout moment. Ah, je serai là.${prompt}
In my spare time I research the life of Gwynham, the man who charted the maps we all carry today.${prompt};Je m’appelle Abélard, maire de ce village. C’est si petit, voyez-vous, que je ne fais que servir de médiateur en cas de désaccord.${prompt}
He was an adventurer, like you. His travels took him far and wide, and slowly he fleshed out his maps.${prompt};Pendant mon temps libre, je fais des recherches sur la vie de Gwynham, l’homme qui a tracé les cartes que nous portons tous aujourd'hui.${prompt}
One day I discovered that stone monuments bearing his words lie in various places all over the world.${prompt};C’était un aventurier, comme vous. Ses voyages l’ont emmené très loin et, lentement, il a étoffé ses cartes.${prompt}
It seems each monument carries a different quote. I'd love to rush out there and see them all, but it's tough at my age.${prompt};Un jour, j’ai découvert que des monuments en pierre portant ses paroles se trouvent à divers endroits dans le monde.${prompt}
Say, maybe you could help me gather his words! Well, what do you say?${prompt};Il semble que chaque monument porte une citation différente. J’adorerais me précipiter et les voir tous, mais c’est difficile à mon âge.${prompt}
What a relief! Well, there's no time to lose! Let's get you started on one close by.${prompt};Dis, vous pourrez peut-être m’aider à rassembler ses mots ! Eh bien, qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
Take this clay to the monument in West Ronfaure, and press it firmly upon the inscription. Then, bring it back so I can print a copy for my collection.${prompt};Quel soulagement! Eh bien, il n’y a pas de temps à perdre ! Commençons par un projet à proximité.${prompt}
Nobody seems to know exactly where to find the monument, so I suppose it might be difficult to find. Take care!${prompt};Apportez cette argile au monument de Ronfaure Ouest, et pressez-la fermement sur l’inscription. Ensuite, rapportez-le afin que je puisse en imprimer une copie pour ma collection.${prompt}
Is that right? Well, that's too bad. Come back if you ever have a change of heart.${prompt};Personne ne semble savoir exactement où trouver le monument, donc je suppose qu’il pourrait être difficile à trouver. Faites attention !${prompt}
At last! You've done it! You have my warmest thanks. Here, this is a reward for your effort. Don't expect too much from this old man, though, hehe.${prompt};Est-ce vrai ? Eh bien, c’est dommage. Revenez si jamais vous changez d’avis.${prompt}
Ah, you're back! This isn't the one I asked for, but beggars can't be choosers! Here, it's not much, but take this.${prompt};Enfin ! Vous l’avez fait ! Je vous remercie chaleureusement. Ici, c’est une récompense pour vos efforts. Mais n’attendez pas grand-chose de ce vieil homme, hehe.${prompt}
Well? Do you want to bring back another one for me? ${prompt};Ah, vous êtes de retour ! Ce n’est pas celui que j’ai demandé, mais les mendiants ne peuvent pas choisir ! Ici, ce n’est pas grand-chose, mais prenez ça.${prompt}
Actually, I don't know where the others are. You'll have to find them and make the impressions yourself. Good luck, and take care!${prompt};Eh bien ? Voulez-vous m’en rapporter un autre ?
Hello again! How's it going? Got the guts to go out and search for monuments yet? Sometimes they're a cakewalk, you know. What do you say?${prompt};En fait, je ne sais pas où sont les autres. Vous devrez les trouver et faire les impressions vous-même. Bonne chance et prenez soin de vous !${prompt}
What? How could you lose a big piece of clay!? Here, I'll give you another one. Now, take care!${prompt};Re-bonjour ! Comment ça va? Avez-vous déjà eu le courage de partir à la recherche de monuments ? Parfois, c’est du gâteau, vous savez. Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
Oh, I'm sorry, my friend, but I've already got this one, so try getting me a different one. Take care, now.${prompt};Quoi ? Comment avez-vous pu perdre un gros morceau d’argile !? Tenez, je vais vous en donner un autre. Maintenant, faites attention !${prompt}
You don't know where to go next, eh? Well, I still don't have an impression from the monument in ${choice: 0}[West Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/La Theine/Valkurm/Jugner Forest/Batallia/North Gustaberg/South Gustaberg/Konschtat], you know.${prompt};Oh, je suis désolé, mon ami, mais j’ai déjà celui-ci, alors essayez de m’en procurer un autre. Faites attention, maintenant.${prompt}
You don't know where to go next, eh? Well, I still don't have an impression from the monument in ${choice: 0}[Pashhow/Rolanberry/West Sarutabaruta/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Buburimu/Meriphataud/Sauromugue], you know.${prompt};Vous ne savez pas où aller ensuite, hein ? Eh bien, je n’ai toujours pas d’impression du monument de ${choice: 0}[West Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/La Theine/Valkurm/Jugner Forest/Batallia/North Gustaberg/South Gustaberg/Konschtat], vous savez.${prompt}
You're back! And with the last one! Thank you so much, my friend. In return for your unwavering kindness, I give you this.${prompt};Vous ne savez pas où aller ensuite, hein ? Eh bien, je n’ai toujours pas d’impression du monument de ${choice: 0}[Pashhow/Rolanberry/West Sarutabaruta/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Buburimu/Meriphataud/Sauromugue],vous savez.${prompt}
Well, it's good to see you again! My research is going quite well, thanks to you. I hope that map's been useful.${prompt};Vous êtes de retour! Et avec le dernier ! Merci beaucoup mon ami. En échange de votre gentillesse inébranlable, je vous offre ceci.${prompt}
Yeah? Who the heck are you? If you wanna be somebody, get some more experience under your belt!${prompt};Eh bien, ça fait du bien de vous revoir ! Mes recherches avancent plutôt bien, grâce à vous. J’espère que cette carte a été utile.${prompt}
We work the docks, loading the ships with cargo. You know, ships can't sail without food and water, but they take up precious cargo space.${prompt};Ouais ? Qui diable êtes-vous? Si vous voulez devenir quelqu’un, acquérez plus d’expérience à votre actif !${prompt}
So, long ago one sea dog had an idea. He figured that ${item-plural: 0[2]} are loaded with water and nutrition. He could kill two birds with one stone.${prompt};Nous travaillons sur les quais et chargeons les navires de marchandises. Vous savez, les navires ne peuvent pas naviguer sans nourriture ni eau, mais ils occupent un espace de chargement précieux.${prompt}
The thing was, regular ${item-plural: 0[2]} didn't work! He needed the ones crawlers like to hoard in their nests. The more aged, the better!${prompt};Il y a bien longtemps, un chien de mer a eu une idée. Il pensait que ${item-plural: 0[2]} sont chargés d’eau et de nutrition. Il pourrait faire d’une pierre deux coups.${prompt}
If you ever get your hands on some ${item-plural: 0[2]}, bring them on back to me here. And the older they are, the more I'll pay!${prompt};Le truc, c’était régulier ${item-plural: 0[2]} ça n’a pas marché ! Il avait besoin de ceux que les chenilles aiment accumuler dans leurs nids. Plus c’est vieux, mieux c’est !${prompt}
"Hey, thanks a lot. Bring me all you find; there's more gil where that came from!${prompt}";Si jamais vous mettez la main sur ${item-plural: 0[2]}, rapportez-les-moi ici. Et plus ils sont vieux, plus je paierai cher !${prompt}
I'm a little short on gil at the moment.;"Hé, merci beaucoup. Apportez-moi tout ce que vous trouvez ; il y a plus de Gil d’où ça vient!${prompt}"
I'll buy your ${item-plural: 0[2]} once my wages come in...${prompt};Je suis un peu à court de Gil en ce moment.
Hello, how have you been? Haven't seen you for some time.${prompt};Je vais acheter votre ${item-plural: 0[2]} une fois mon salaire arrivé...${prompt}
Me? Yes, I'm doing fine, thanks. But my girlfriend's just not feeling well at all.${prompt};Bonjour, comment vas-tu ? Je ne vous ai pas vu depuis un certain temps.${prompt}
I don't think she's sick, so I'm just having her eat nutritious things and hoping she starts feeling better soon.${prompt};Moi ? Oui, je vais bien, merci. Mais ma copine ne se sent tout simplement pas bien.${prompt}
I asked the cook at the inn for some help. He said he'd need some special ingredients, but there's no way I could get them!${prompt};Je ne pense pas qu’elle soit malade, alors je lui fais simplement manger des choses nutritives et j’espère qu’elle commencera à se sentir mieux bientôt.${prompt}
You helped me out so much before, so maybe you could do just one more favor for me.${prompt};J’ai demandé de l’aide au cuisinier de l’auberge. Il a dit qu’il aurait besoin d’ingrédients spéciaux, mais je ne pourrais pas les obtenir !${prompt}
Thank you very much. He wanted ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Vous m’avez tellement aidé auparavant, alors peut-être pourriez-vous me rendre un service supplémentaire.${prompt}
They say they're really hard to come by. Take care, and best of luck to you.${prompt};Merci beaucoup. Il voulait ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Is that a fact? I wonder who could have the time to help me...${prompt};Ils disent qu’ils sont vraiment difficiles à trouver. Prenez soin de vous et bonne chance à vous.${prompt}
Say, this is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}! You found it. You really found it! Thank you so much! Now he can start on that dish!${prompt};Est-ce un fait ? Je me demande qui pourrait avoir le temps de m’aider...${prompt}
This is all I have to give. Please, take it. You're our savior!${prompt};Dites, c’est ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}! Vous l’avez trouvé. Vous l’avez vraiment trouvé ! Merci beaucoup! Maintenant, il peut commencer avec ce plat !${prompt}
Oh, hello there. Thanks for helping me out then. My girlfriend was very grateful.${prompt};C’est tout ce que j’ai à donner. Prenez le s’il vous plait. Vous êtes notre sauveur !${prompt}
But she still isn't back to her old self. So, I started thinking some more...${prompt};Oh, bonjour. Merci de m’avoir aidé alors. Ma copine était très reconnaissante.${prompt}
I thought that maybe the real culprit is food itself! Once you eat something, it's gone, right?${prompt};Mais elle n’est toujours pas revenue à son ancien moi. Alors, j’ai commencé à réfléchir davantage...${prompt}
And that's when I came up with this great idea for my next present...but I'll need a little help getting it. ${prompt};Je pensais que le vrai coupable était peut-être la nourriture elle-même ! Une fois que vous avez mangé quelque chose, il est parti, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Well, what do you say? Could I call upon you for yet another favor?${prompt};Et c'est à ce moment-là que j’ai eu cette excellente idée pour mon prochain cadeau... mais j’aurai besoin d’un peu d'aide pour l’obtenir.
Oh, I see. But I really would prefer you! If you ever find the time to help me, please come back.${prompt};Eh bien, qu’en dites-vous ? Puis-je faire appel à vous pour une autre faveur ?${prompt}
I know I might seem stubborn, but you're my only hope.${prompt};Oh, je vois. Mais je vous préférerai vraiment ! Si jamais vous trouvez le temps de m’aider, revenez s’il vous plaît.${prompt}
I heard about how you found the ring. You caught so many fish, and finally you found it inside one of them, right?${prompt};Je sais que je peux paraître têtu, mais vous êtes mon seul espoir.${prompt}
Well, since you're such a fine fisherman, I wanted to ask you to find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me.${prompt};J’ai entendu dire comment vous avez trouvé la bague. Vous avez attrapé tellement de poissons et finalement vous l’avez trouvé à l'intérieur de l’un d'eux, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
They say that ${item-plural: 0[2]} yield pearls. If I find one, I'm planning on having a boneworker fix it up for me.${prompt};Eh bien, puisque vous êtes un si bon pêcheur, je voulais vous demander de trouver ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} pour moi.${prompt}
Then I could give my girlfriend a fine pearl necklace. Well, don't you think she'd like it?${prompt};Ils disent ça ${item-plural: 0[2]} donner des perles. Si j’en trouve un, j’ai l’intention de demander à un menuisier de me le réparer..${prompt}
But without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, I can't even begin. I wish I knew where they could be caught. If I knew someone who could tell me.${prompt};Je pourrais alors offrir à ma copine un joli collier de perles. Eh bien, vous ne pensez pas qu’elle aimerait ça ?${prompt}
I have a feeling you'll figure something out. Please, do what you can.${prompt};Mais sans ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, Je ne peux même pas commencer. J’aurais aimé savoir où ils pourraient être attrapés. Si je connaissais quelqu’un qui pourrait me le dire.${prompt}
Now what? You're looking for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Don't you have anything better to do?${prompt};J’ai le sentiment que vous trouverez quelque chose. S’il vous plaît, faites ce que vous pouvez.${prompt}
I hear you can find ${item-plural: 0[2]} in sandy places like Valkurm and Buburimu. Heck, get a chocobo to dig some up on the coast.${prompt};J’ai le sentiment que vous trouverez quelque chose. S’il vous plaît, faites ce que vous pouvez. ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}? Vous n’avez rien de mieux à faire ?${prompt}
Lemme guess. You want to get some pearls from the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, right? Well, it takes time, but it's a lot cheaper than buying them.${prompt};J’ai entendu dire que vous pouvez trouver ${item-plural: 0[2]} dans des endroits sablonneux comme Valkurm et Buburimu. Bon sang, demandez à un chocobo d’en déterrer sur la côte.${prompt}
Goodness, you found one! Thank you so much! Here, this is for you.${prompt};Laisse-moi deviner. Vous voulez récupérer des perles du ${item-plural: 0[2]}, Pas vrai? Eh bien, cela prend du temps, mais c’est beaucoup moins cher que de les acheter.${prompt}
You're so fantastic! My girlfriend and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.${prompt};Bon sang, vous en avez trouvé un ! Merci beaucoup! Voilà, c’est pour vous.${prompt}
Oh, hello again. Thanks for all you've done. My girlfriend was quite impressed with the necklace! The thing is, she said something rather odd.${prompt};Vous êtes tellement fantastique ! Ma copine et moi vous remercions du fond du cœur.${prompt}
She said, “Thanks for the gift, but what I want the most is you here next to me.”${prompt};Oh, encore bonjour. Merci pour tout ce que vous avez fait. Ma copine a été très impressionnée par le collier ! Le problème, c’est qu’elle a dit quelque chose d’assez étrange.${prompt}
I didn't know what to say. Nobody's ever said such things to me!${prompt};"Elle a dit : ""Merci pour le cadeau, mais ce que je veux le plus, c’est toi ici à côté de moi.""${prompt}"
Thanks to you, I feel like I've learned what's really important.${prompt};Je ne savais pas quoi dire. Personne ne m’a jamais dit de telles choses !${prompt}
Now I know that she's the one. Thank you so much for all the help!${prompt};Grâce à vous, j’ai l’impression d’avoir appris ce qui est vraiment important.${prompt}
Oh, hello again. I can't believe I ever lost that ring. I won't let that happen again.${prompt};Maintenant, je sais que c’est elle. Merci beaucoup pour toute votre aide !${prompt}
These days we traveling merchants fight for our survival. But we can't just give up our livelihood. After all, things weren't always like this.${prompt};Oh, encore bonjour. Je ne peux pas croire que j’ai perdu cette bague. Je ne laisserai pas cela se reproduire.${prompt}
I've been all over Vana'diel, but the inn here is my favorite. It's not the most luxurious place in the world, but I love the relaxed atmosphere.${prompt};De nos jours, nous, marchands ambulants, nous battons pour notre survie. Mais nous ne pouvons pas simplement renoncer à nos moyens de subsistance. Après tout, les choses n’ont pas toujours été comme ça.${prompt}
I hear about you a lot. People say you do much for Selbina.${prompt};J’ai parcouru Vana’diel, mais l’auberge ici est ma préférée. Ce n’est pas l’endroit le plus luxueux au monde, mais j’adore l’atmosphère détendue.${prompt}
I speak for the whole town when I say thank you. Thank you.${prompt};J’entends beaucoup parler de vous. Les gens disent que vous faites beaucoup pour Selbina.${prompt}
Thing is, the turtlebacks are on the move. Word is they're up to no good.${prompt};Je parle au nom de toute la ville quand je dis merci. Merci.
I'm itching to go smash them, but I can't leave the town defenseless.${prompt};Le fait est que les tortues sont en mouvement. On dit qu’ils ne préparent rien de bon.${prompt}
Maybe you could go instead. What do you say?${prompt};J’ai hâte d’aller les écraser, mais je ne peux pas laisser la ville sans défense.${prompt}
Thanks. The turtlebacks often strike merchants headed to our village. Another caravan was attacked just the other day.${prompt};Peut-être que vous pourriez y aller à la place. Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
They fled, but two of them were taken prisoner.${prompt};Merci. Les tortues frappent souvent les marchands se dirigeant vers notre village. Une autre caravane a été attaquée l’autre jour.${prompt}
The turtlebacks prowling outside came from Beadeaux. We think the merchants are held captive there.${prompt};Ils ont pris la fuite, mais deux d’entre eux ont été faits prisonniers.${prompt}
Their names are Evrard and Serafin.${prompt};Les tortues qui rôdaient dehors venaient des Beadeaux. Nous pensons que les marchands y sont retenus captifs.${prompt}
They say that the turtlebacks keep prisoners locked up tight. Somewhere in Beadeaux there should be such a place.${prompt};Leurs noms sont Evrard et Serafin.${prompt}
The merchants who made it here said that they were different from other turtlebacks. I hope that helps.${prompt};On dit que les tortues maintiennent les prisonniers enfermés hermétiquement. Quelque part à Beadeaux, il devrait y avoir un tel endroit.${prompt}
I hate asking others to do our job, but please, rescue the two captives. Their families need them.${prompt};Les marchands qui l’ont fabriqué ici ont dit qu’ils étaient différents des autres tortues. J’espère que cela vous aidera.${prompt}
Oh? Pity... I hoped you would say yes.${prompt};Je déteste demander aux autres de faire notre travail, mais s’il vous plaît, sauvez les deux captifs. Leurs familles en ont besoin.${prompt}
W-we're saved! I thought they were going to kill us! Thank you! ${prompt};Ah ? Dommage... J’espérais que vous direz oui.${prompt}
Please, take our things back to Selbina for us. We can run well enough on our own.${prompt};N-nous sommes sauvés ! Je pensais qu’ils allaient nous tuer ! Merci!
We're so glad you came. As long as you carry our packs for us, we can watch the enemy as we make our way to safety.${prompt};S’il vous plaît, rapportez nos affaires à Selbina pour nous. Nous pouvons assez bien courir seuls.${prompt}
Once back in Selbina, give our packs to Thunder Hawk. He'll make sure we get them. Thank you, brave one!${prompt};Nous sommes si heureux que vous soyez venu. Tant que vous portez nos sacs pour nous, nous pouvons surveiller l’ennemi pendant que nous nous dirigeons vers la sécurité.${prompt}
Ah, perfect! We just arrived as well.${prompt};Une fois de retour à Selbina, donnez nos packs à Thunder Hawk. Il veillera à ce que nous les obtenions. Merci, courageux !${prompt}
Whew, I'm so glad we're free! We owe our lives to you!${prompt};Ah, parfait ! Nous venons d’arriver également.${prompt}
We're thankful enough you're safe. We apologize we couldn't help you.${prompt};Ouf, je suis tellement contente que nous soyons libres ! Nous vous devons la vie !${prompt}
But you did well. Thank you! This is for your service.${prompt};Nous sommes assez reconnaissants que vous soyez en sécurité. Nous nous excusons de ne pas pouvoir vous aider.${prompt}
You saved our lives, friend! Let us thank you as well. Here, take this!${prompt};Mais vous avez bien fait. Merci! Ceci est pour votre service.${prompt}
Oh, it's you again. There is nothing more I can teach you. Now go, and may Altana smile upon you.${prompt};Vous nous avez sauvé la vie, mon ami ! Laissez-nous vous remercier également. Tiens, prenez ça !${prompt}
What? Oh... Hello, child. I'm just a feeble old man. Go and leave me be.${prompt};Oh, c'est encore toi. Je ne peux rien vous apprendre de plus. Maintenant, partez, et qu'Altana vous sourie.${prompt}
So, little ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl], you want to be an adventurer, do you? Well, you've got a long way to go, I reckon.${prompt};Quoi ? Oh... Bonjour, mon enfant. Je ne suis qu’un vieil homme faible. Allez et laissez-moi tranquille.${prompt}
I am glad that you seek my wisdom, child, but still you are too callow.${prompt};Si petit ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille],vous voulez être un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous avez un long chemin à parcourir, je pense.${prompt}
I, too, once took up arms for honor and country. But it was all in vain.${prompt};Je suis heureux que vous cherchez ma sagesse, mon enfant, mais vous êtes quand même trop insensible.${prompt}
I helped defend the nation. I tasted glory. But behind their smiles people grew jealous. I lost my family, and my comrades deserted me.${prompt};Moi aussi, j’ai pris les armes pour l’honneur et la patrie. Mais tout cela a été en vain.${prompt}
Soon I realized that all I did, everything I fought for was in vain. I left the ranks for good.${prompt};J’ai aidé à défendre la nation. J’ai goûté à la gloire. Mais derrière leurs sourires, les gens devenaient jaloux. J’ai perdu ma famille et mes camarades m’ont abandonné.${prompt}
But of late the beastmen rise in challenge. Again, many may lose dear friends and family to the storms of war.${prompt};Bientôt, j’ai réalisé que tout ce que j'avais fait, tout ce pour quoi je me battais était en vain. J’ai quitté les rangs pour de bon.${prompt}
I thought then of preventing such tragedy from happening again. Fortunately, an answer came to me.${prompt};Mais ces derniers temps, les hommes-bêtes relèvent le défi. Encore une fois, beaucoup risquent de perdre des amis et des membres de leur famille à cause des tempêtes de la guerre.${prompt}
I decided to teach my survival techniques to brave youths like yourself.${prompt};J’ai alors pensé à empêcher qu’une telle tragédie ne se reproduise. Heureusement, une réponse m’est venue.${prompt}
If you wish to learn them, you must prove your worthiness to me.${prompt};J’ai décidé d’enseigner mes techniques de survie à des jeunes courageux comme vous.${prompt}
Are you ready?;Si vous souhaitez les apprendre, vous devez me prouver votre valeur.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Êtes-vous prêt?
You bet.;
Not now.${prompt};Vous voulez parier?
Very well. First, bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. I shall wait here.${prompt};Pas maintenant.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} would be fine, too...if you can find one.${prompt};Très bien. D’abord, amène-moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. J’attendrai ici.${prompt}
I see.${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ce serait bien aussi... si vous pouvez en trouver un.${prompt}
Well? Have you found ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt};Je vois.${prompt}
Yes, this will do. I next desire ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Bien? Avez-vous trouvé ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}
Well done! Now for your final test. Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Then you will gain what you desire.${prompt};Oui, cela fera l’affaire. Je désire ensuite ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Splendid. As promised, I will now instruct you in a most precious skill. I call it a “support job.” Listen well to learn its secrets.${prompt};Bien joué! Maintenant pour votre dernier test. Apportez moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Ensuite, vous obtiendrez ce que vous désirez.${prompt}
Support jobs are undertaken anywhere you normally change jobs. And you must already be proficient in a job before you can declare it your support job.${prompt};Splendide. Comme promis, je vais maintenant vous enseigner une compétence des plus précieuses. J’appelle cela un « job de soutien ». Écoutez bien pour connaître ses secrets.${prompt}
Furthermore, the effective level of your support job can never exceed ${color: 5}half${color: 1} that of your main job. Also, since it is merely a support job, you'll never advance through experience.${prompt};Les jobs de soutien sont entrepris partout où vous changez habituellement de job. Et vous devez déjà maîtriser une job avant de pouvoir le déclarer comme job de soutien.${prompt}
I shall give an example. Let us say you have attained level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. You would obviously declare your main job warrior, and your support job white mage.${prompt};De plus, le niveau effectif de votre job de support ne pourra jamais dépasser ${color: 5}half${color: 1} celui de votre job principal. De plus, comme il ne s’agit que d’un travail d’accompagnement, vous n’avancerez jamais grâce à l’expérience..${prompt}
In this example, you fight as a warrior of 20 levels and as a white mage 10 levels lower. Thus, you would be performing both jobs to their maximum potential.${prompt};Je vais donner un exemple. Disons que vous avez atteint le niveau 20 en tant que guerrier et le niveau 10 en tant que mage blanc. Vous déclareriez évidemment votre job principal de guerrier et votre job de soutien de mage blanc.${prompt}
In contrast, if you had declared white mage your main job and warrior your support job, things would be very different!${prompt};Dans cet exemple, vous combattez en tant que guerrier de niveau 20 et en tant que mage blanc de 10 niveaux plus bas. Ainsi, vous effectueriez les deux tâches à leur potentiel maximum.${prompt}
Since you would have only 10 levels of experience as a white mage, your potential as a warrior would be reduced to half that of your main job. Thus, 5! Not a wise decision, is it?${prompt};En revanche, si vous aviez déclaré le mage blanc comme job principal et le guerrier comme job de soutien, les choses seraient bien différentes !${prompt}
Similarly, you wouldn't want to make your support job something you've never done before. If your support job level is less than half that of your main job, your undeveloped skills would make not a difference. Remember this well!${prompt};Puisque vous n’auriez que 10 niveaux d’expérience en tant que mage blanc, votre potentiel en tant que guerrier serait réduit de moitié par rapport à votre job principal. Donc 5 ! Ce n’est pas une sage décision, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I recommend you choose a support job that covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.${prompt};De même, vous ne voudriez pas faire de votre travail d’assistance quelque chose que vous n’avez jamais fait auparavant. Si votre niveau de job de soutien est inférieur à la moitié de celui de votre job principal, vos compétences sous-développées ne feront aucune différence. Souvenez-vous-en bien !${prompt}
I realize there is much to remember, my pupil.${prompt};Je vous recommande de choisir un job de support qui couvre les faiblesses de votre job principal, ou qui valorise ses points forts.${prompt}
Do you understand all that I have told you?;Je me rends compte qu’il y a beaucoup de choses à retenir, mon élève.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Comprenez-vous tout ce que je vous ai dit ?
Yes, I'm ready to go.;
Once more, please.${prompt};Oui, je suis prêt à partir.
Very good. Now, try your hand at a support job. You'll find it helpful in your journeys, I'm sure.${prompt};Encore une fois s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
You can now designate a support job.${prompt};Très bien. Maintenant, essayez-vous à un job de support. Vous le trouverez utile dans vos voyages, j’en suis sûr.${prompt}
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady], I know a quick and easy way to make money, but you can't handle it yet.${prompt};Vous pouvez désormais désigner un job de support.${prompt}
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady], you got some spare time? I know the road to easy money! Want to give it a try?${prompt};Hé ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], je connais un moyen rapide et facile de gagner de l’argent, mais vous ne pouvez pas encore le gérer.${prompt}
Interested?;Hé ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], vous avez du temps libre ? Je connais le chemin vers l’argent facile ! Vous voulez essayer?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Intéressé?
Yeah, so far.;
No way.${prompt};Ouais, jusqu'à présent.
Aw, give me the cold shoulder, will you? Well, you'll change your mind sooner or later, heheh.${prompt};Certainement pas.${prompt}
That's the spirit! You've just got to prove yourself, that's all. Find some loot I hid in Davoi, bring it to me, and you win.${prompt};Oh, donnez-moi la froideur, d’accord ? Eh bien, vous changerez d’avis tôt ou tard, heheh.${prompt}
But that's not all, ${choice-player-gender}[big shot/sweetheart]. You'll get cold, hard cash! You can pick how much time you think you'll need to do the job.${prompt};C’est ça l’esprit ! Il faut juste faire ses preuves, c’est tout. Trouvez le butin que j’ai caché à Davoi, apportez-le-moi et vous gagnerez.${prompt}
You'll have pockets full o' gil if you bring it back before the time's up. If not...well, then you don't get jack! Simple, ain't it?${prompt};Mais ce n’est pas tout, ${choice-player-gender}[grand coup/chérie]. Vous aurez de l’argent sonnant et trébuchant ! Vous pouvez choisir le temps dont vous pensez avoir besoin pour effectuer le travail.${prompt}
You want more spending money, right? Come on, give it a try! You can't afford not to!${prompt};Vous aurez les poches pleines de gil si vous le rapportez avant la fin du temps imparti. Si ce n’est pas le cas... eh bien, alors vous n’aurez pas de jack ! Simple, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Give it a try?;Vous voulez plus d’argent de poche, n’est-ce pas ? Allez, essayez-le ! Vous ne pouvez pas vous permettre de ne pas le faire !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Voulez-vous essayer?
I'm game.;
I'll pass, thanks.${prompt};Je suis partant.
Okay, whatever. But you'll never make the big time with that attitude. Prudes like you should stick to sellin' ${item-plural: 5[2]} to make ends meet.${prompt};Je passe mon tour, merci.${prompt}
That's the spirit! Life's nothin' but a game of chance, right? Here's the rules.${prompt};OK peu importe. Mais vous ne réussirez jamais grand chose avec cette attitude. Les prudes comme vous devraient s’en tenir à la vente ${item-plural: 5[2]} pour joindre les deux bouts.${prompt}
You gotta bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, hidden inside an urn in Davoi. And I ain't tellin' ya which one.${prompt};C’est l’idée! La vie n’est rien d’autre qu’un jeu de hasard, n’est-ce pas ? Voici les règles.${prompt}
But here's a hint: It's in an urn all by itself, not one that's bunched up with others. Eh, you'll figure it out once you get there.${prompt};Vous devrez m’amener ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, caché dans une urne à Davoi. Et je ne vous dirai pas lequel.${prompt}
Bets start at 100 gil! It goes 100, 250, 500, and the big 1000. Then choose a deadline of 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 hours.${prompt};Mais voici un indice : il est dans une urne tout seul, pas dans une urne regroupée avec d’autres. Eh, vous le découvrirez une fois sur place.${prompt}
And, the shorter the time, the bigger the payoff. You'll get triple if you make it back in 24 hours, but 72 only yields one and one-fifth.${prompt};Les paris commencent à 100 gils ! Cela va de 100, 250, 500 et le grand 1000. Choisissez ensuite un délai de 24, 36, 48, 60 ou 72 heures.${prompt}
I'll bet...;Et plus le temps est court, plus le gain est important. Vous obtiendrez le triple si vous revenez dans les 24 heures, mais 72 ne rapporte qu’un cinquième..${prompt}
${selection-lines};Je parie...
100 gil.;
250 gil.;
500 gil.;
1000 gil.;
5000 gil.;
I'll pass.${prompt};
I'll be back in;Je vais passer.${prompt}
${selection-lines};je reviendrai
24 hours for triple payout.;
36 hours for 2.5 times payout.;24 heures pour un triple paiement.
48 hours for double payout.;36 heures pour un paiement 2,5 fois supérieur.
60 hours for 1.5 times payout.;48 heures pour un double paiement.
72 hours for 1.2 times payout.;60 heures pour un paiement 1,5 fois supérieur.
Cancel${prompt};72 heures pour un paiement 1,2 fois supérieur.
So, you're betting me ${number: 2} gil that you'll be back here in ${number: 3} hours to hand me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. So what are you waitin' for? Get movin'!${prompt};Annuler${prompt}
The clock's tickin'! I told you, comb Davoi for ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in an urn somewhere. You got ${number: 1} hours left. Hey, I can chat all day if you want...${prompt};Alors vous me pariez ${number: 2} Gil, vous serz de retour ici dans ${number: 3} heures pour me donner ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. heures pour moi donner!${prompt}
Look what we got here! You made it in time! Congrats, the money's yours! Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};L’horloge tourne ! Je vous le dit, peignez Davoi pour ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} dans une urne quelque part. Vous avez ${number: 1} heures qui reste. Hé, je peux discuter toute la journée si vous voulez...${prompt}
Aw, too bad, hehe! You're late, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/sweetheart], so the money's mine. Of course, you can always give it another shot.${prompt};Regardez ce que nous avons ici ! Vous l’avez fait à temps ! Félicitations, l’argent est à vous ! Ne dépensez pas tout au même endroit.${prompt}
Hey! No IOU's! Pay up or stop wastin' my time.${prompt};Oh, dommage, hehe ! Vous êtes en retard, ${choice-player-gender}[copain/chérie], donc l’argent est à moi. Bien sûr, vous pouvez toujours tenter votre chance.${prompt}
You don't have enough gil.${prompt};Hé! Pas de reconnaissance de dette ! Payez ou arrêtez de perdre mon temps.${prompt}
Improper choice.${prompt};Vous n’avez pas assez de Gil.${prompt}
What, you fish, too? Yeah, I thought you knew a thing or two about fishin'. I can tell just by looking at you.${prompt};Choix incorrect.${prompt}
You're probably at that point where fishing really gets fun. Lemme fill you in on a little something:${prompt};Quoi, vous péchez aussi ? Ouais, je pensais que vous saviez une chose ou deux sur la pêche. Je peux le savoir rien qu’en vous regardant.${prompt}
Some fish got bad eating habits. You know, like the one that swallowed the ring?${prompt};Vous êtes probablement arrivés à ce point où la pêche devient vraiment amusante. Laissez-moi vous donner un petit quelque chose :${prompt}
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Bring me some fish like that. I'll gut it and check its innards for ya.${prompt};Certains poissons ont de mauvaises habitudes alimentaires. Vous savez, comme celui qui a avalé la bague ?${prompt}
If I find something, it's yours. Either way, I'll buy the fish off you, but I can't pay as much as any fancy-shmancy store does.${prompt};Ouais, c’est de ça que je parle. Apportez-moi du poisson comme ça. Je vais l’éviscérer et vérifier ses entrailles pour vous.${prompt}
It's up to you. You want cash, go to the guild. But if you want to chase your dreams, come see me!${prompt};Si je trouve quelque chose, c’est à vous. Quoi qu’il en soit, je vous achèterai le poisson, mais je ne peux pas payer autant que n’importe quel magasin de fantaisie.${prompt}
Stop by once in a while. I'll tell you what kind of fish you can catch.${prompt};C’est à vous de décider. Vous voulez de l’argent, allez à la guilde. Mais si vous voulez poursuivre vos rêves, venez me voir !${prompt}
Try ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, and ${item-singular: 3[2]}. They're all fish that like to gulp stuff down. Someone of your skill could easily catch one.${prompt};Passez nous voir de temps en temps. Je vais vous dire quel genre de poisson vous pouvez attraper.${prompt}
Someone of your skill could catch ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and ${item-singular: 4[2]}. They all like to gulp stuff down.${prompt};Essayer ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, et ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Ce sont tous des poissons qui aiment avaler des trucs. Quelqu’un de votre talent pourrait facilement en attraper un.${prompt}
Try ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]}. They're all fish that someone like you could catch. They love to gulp stuff down.${prompt};Quelqu’un de votre talent pourrait attraper ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, et ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Ils aiment tous avaler des trucs.${prompt}
And don't forget these: ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, ${item-singular: 4[2]}, and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};Essayer ${item-singular: 0[2]} et ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Ce sont tous des poissons que quelqu’un comme vous pourrait attraper. Ils adorent avaler des trucs.${prompt}
And don't forget these: ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, ${item-singular: 4[2]}, ${item-singular: 5[2]}, ${item-singular: 6[2]}, and ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt};Et n’oubliez pas ceux-ci : ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, ${item-singular: 4[2]}, et ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}
You caught one, eh? Hold on a minute, I'll gut it and see.${prompt};Et n’oubliez pas ceux-ci :: ${item-singular: 2[2]}, ${item-singular: 3[2]}, ${item-singular: 4[2]}, ${item-singular: 5[2]}, ${item-singular: 6[2]}, et ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
Hmm... Nope, nothing in here. Keep trying, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/lady]. I'm sure you'll get lucky soon.${prompt};Vous en avez attrapé un, hein ? Attends une minute, je vais le vider et voir.${prompt}
Look what this bugger had in his belly! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}! Here's the money for the fish, and here's your ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Good work!${prompt};Hmm... Non, rien ici. Continue d’essayer, ${choice-player-gender}[copain/dame]. Je suis sûr que vous aurez bientôt de la chance.${prompt}
What? I'm busy. Can't this wait till later?${prompt};Regardez ce que ce bougre avait dans le ventre ! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}! Voici l’argent pour le poisson, et voici votre ${item-singular: 1[2]}. Bon travail!${prompt}
What's all this? I didn't order anything.${prompt};Quoi? Je suis occupé. Cela ne peut-il pas attendre plus tard ?${prompt}
Who made this?;Qu'est-ce que c’est que tout ça ? Je n'ai rien commandé.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Qui a fait cette?
It was Rycharde.;
I'm not sure.${prompt};C'était Rycharde.
What? Rycharde made this? Nothing of his is worth eating!;Je ne suis pas sûr.${prompt}
Oh, why not? Just a taste...${prompt};Quoi? Rycharde a fait ça ? Rien de lui ne vaut la peine d'être mangé !
What is this garbage!? It's hardly edible! I knew he couldn't cook!${prompt};Oh pourquoi pas? Juste un avant-goût...${prompt}
Tell him something for me. Tell him he should give up cooking for good!${prompt};C’est quoi cette poubelle !? C'est à peine comestible ! Je savais qu’il ne savait pas cuisiner !${prompt}
Well, I won't take anything until I know who sent it. Tell me!${prompt};Dis-lui quelque chose pour moi. Dites-lui qu’il devrait arrêter de cuisiner pour de bon !${prompt}
What now? I've nothing to say to you. Good day!${prompt};Eh bien, je ne prendrai rien tant que je ne saurai pas qui l’a envoyé. Dites-moi !${prompt}
You again! What is it this time? I'd rather die than eat any more of his grub!${prompt};Et maintenant ? Je n’ai rien à vous dire. Bonne journée !${prompt}
What? You want me to cook something? I'm sure you're up to no good, but as a chef I can't turn you down.${prompt};Encore vous ! Qu’est-ce qu’il y a cette fois? Je préfère mourir plutôt que de manger encore de sa bouffe !${prompt}
Fine, then! I'll prepare your little dish, but first you must bring me the ingredients I require.${prompt};Quoi ? Vous voulez que je cuisine quelque chose ? Je suis sûr que vous ne faites rien de bon, mais en tant que chef, je ne peux pas vous refuser. ${prompt}
I'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now, make haste!${prompt};Très bien, alors ! Je vais préparer votre petit plat, mais vous devez d’abord m’apporter les ingrédients dont j’ai besoin.${prompt}
Where are those ingredients? I cannot start without them!${prompt};J’aurai besoin ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous!${prompt}
Hmph. So you found them, did you? Fine! Come see me tomorrow. It should be ready by then.${prompt};Où sont ces ingrédients ? Je ne peux pas commencer sans eux !${prompt}
What now? It's not done yet! Don't worry, my dishes are always ready on time.${prompt};Hmph. Alors vous les avez trouvés, n’est-ce pas ? Bien! Viens me voir demain. Il devrait être prêt d’ici là.${prompt}
Done! Now, take it and get out of here!${prompt};Et maintenant ? Ce n’est pas encore fait ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, mes plats sont toujours prêts à temps.${prompt}
What now? It's done, so leave me in peace!${prompt};Terminé ! Maintenant, prenez-le et sortez d’ici !${prompt}
Oh, you again. I hope you liked the dish.${prompt};Et maintenant ? C’est fait, alors laissez-moi tranquille !${prompt}
What, you again? Well, I'm not about to chastise you. Very well, I'll have a look. Give me a moment.${prompt};Oh, encore vous. J’espère que vous avez aimé le plat.${prompt}
It's true he has improved. But still he fails to grasp the basics of cooking. There's more to it than haggling over ingredients!${prompt};Quoi, encore vous ? Eh bien, je ne vais pas vous châtier. Très bien, je vais y jeter un oeil. Donnez-moi un moment.${prompt}
"Everything has a foundation, not just cooking. Making things good on the outside is easy; it is what's inside that counts.${prompt}";C’est vrai qu'il s’est amélioré. Mais il ne parvient toujours pas à maîtriser les bases de la cuisine. Il y a bien plus que marchander des ingrédients !${prompt}
"Only when one has understood the basics can they make the inside good. Amateurs hurry the most; too often they focus on appearance.${prompt}";"Tout a un fondement, pas seulement la cuisine. Faire du bien à l’extérieur est facile ; c'est ce qu'il y a à l’intérieur qui compte.${prompt}"
Rycharde is the perfect example. He simply isn't the prodigy I hoped for.${prompt};"Ce n’est que lorsqu'on a compris les bases qu’on peut rendre l’intérieur bon. Ce sont les amateurs qui se dépêchent le plus ; trop souvent, ils se concentrent sur l’apparence.${prompt}"
He may be my son, but he'll never be a chef in my eyes. Well, that's a lecture not meant for you.${prompt};Rycharde en est le parfait exemple. Il n’est tout simplement pas le prodige que j’espérais.${prompt}
Are you heading back now? Please, give this to him. Tell him it's my reply. If he doesn't understand what it means, then that will be it.${prompt};C’est peut-être mon fils, mais il ne sera jamais un chef à mes yeux. Eh bien, ce n’est pas une conférence pour vous.${prompt}
You gave it to him, did you not? I do hope he understood.${prompt};Vous rentrez maintenant ? S’il vous plaît, donnez-lui ceci. Dis-lui que c'est ma réponse. S’il ne comprend pas ce que cela signifie, alors ce sera tout.${prompt}
You gave it to him, did you not? Back when I started teaching him how to cook, I often had him use ${item-plural: 0[2]} in his dishes.${prompt};Vous le lui avez donné, n’est-ce pas ? J’espère qu’il a compris.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} come cheaply of late. But that doesn't rule them out as ingredients.${prompt};Vous le lui avez donné, n’est-ce pas ? À l’époque où j’ai commencé à lui apprendre à cuisiner, je lui faisais souvent utiliser ${item-plural: 0[2]} dans ses plats.${prompt}
You could also use pricey ingredients, and even though your utensils might be mediocre, your food will still come out tasting fine.${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} venir à bas prix ces derniers temps. Mais cela ne les exclut pas comme ingrédients.${prompt}
Delicious food is not made from fancy spices or cutlery. Nor does it come from any methodical analysis.${prompt};Vous pouvez également utiliser des ingrédients coûteux, et même si vos ustensiles sont médiocres, vos aliments auront toujours bon goût.${prompt}
Indeed, nothing is more crucial than the desire to satisfy others with good food, and thinking up ways to do it.${prompt};Les plats délicieux ne sont pas préparés à partir d’épices ou de couverts sophistiqués. Cela ne provient pas non plus d’une analyse méthodique.${prompt}
If my son could only realize that, there may still be some hope for him.${prompt};En effet, rien n’est plus crucial que le désir de satisfaire les autres avec de la bonne nourriture et d’imaginer des moyens d’y parvenir.${prompt}
Cooking is a complex art, but the basics are as clear as day. I suppose that goes for just about anything.${prompt};Si seulement mon fils pouvait réaliser cela, il y aurait peut-être encore un espoir pour lui.${prompt}
Never forget to give thanks at each meal. The hands of many work hard to bring us sustenance.${prompt};La cuisine est un art complexe, mais les bases sont aussi claires que le jour. Je suppose que cela vaut pour à peu près tout.${prompt}
Hello there. I'm Mathilde, and my daddy runs this guild shop.${prompt};N’oubliez jamais de rendre grâce à chaque repas. Les mains de nombreuses personnes travaillent dur pour nous apporter notre subsistance.${prompt}
We only sell goods he hand-picks himself. So rest easy knowing you're getting quality merchandise every time you shop!${prompt};Bonjour. Je m’appelle Mathilde et mon père dirige cette boutique de guilde.${prompt}
Why, hello. My daughter and I are holding the fort again. Oh, that husband of mine's always out watching his precious sheep.${prompt};Nous vendons uniquement des produits qu’il sélectionne lui-même. Alors soyez tranquille en sachant que vous obtenez des produits de qualité à chaque fois que vous magasinez ! ${prompt}
My daughter Mathilde married about five years ago. She gave us a grandson, and he's such a good little boy!${prompt};Pourquoi, bonjour. Ma fille et moi tenons à nouveau le fort. Oh, mon mari est toujours dehors pour surveiller ses précieux moutons.${prompt}
I always tell my husband how lucky we are!${prompt};Ma fille Mathilde s’est mariée il y a environ cinq ans. Elle nous a donné un petit-fils, et c’est un si bon petit garçon !${prompt}
But you see, Mathilde is adopted. Everyone says we get along better than most real families, though.${prompt};Je dis toujours à mon mari à quel point nous avons de la chance !${prompt}
My husband found her out on a trade route when she was just a child, and brought her back home with him. I can't believe twenty years could go by so quickly!${prompt};Mais vous voyez, Mathilde est adoptée. Cependant, tout le monde dit que nous nous entendons mieux que la plupart des vraies familles.${prompt}
The thing is, she had no memory of her past. She couldn't even remember her name. She didn't seem hurt anywhere, so she must have been through some terrible ordeal. Poor little thing...${prompt};Mon mari l’a découverte sur une route commerciale alors qu’elle n'était qu’une enfant et l’a ramenée à la maison avec lui. Je ne peux pas croire que vingt ans puissent passer si vite !${prompt}
My husband thinks her family was preyed upon by monsters, and she was the only survivor. The whole world was at war then, and such tragedies were commonplace.${prompt};Le fait est qu’elle n’avait aucun souvenir de son passé. Elle ne se souvenait même pas de son nom. Elle ne semblait blessée nulle part, elle avait donc dû traverser une terrible épreuve. Pauvre petite chose...${prompt}
She still remembers nothing about those times. Nothing, except for a certain boy's name. He must have been a very important person to her.${prompt};Mon mari pense que sa famille était la proie de monstres et qu’elle était la seule survivante. Le monde entier était alors en guerre, et de telles tragédies étaient monnaie courante.${prompt}
Hello again. We have lots of fine things in today. Take your time!${prompt};Elle ne se souvient toujours de rien de cette époque. Rien, à part le nom d'un certain garçon. Il devait être une personne très importante pour elle.${prompt}
I'm home!${prompt};Re-bonjour. Nous avons beaucoup de belles choses aujourd’hui. Prenez votre temps !${prompt}
Hi, Aldo.${prompt};Je suis à la maison !${prompt}
Mom, look! I found this on the beach. It's for you!${prompt};Bonjour, Aldo.${prompt}
What a pretty seashell! Thank you.${prompt};Maman, regarde ! J’ai trouvé ça sur la plage. C’est pour toi !${prompt}
Ashtia's waiting for me. Gotta go!${prompt};Quel joli coquillage ! Merci.
Take care!${prompt};Ashtia m’attend. Je dois y aller !${prompt}
Always do!${prompt};Fait attention !${prompt}
I'll get one for you too, Grandma!${prompt};Fait-le toujours !${prompt}
Why thanks, Aldo. That would be nice.${prompt};Je t’en chercherai un aussi, grand-mère !${prompt}
He comes and goes like a cyclone, that boy!${prompt};Pourquoi merci, Aldo. Ce serait bien.${prompt}
My little treasure, that Aldo. Where could my other precious Aldo be? He could be out there somewhere...${prompt};Il va et vient comme un cyclone, ce garçon !${prompt}
No, he must be out there. He's leading a happy life somewhere. Look at us: we live so far apart under the very same sky.${prompt};Mon petit trésor, cet Aldo. Où pourrait être mon autre précieux Aldo ? Il pourrait être là quelque part...${prompt}
Good to see you. Once you reach my age, you'll realize that you have to work or you'll never get out of bed.${prompt};Non, il doit être là-bas. Il mène une vie heureuse quelque part. Regardez-nous : nous vivons si loin les uns des autres sous le même ciel.${prompt}
You've met Aldo, haven't you? Isn't he such a nice little boy? I always tell my husband how blessed we are for both a child and a grandchild!${prompt};Content de te voir. Une fois que tu auras mon âge, tu réaliseras que tu dois travailler sinon tu ne sortiras jamais du lit.${prompt}
You want something? I've been a fisherman here since the dawn of time! Of course, I have a little side-business, too.${prompt};Vous avez rencontré Aldo, n’est-ce pas ? N’est-il pas un si gentil petit garçon ? Je dis toujours à mon mari à quel point nous sommes bénis pour un enfant et un petit-enfant !${prompt}
If you want to learn about fishing, just ask Gabwaleid. He doesn't look it, but he knows quite a bit. I taught him everything! Haha!${prompt};Vous voulez quelque chose ? Je suis pêcheur ici depuis la nuit des temps ! Bien sûr, j'ai aussi quelques activités annexes.${prompt}
What can I do for you? I'm Gabwaleid. Someday I want to be a real fisherman like Zaldon.${prompt};Si vous souhaitez en apprendre davantage sur la pêche, demandez simplement à Gabwaleid. Il n’en a pas l’air, mais il en sait beaucoup. Je lui ai tout appris ! Haha !
You have to pick the right bait depending on what fish you want to catch. Otherwise it's all a waste!${prompt};Que puis-je faire pour vous ? Je m'appelle Gabwaleid. Un jour, je veux être un vrai pêcheur comme Zaldon.${prompt}
You have to be aware of the time of day and the weather, too. Try to fish at the best time and under the best weather.${prompt};Il faut choisir le bon appât en fonction du poisson que l’on souhaite attraper. Sinon, c’est du gaspillage !${prompt}
You'll catch different fish depending on where you are. Of course, there's a big difference between fishing from the river and from the sea.${prompt};Vous devez également être conscient de l’heure de la journée et de la météo. Essayez de pêcher au meilleur moment et dans les meilleures conditions météorologiques.${prompt}
Oh, and one more thing... It hardly ever happens, but once in a while something...unexpected may bite. Be careful!${prompt};Vous attraperez des poissons différents selon l’endroit où vous vous trouvez. Bien sûr, il y a une grande différence entre pêcher en rivière et en mer.${prompt}
There's nothing better than fishing from the ship. There are so many unique things to catch. The time just flies!${prompt};Oh, et encore une chose... Cela n’arrive presque jamais, mais de temps en temps, quelque chose... d’inattendu peut mordre. Soyez prudent !${prompt}
There's nothing wrong with bait, but I go for lures, myself. You can keep using them till your line breaks or your pole snaps. Of course, they cost more.${prompt};Il n’y a rien de mieux que de pêcher depuis le bateau. Il y a tellement de choses uniques à attraper. Le temps passe vite !${prompt}
Say, have you heard? Pirates roam the seas between Selbina and Mhaura. You watch out. One never knows when they'll strike next!${prompt};Il n’y a rien de mal avec les appâts, mais moi-même, je choisis des leurres. Vous pouvez continuer à les utiliser jusqu’à ce que votre ligne se brise ou que votre canne se casse. Bien sûr, ils coûtent plus cher.${prompt}
Orcs to the north, turtlebacks to the south... With the ocean now swarming with corsairs, our village is the only haven!${prompt};Dites, avez-vous entendu ? Les pirates parcourent les mers entre Selbina et Mhaura. Faites attention. On ne sait jamais quand ils frapperont la prochaine fois !${prompt}
Been to Jeuno yet? They say that none may question the worth of a man who's walked to Jeuno.${prompt};Orcs au nord, tortues au sud... Avec l’océan désormais grouillant de corsaires, notre village est le seul refuge !${prompt}
We work the docks. Trade ships couldn't sail without us, but I guess we'd starve without them, too.${prompt};Vous êtes déjà allé à Jeuno ? On dit que personne ne peut remettre en question la valeur d’un homme qui a marché jusqu’à Jeuno.${prompt}
Keep a sharp eye out for pirates. Word is they strike using uncanny powers. They say it's the truth, believe it or not.${prompt};Nous travaillons sur les quais. Les navires commerciaux ne pourraient pas naviguer sans nous, mais je suppose que nous mourrions de faim sans eux aussi.${prompt}
I hear many Humes in Bastok look down on us Galka.${prompt};Gardez un œil attentif sur les pirates. On dit qu’ils frappent en utilisant des pouvoirs étranges. Ils disent que c’est la vérité, croyez-le ou non.${prompt}
Nobody is like that here in Selbina. Here, race is no issue. All that matters is an open mind.${prompt};J’entends beaucoup de Humes à Bastok nous mépriser, Galka.${prompt}
Our town is equally far from all the great nations. You can go to Bastok, you can go to San d'Oria--all roads are just as risky.${prompt};Personne n’est comme ça ici à Selbina. Ici, la race n’est pas un problème. Tout ce qui compte, c’est l’ouverture d’esprit.${prompt}
My husband's out fishing. Lots of good fish bite here.${prompt};Notre ville est également éloignée de toutes les grandes nations. Vous pouvez aller à Bastok, vous pouvez aller à San d’Oria :toutes les routes sont tout aussi risquées.${prompt}
We're playing hide-and-go-seek. I wonder where the other three are...${prompt};Mon mari est à la pêche. Beaucoup de bons poissons mordent ici.${prompt}
Oh, you found me first! I knew this would be a bad hiding place.${prompt};Nous jouons à cache-cache. Je me demande où sont les trois autres...${prompt}
Whoa, you scared me! Please, don't tell them I'm here!${prompt};Oh, vous m’avez trouvé en premier ! Je savais que ce serait une mauvaise cachette.${prompt}
I'd hide further back, but there's a scary man there. I'm so afraid they'll find me here!${prompt};Whoa, vous m’avez fait peur ! S'il vous plaît, ne leur dites pas que je suis là !${prompt}
Ha! He'll never find me here! Oh, wait... He is really good at finding us...${prompt};Je me cacherais plus loin, mais il y a un homme effrayant là-bas. J’ai tellement peur qu’ils me trouvent ici !${prompt}
This is the mayor's mansion. Our mayor is a good man. Go inside and say hello.${prompt};Ha ! Il ne me trouvera jamais ici ! Oh, attends... Il est vraiment doué pour nous trouver...${prompt}
The Valkurm Dunes is Selbina's territory, but our militia is too few to patrol it. It is sad, but you adventurers must keep the sands safe.${prompt};C’est le manoir du maire. Notre maire est un homme bon. Entrez et dites bonjour.${prompt}
Oh, you again. Thanks for all you've done for us. We need all the help we can get.${prompt};Les dunes de Valkurm sont le territoire de Selbina, mais notre milice est trop peu nombreuse pour y patrouiller. C’est triste, mais vous, les aventuriers, devez garder le sable en sécurité.${prompt}
No reports of trouble recently. For us, no news is good news!${prompt};Oh, encore vous. Merci pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour nous. Nous avons besoin de toute l’aide possible.${prompt}
Our village may be small, but so many stop here to rest on the road between Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt};Aucun problème signalé récemment. Pour nous, aucune nouvelle n’est une bonne nouvelle !${prompt}
Sorry, the station is for militia personnel only.${prompt};Notre village est peut-être petit, mais tant de gens s’arrêtent ici pour se reposer sur la route entre Bastok et San d’Oria.${prompt}
If you're heading outside, remember that there's safety in numbers. Gather people of different talents to cover any weaknesses.${prompt};Désolé, la station est réservée au personnel de la milice.${prompt}
If you're here for the ship, the docks are straight down the stairs from here.${prompt};Si vous sortez, n’oubliez pas que la sécurité réside dans le nombre. Rassemblez des personnes de différents talents pour couvrir les éventuelles faiblesses.${prompt}
I'm Velema. I keep watch over the docks.${prompt};Si vous êtes ici pour le navire, les quais se trouvent juste en bas des escaliers à partir d’ici.${prompt}
Is there a problem? See the mayor if you have any questions.${prompt};Je m’appelle Velema. Je surveille les quais.${prompt}
Visitors often ask me how to find the mines of Palborough. What could they want from its dark and twisting tunnels?${prompt};Y a-t-il un problème? Consultez le maire si vous avez des questions.${prompt}
Have you visited the mayor's office yet? That Naillina knows so much about everything!${prompt};Les visiteurs me demandent souvent comment trouver les mines de Palborough. Que pourraient-ils attendre de ses tunnels sombres et tortueux ?${prompt}
I've noticed an awfully suspicious-looking fellow visit town recently. Have you seen him?${prompt};Avez-vous déjà visité la mairie ? Que Naillina en sait tellement sur tout !${prompt}
Isacio used to be a knight a long time ago. I wonder what brought him here...${prompt};J’ai récemment remarqué qu’un homme à lvair terriblement suspect était en visite en ville. L’avez-vous vu ?${prompt}
Zaldon has all kinds of tales to tell. But he's so stubborn your head will ache!${prompt};Isacio était chevalier il y a longtemps. Je me demande ce qui l’a amené ici...${prompt}
Gabwaleid actually knows a lot about fishing. He'll teach you whatever you need to know.${prompt};Zaldon a toutes sortes d’histoires à raconter. Mais il est tellement têtu que vous en aurez mal à la tête !${prompt}
The inn's cook, Valgeir, whips up some fantastic dishes. I wish I had enough money to try one!${prompt};Gabwaleid en sait beaucoup sur la pêche. Il vous apprendra tout ce que vous devez savoir.${prompt}
Mayor Abelard is more like a scientist than a politician. He's into some kind of research.${prompt};Le cuisinier de l’auberge, Valgeir, concocte des plats fantastiques. J’aurais aimé avoir assez d’argent pour en essayer un !${prompt}
Vuntar's an earnest worker. Come to think of it, he's been working here as long as I can remember...${prompt};Le maire Abélard ressemble plus à un scientifique qu’à un homme politique. Il mène une sorte de recherche.${prompt}
Melyon is so proud of his sheep, isn't he? He's thought up interesting names for them.${prompt};Vuntar est un travailleur sérieux. À bien y penser, il travaille ici depuis aussi longtemps que je me souvienne...${prompt}
Romeo is always thinking up new ways to make money. And I think he's pretty good at it, too.${prompt};Melyon est tellement fier de ses moutons, n’est-ce pas ? Il leur a trouvé des noms intéressants.${prompt}
My name's Manfried and I'm a deputy along with Flandiace. Velema's our sergeant, and the three of us serve under Thunder Hawk.${prompt};Roméo imagine toujours de nouvelles façons de gagner de l’argent. Et je pense qu’il est plutôt bon dans ce domaine aussi.${prompt}
Hello!${prompt};Je m’appelle Manfried et je suis député avec Flandiace. Velema est notre sergent et nous servons tous les trois sous les ordres de Thunder Hawk.${prompt}

Which memory will you have recalled?;

Nothing.;
Emissary from the Seas.;

The Beginning(pt.1).;
The Beginning(pt.2).${prompt};
Do we have a mannequin!? What do you think we are, crazy? Because that's what you'd have to be to have one of those cursed things in your shop!${prompt};
Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. Beastmen, ${choice-player-gender}[young boy/young girl]. Beastmen!;
I'd keep your whipper-snapping hands off those evil dolls unless you want to be robbed or kidnapped...or worse.${prompt};
Why? Because my grandfather told me, that's why! You wouldn't be calling my grandfather a liar now, would you?${prompt};
Wait a minute...;
If you really want to learn more about those goddessforsaken contraptions, I think I might have something that can help you.${prompt};
Here, take this catalog.;
Oh, don't worry about reimbursing me. Even pictures of those mannequins give me the chills. I'm just glad to have them out of my sight!${prompt};
You want to make one!? Well, it's your funeral.;
I heard they were made of wood, so there might be someone in San d'Oria that could help you. But that's all you'll get out of me.${prompt};
Hello?;
Can I help you...?${prompt};
Your name wouldn't be Emeline, by any chance?${prompt};
My name is Ulmia.;
We were in the choir together, do you remember...?${prompt};
...?${prompt};
I'm sorry, I don't remember much about my childhood.${prompt};
But I'm sure you must be mistaken. My name is Mathilde.;
I work here at the Weavers' Guild.${prompt};
...;
Yes, you're right, I must be mistaken.;
Please accept my apologies.${prompt};
You so resemble a girl that used to sing in the choir with me, I just...${prompt};
You don't happen to have a younger brother, do you?${prompt};
A younger brother...;
Why, yes, I did have a younger brother, only...;
We were separated in the war.${prompt};
But I believe he is still out there...somewhere...;
I do hope he is happy...${prompt};
I am sorry to have brought up this painful subject.;
I'll be on my way...${prompt};
I have one last request for you.${prompt};
There is a certain song that you might know.;
Will you sing it for us?${prompt};
A...song?${prompt};
I am sure you have this song locked somewhere in your heart. Please try to remember.${prompt};
The Tavnazian Cathedral...;
Cardinal Mildaurion...;
A song known as the “Lay of the Immortals”...${prompt};
The fifth verse...;
And so the legend ends...${prompt};
...began......crystal......${prompt};
...;
Was that some kind of spell...?${prompt};
The Mimeo Mirror is a device known by any self-respecting rogue.;
It was finally returned to me.${prompt};Ulmia, êtes-vous capable de chanter le couplet que nous venons d’entendre ?${prompt}
Ulmia, are you able to sing the verse we just heard?${prompt};Mais je...!${prompt}
But, I...!${prompt};Vous avez effectivement tendance à vous attendre au pire, chère Ulmia..${prompt}
You do have a penchant for expecting the worst, dear Ulmia.${prompt};Cette mélodie n’est peut-être pas du tout nécessaire.${prompt}
There may not be a need for that melody at all.${prompt};
I...!?;
Why would that be?${prompt};
Once Lord Bahamut sees Prishe's magicite, it may be enough to convince him. And...${prompt};
And we would not want to lose the Star of Tavnazia...${prompt};
...?;
What do you mean?${prompt};
...;
There is something I would like to ask Prishe.;
Ulmia, let us meet with her in Jeuno.${prompt};
${name-player}, please go on ahead to Bastok.${prompt};
${wait-animation: 1};Je m’appelle Abélard, maire de ce village.${prompt}
I'm Abelard, mayor of this village.${prompt};Vous dites que vous recherchez Dame Leffine ?${prompt}
You say you're looking for Lady Leffine?${prompt};Vous n’êtes pas le premier à poser cette question, mais je suis désolé de vous dire qu’il n’y a personne ici de ce nom.${prompt}
You're not the first to ask that question, but I'm sorry to say there's no one here by that name.${prompt};Même si on vous a demandé de le faire, vous ne devriez pas fouiller dans le passé des autres.${prompt}
Even if you've been requested to do so, you shouldn't be poking around into other people's pasts.${prompt};Qu'est ce que c'est?
What's that?;Alors pourquoi est-ce que j'essaie de découvrir Gwynham Ironheart, demandez-vous ?${prompt}
So why am I trying to find out about Gwynham Ironheart, you ask?${prompt};Bien sûr, j'ai fait des recherches sur le passé d'Ironheart, mais...${prompt}
Sure, I've been doing research into Ironheart's past, but...${prompt};Ce n'est pas la même chose, ${choice-player-gender}[fils/fille].
That's not the same thing, ${choice-player-gender}[sonny/lass].;Je n'ai pas le moindre intérêt pour sa vie privée.${prompt}
I haven't got the slightest interest in his private life.${prompt};Je sais déjà tout ce qu’il y a à savoir sur lui, en tout cas.${prompt}
I already know all there is to know about him, in any case.${prompt};Avez-vous entendu parler de Lord Torresapet B Ordelle ?
Have you heard of Lord Torresapet B Ordelle?;On craignait qu'il ne meure d'une mort démente dans les grottes d'Ordelle avant d'avoir terminé la carte de ces tunnels tordus.${prompt}
It was feared he would die a demented death in Ordelle's Caves before he completed the map of those twisted tunnels.${prompt};Il a rassemblé les faits sur la vie de Gwynham Ironheart en un seul volume. J’ai le livre juste là.${prompt}
He gathered the facts about Gwynham Ironheart's life into a single volume. I have the book right there.${prompt};C’est juste que...
It's just that...;Avant que ce livre n’entre en ma possession, la fille de Gwynham, Enid, a déchiré plusieurs pages et les a jetées.${prompt}
Before that book came into my possession, Gwynham's daughter, Enid, tore out several pages and threw them away.${prompt};Je suis curieux de savoir ce qui a été écrit sur ces pages, mais je suppose qu’il y a une raison pour laquelle Enid les a supprimées en premier lieu.${prompt}
I'm curious as to what was written on those pages, but I suppose there's a reason Enid removed them in the first place.${prompt};Je suppose que je devrais respecter cela.
I guess I should respect that.;De plus, je doute que quiconque puisse les trouver de toute façon...${prompt}
Besides, I doubt anyone could find them anyway...${prompt};Ce sont les pages manquantes !
Th-these are the missing pages!;Où les avez-vous trouvés !?${prompt}
Where did you find them!?${prompt};Ils ont été laissés à l’intérieur des grottes d’Ordelle...?${prompt}
They were left inside Ordelle's Caves...?${prompt};Si quelqu’un a volontairement laissé ces pages, nous avons le devoir de les lire. On dirait qu’Enid ne les a pas jetés après tout.${prompt}
If somebody left these pages on purpose, then we have a duty to read them. Seems that Enid didn't throw them away after all.${prompt};Hein ?
Hm?;Si je dois lire ces pages, alors je devrais vous dire où trouver Dame Leffine ?${prompt}
If I'm going to read these pages, then I should tell you where to find Lady Leffine?${prompt};Assez juste.
Fair enough.;Tout comme la grande Gwynham Ironheart, Dame Leffine est décédée il y a de nombreuses années.${prompt}
As did the great Gwynham Ironheart, Lady Leffine passed away many years ago.${prompt};Cependant, son fils, Louverance, a grandi pour devenir un bon jeune homme.
However, her son, Louverance, grew up to become a fine young man.;Aux dernières nouvelles, il a rejoint les Chevaliers Royaux de San d'Oria.${prompt}
Last I heard, he joined the Royal Knights of San d'Oria.${prompt};Cependant, je ne l'ai pas vu se rendre sur la tombe de sa mère ces derniers temps.
I haven't seen him visit his mother's grave lately, though.;Est-ce que quelque chose lui est arrivé, je me demande.${prompt}
Has something happened to him, I wonder.${prompt};En parlant de ça, il y a autre chose qui me dérange.${prompt}
Speaking of which, there's another thing that's been bugging me.${prompt};Plus tôt, j’ai eu un autre visiteur qui cherchait Louverance.${prompt}
Earlier, I had another visitor looking for Louverance.${prompt};C’était une jeune dame Hume. J’ai fait mention du groupe d’Atarefaunet.${prompt}
It was a young Hume lady. Made some mention of Atarefaunet's Band.${prompt};Quoi qu’il en soit, elle a quitté Selbina après avoir découvert que Dame Leffine n’était plus avec nous.${prompt}
In any case, she left Selbina after discovering Lady Leffine was no longer with us.${prompt};C'est tout ce que tu voulais savoir ?
Is that all you wanted to know?;Maintenant, si cela ne vous dérange pas, je vais commencer à lire les pages que vous avez récupérées.${prompt}
Now if you don't mind, I'll get to reading these pages you retrieved.${prompt};Une fille du nom de Sanctia ?
A girl by the name of Sanctia?;Oui, il me semble me souvenir d'une jeune femme qui arrivait en ville il y a quelque temps, puis repartait directement.
Yes, I seem to recall a young lady blowing into town quite a while back, and then blowing straight back out.;Elle vous a manqué, j'en ai bien peur.${prompt}
You've missed her, I'm afraid.${prompt};Ne vous l'ai-je pas déjà dit ?
Didn't I tell you this already?;C'est une jeune fille de Hume qui a mentionné le groupe d'Atarefaunet, tu te souviens ?${prompt}
It was a young Hume girl that mentioned Atarefaunet's Band, remember?${prompt};Elle a dit qu’elle cherchait un chasseur de primes qui avait croisé ce groupe de coupe-gorges impitoyables.${prompt}
She said she was looking for some bounty hunter that had crossed that group of merciless cutthroats.${prompt};Des rumeurs circulent en ville selon lesquelles Louverance recherchait exactement le même homme...${prompt}
Talk around town says that Louverance was searching for the very same man...${prompt};Elle voulait rencontrer quelqu’un qui vivait ici il y a longtemps.${prompt}
She wanted to meet with someone that lived here a long time ago.${prompt};On dirait qu’elle voulait lui poser des questions sur un chasseur de primes qu’il recherchait...${prompt}
Seems she meant to ask him about some bounty hunter he was looking for...${prompt};Hein ? La jeune femme était déterminée à trouver son chemin vers l'archipel de Tavnazian ?
Hm? The young lady was determined to find her way to the Tavnazian Archipelago?;Et vous pensez qu'elle est allée dans l'une des grottes des dunes de Valkurm ?${prompt}
And you think she went to one of the caves in the Valkurm Dunes?${prompt};Nous avons reçu un avertissement d’un haut fonctionnaire jeunoen de ne pas nous approcher du vortex dans cette grotte.${prompt}
We've had a warning from a high-ranking Jeunoan official not to go anywhere near the vortex in that cave.${prompt};Les rumeurs disent que les voyageurs attirés dans ses profondeurs ne sont plus jamais entendus.
Rumors say that travelers drawn into its depths are never heard from again.;Il est peut-être trop tard pour sauver votre ami.${prompt}
You might be too late to save your friend.${prompt};La jeune femme est-elle vraiment entrée dans cette grotte des dunes de Valkurm ?${prompt}
Did the young lady really go into that cave in the Valkurm Dunes?${prompt};Elle est soit extrêmement courageuse, soit extrêmement stupide pour essayer d’atteindre Tavnazia à travers ce vortex.${prompt}
She's either extremely brave or extremely foolish to try and reach Tavnazia through that vortex.${prompt};J’ai en route un tableau d'une artiste nommée Angelica.${prompt}
I've got me a painting on the way from an artist named Angelica.${prompt};Elle est plutôt connue des aventuriers, j’ai donc hâte de la voir travailler.${prompt}
She's pretty well known among adventurers, so I can't wait to see her work.${prompt};Je suis vraiment allé et j’ai atterri dedans cette fois...${prompt}
I've really gone and landed myself in it this time...${prompt};Je dois... Non, je ne peux pas. C’est horrible !${prompt}
I've got to... No, I can't. This is awful!${prompt};Oh, désolé. Je ne vous ai pas vu là-bas. Je pensais juste.${prompt}
Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there. I was just thinking.${prompt};Hé, seriez-vous un aventurier ?${prompt}
Hey, would you happen to be an adventurer?${prompt};je le savais !${prompt}
I knew it!${prompt};Si vous avez un moment, pourriez-vous écouter ce que j’ai à dire ?${prompt}
If you have a moment, could you listen to what I have to say?${prompt};Écoutez les problèmes de Diederik ?
Listen to Diederik's problems?;
${selection-lines};Bien sûr.
Sure.;Je suis occupé en ce moment.${prompt}
I'm busy right now.${prompt};Oh merci! Je commençais à désespérer !${prompt}
Oh, thank you! I was starting to get desperate!${prompt};Eh bien, continuez votre travail, alors. Désolé de vous déranger !${prompt}
Well, be on with your work, then. Sorry for bothering you!${prompt};J’ai des nœuds dans l’estomac à cause de ça...${prompt}
I've been working knots in my stomach worrying about this...${prompt};Quoi qu’il en soit, je suppose que je ferais mieux de commencer depuis le début.${prompt}
Anyway, I guess I'd better start from the beginning.${prompt};Le nom est Diederik. Je travaille actuellement comme intermédiaire pour répondre aux besoins de mes clients.${prompt}
The name's Diederik. I'm currently working as a middleman to fulfill my customers' needs.${prompt};L’autre jour, un de mes clients, un vieil homme de Bastok, m’a dit qu’il voulait un tableau. J’ai donc passé commande auprès d’un peintre de Windurst.${prompt}
The other day, one of my clients, an old man in Bastok, said he wanted a painting. So I put in an order with a painter from Windurst.${prompt};Elle s’appelait... Angelica, je pense que oui. Elle semble être plutôt connue des aventuriers.${prompt}
Her name was...Angelica, I think it was. She seems to be rather well known among adventurers.${prompt};Quoi qu’il en soit, j’ai récupéré le tableau terminé et tout semblait bien se passer...${prompt}
Anyway, I picked up the finished painting and everything seemed to be going fine...${prompt};Autrement dit, jusqu’à ce que mon navire soit attaqué par des pirates.${prompt}
That is, until my ship was attacked by pirates.${prompt};Nous avons eu de la chance que personne à bord n’ait été blessé. Mais après, je n’ai trouvé le tableau nulle part.${prompt}
We were lucky that no one on board was harmed. But afterwards, I couldn't find the painting anywhere.${prompt};Mais je suis censé le livrer bientôt, et ça me fait transpirer rien que d’y penser !${prompt}
I'm supposed to deliver it soon, though, and it puts me in a sweat just thinking about it!${prompt};Non seulement ça, mais mon client est un vieil homme grincheux qui me coincera par les oreilles s’il n’obtient pas ce qu’il veut ! Je ne peux pas y faire face !${prompt}
Not only that, but my client is a cranky old man who'll string me up by the ears if he doesn't get what he wants! I can't face that!${prompt};Il ne va pas me laisser s’en sortir facilement après avoir perdu son précieux tableau.${prompt}
He's not going to let me off easy after losing his precious painting.${prompt};Même expliquer ce qui s’est passé ne servirait à rien avec une personne aussi aigre.${prompt}
Even explaining what happened wouldn't do any good with such a sour person.${prompt};C’est pourquoi je ne peux pas aller vers lui. Je ne sais pas ce que je dirais ! J’étais sur le point de retourner voir Angelica et de voir si elle allait refaire le tableau pour moi...${prompt}
That's why I can't go to him. I don't know what I'd say! I was about to go back to Angelica and see if she would redo the painting for me...${prompt};...mais je ne peux pas lui dire non plus ! Elle est tellement passionnée et aime tellement son métier que j’ai peur de m’effondrer si je voyais la déception sur son visage lorsque je lui ai dit que j’avais perdu le tableau.${prompt}
...but I can't tell her, either! She's so passionate and loves her craft so much, I'm afraid I'd break down if I saw the disappointment on her face when I told her I lost the painting.${prompt};Vous voyez, je suis désespéré. Je ne peux pas porter ce fardeau seul !${prompt}
You see, I'm hopeless. I can't carry this burden alone!${prompt};Hé ! Vous êtes un aventurier, alors je parie que vous connaissez Angelica, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Hey! You're an adventurer, so I bet you know Angelica, don't you?${prompt};Vous avez même été mannequin pour l’un de ses tableaux ? Excellent !
You even modeled for one of her paintings? Excellent!${prompt};Je parie qu’elle vous écouterait si vous lui demandiez de refaire un tableau...${prompt}
I bet she would listen to you if you asked her to redo a painting...${prompt};Hé ! Je viens d’avoir une idée géniale ! Pourquoi n’irez-vous pas demander à Angelica de refaire le tableau ?${prompt}
Hey! I just got a brilliant idea! Why don't you go and ask Angelica to redo the painting?${prompt};Vous venez d’entendre pourquoi je ne pouvais pas y aller ! Vous êtes ma seule option !${prompt}
You just heard why I couldn't go! You're my only option!${prompt};Vous êtes son amie, alors bien sûr, elle vous écoutera !${prompt}
You're her friend, so of course she'll listen to you!${prompt};Non pas que j’aie le courage d’affronter ce vieux Scrooge seul non plus...${prompt}
Not that I have the courage to face that old scrooge alone, either...${prompt};
Oh hey, ${name-player}.${prompt};Hey, ${name-player}, que faites-vous ici?${prompt}
Hey, ${name-player}, what are you doing here?${prompt};
...${name-player}?${prompt};Salutations, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt};Oh c'est vous, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Oh, it's you, ${name-player}.${prompt};${name-player}, vous êtes venu ici aussi ?${prompt}
${name-player}, you came here, too?${prompt};Bonjour, ${name-player}!${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}!${prompt};Hey, c’est ${name-player}!${prompt}
Hey, it's ${name-player}!${prompt};Oh, c’est ${name-player}.${prompt}
Oh, it's ${name-player}.${prompt};
Oh, hi, ${name-player}!${prompt};Salutations, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Greetings, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Hm? ${name-player}?${prompt};C’est un de tes amis ?${prompt}
This a friend of yours?${prompt};Ouais, parfois ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] et je pars à l’aventure ensemble. Alors quoi de neuf? Quelque chose me manque ?${prompt}
Yeah, sometimes ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] and I go on adventures together. So what's up? I miss something?${prompt};Bien-sur! ${name-player} et je suis toujours partant pour une aventure ensemble ! Hé, de quoi parliez-vous justement ??${prompt}
Of course! ${name-player} and I are always up for an adventure together! Hey, what were you guys just talking about?${prompt};Vous pourriez dire ça. Bref, de quoi vous parliez juste ?${prompt}
You might say that. Anyway, what were you just talking about?${prompt};${name-player} et je m’aventure occasionnellement ensemble. Étiez-vous en train de discuter de sujets importants ?${prompt}
${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?${prompt};Nous nous aventurons ensemble parfois. De quoi parliez-vous tout à l’heure ? Ça avait l’air sérieux...${prompt}
We adventure together sometimes. What were you two talking about just now? Sounded serious...${prompt};Oui, nous sommes un peu comme des partenaires d’aventurier. Ai-je participé à une discussion importante ?${prompt}
Yeah, we're sort of like adventuring partners. Did I butt in on an important discussion?${prompt};Oui, nous partons parfois à l’aventure ensemble. Quoi qu’il en soit, il se passe quelque chose ?${prompt}
Yes, we sometimes adventure together. Anyway, is something up?${prompt};Ouais ! Nous aimons partir à l’aventure ensemble ! Hé, de quoi parliez-vous il y a une seconde?${prompt}
Yeah! We like to go on adventures together! Hey, what were you guys talking about a second ago?${prompt};Oui, ${name-player} et je m’aventure occasionnellement ensemble. Bref, de quoi tu parlais juste ?${prompt}
Yes, ${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Anyway, what were you just talking about?${prompt};Eh oui, nous partons parfois à l’aventure ensemble ! Euh, de quoi tu parlais juste ?${prompt}
Yep, we sometimes go on adventures together! Um, what were you just talking about?${prompt};${name-player} et je m’aventure occasionnellement ensemble. Étiez-vous en train de discuter de sujets importants ?${prompt}
${name-player} and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?${prompt};${name-player} et je voyage occasionnellement ensemble. Il semblerait que j’ai interrompu votre conversation. Continuer.${prompt}
${name-player} and I occasionally journey together. It appears I interrupted your conversation. Carry on.${prompt};Eh bien, en fait, je suis un peu dans le pétrin. J’apprécierais que vous m’écoutiez également.${prompt}
Well, actually, I'm in a bit of a fix. I'd appreciate it if you could hear me out, too.${prompt};Perdre le tableau en plus d’être attaqué par des pirates ? C’est dur.${prompt}
Losing the painting on top of getting attacked by pirates? That's rough.${prompt};Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates et avez perdu le tableau ? Quelle malchance !${prompt}
You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? What bad luck!${prompt};Vous avez donc perdu le tableau au profit des pirates. Hm, ce n'est pas votre jour de chance.${prompt}
So you lost the painting to pirates. Hm, not your lucky day.${prompt};Je vois. Vous avez dû être déçu de perdre le tableau au profit des pirates.${prompt}
I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.${prompt};Des pirates ont attaqué votre navire et ont pris votre tableau ? Oh non!${prompt}
Pirates attacked your ship, and took your painting? Oh no!${prompt};Faire prendre le tableau par des pirates comme ça...
Having the painting taken by pirates like that...;Je ne peux pas imaginer à quel point vous avez dû ressentir de la frustration.${prompt}
I can't imagine how frustrated you must have felt.${prompt};Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates et avez perdu le tableau ? Ce n’est pas bon.${prompt}
You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? That's not good.${prompt};Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates et avez perdu le tableau ? Oh, c’est dommage !${prompt}
You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? Oh, that's too bad!${prompt};Vous avez donc perdu le tableau au profit des pirates. Dame Chance ne vous sourit pas.${prompt}
So you lost the painting to pirates. Lady Luck smiles upon you not.${prompt};Vous avez été attaqué par des pirates ? Et vous avez perdu le tableau ? Je suis vraiment désolé !${prompt}
You got attacked by pirates? And lost the painting? I'm sooo sorry!${prompt};Je vois. Vous avez dû être déçu de perdre le tableau au profit des pirates.${prompt}
I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.${prompt};Les pirates sont donc allés jusqu’à repérer votre tableau. Il semblerait que vous ayez choisi le mauvais jour pour partir en mer.${prompt}
So the pirates went so far as to single out your painting. It seems you chose the wrong day to be at sea.${prompt};Si ${name-player}'s ok, j'aimerais y aller ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt}
If ${name-player}'s okay with it, I'd like to go with ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt};Si ${name-player} ça ne me dérange pas, j'aimerais aussi aider!${prompt}
If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I'd also like to help!${prompt};Si ${name-player} ça ne me dérange pas, je suppose que je devrais rejoindre ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt}
If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I suppose I should join ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt};Je suppose que je devrais accompagner ${name-player} sur ${choice-player-gender}[son] voyage.${prompt}
I suppose I should accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey.${prompt};Je sais! Et si j'allais à Windurst avec ${name-player}?${prompt}
I know! How about I go to Windurst with ${name-player}?${prompt};Hé, et si j'allais à Windurst aussi ? Je suis sûr ${name-player} ça ne me dérangera pas.${prompt}
Hey, how about I go to Windurst, too? I'm sure ${name-player} won't mind.${prompt};Si ${name-player} ça ne me dérange pas, vous pensez que je pourrais venir aussi ?${prompt}
If ${name-player} doesn't mind, do you think I could come along, too?${prompt};Si ${name-player} ça ne me dérange pas, j'aimerais aussi venir avec moi!${prompt}
If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I'd like to come along, too!${prompt};Si ${name-player} ça ne me dérange pas, je suppose que je devrais rejoindre ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt}
If ${name-player} doesn't mind, I suppose I should join ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt};Je pense que je pourrais venir aussi, ${name-player}?${prompt}
Think I could come along too, ${name-player}?${prompt};Je suppose que je devrais accompagner ${name-player} sur ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] voyage.${prompt}
I suppose I should accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey.${prompt};Je peux accompagner ${name-player} sur ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] voyage ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] ça ne me dérangera pas.${prompt}
I can accompany ${name-player} on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] journey. ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] won't mind.${prompt};Attendez une minute. Puisque vous êtes deux maintenant, j’ai encore une chose que je me demande si vous pourriez faire pour moi.${prompt}
Wait a minute. Since there are two of you now, I've got one more thing I wonder if you could do for me.${prompt};Je veux que l’un d'entre vous me fasse gagner du temps pendant qu’Angelica refait le tableau.${prompt}
I want one of you to earn me time while Angelica is redoing the painting.${prompt};Que voulez-vous dire par là ?${prompt}
What do you mean by that?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que cela est censé signifier ?${prompt}
What's that supposed to mean?${prompt};Signification ?
Meaning?${prompt};Vous gagnez du temps, monsieur ? ${prompt}
Earning time, sir?${prompt};Que voulez-vous dire ?${prompt}
What do you mean?${prompt};Comment pouvons-nous procéder ?${prompt}
How do we do that?${prompt};Hum ? Que voulez-vous dire ?${prompt}
Hm? What do you mean?${prompt};Gagner du temps, hein ? Que veux-tu dire ?${prompt}
Earning time, eh? What do you mean?${prompt};Ça veut dire quoi exactement ?${prompt}
Meaning what, exactly?${prompt};Hein ? Gagner du temps ? ${prompt}
Huh? Earning time?${prompt};Vous gagnez du temps, monsieur ? ${prompt}
Earning time, sir?${prompt};Gagnez-vous du temps ? Voulez-vous développer ?${prompt}
Earn you time? Care to elaborate?${prompt};Je veux que vous apportez à cette vieille manivelle une boîte vide...${prompt}
I want you to bring that old crank an empty box...${prompt};Et je veux que vous lui disiez qu’il contient le tableau, mais qu’il ne peut pas l’ouvrir tant que vous ne le lui dites pas, parce que le tableau est si délicat, vous voyez ? ${prompt}
And I want you to tell him that it holds the painting, but that he can't open it until you say he can, because the painting is so delicate, you see?${prompt};Ce Scrooge croira que le tableau est dans la boîte, et nous aurons gagné suffisamment de temps pour obtenir le vrai !${prompt}
That scrooge'll believe that the painting is in the box, and we'll have earned enough time to get the real thing!${prompt};Quand Angelica aura fini le tableau, nous pourrons simplement l’échanger contre la boîte vide, et le vieil homme n’en saura rien !${prompt}
When Angelica finishes the painting, we can just exchange it for the empty box, and the old man will be none the wiser!${prompt};De cette façon, je n’aurai pas à lui dire que j’ai perdu le tableau...${prompt}
That way, I won't have to tell him I lost the painting...${prompt};...et je peux éviter la punition...${prompt}
...and I can avoid punishment...${prompt};Cependant, je ne peux pas le faire seul ! C’est exact! J’ai besoin de votre aide, courageux aventuriers !${prompt}
However, I can't do it alone! That's right! I need your help, brave adventurers!${prompt};Alors vous nous demandez de tromper un pauvre vieil homme ?${prompt}
So you're asking us to deceive a poor old man?${prompt};Vous avez beaucoup de culot en nous demandant de tromper un pauvre vieux !${prompt}
You've got a lot of nerve, asking us to deceive a poor old man!${prompt};Vous voulez qu’on trompe un vieil homme fragile, hein ?${prompt}
You want us to deceive a fragile old man, eh?${prompt};Vous voulez donc que nous trompions un homme âgé.${prompt}
So you want us to deceive an elderly man.${prompt};Vous voulez qu’on mente au vieil homme ?${prompt}
You want us to lie to the old man?${prompt};Tromper un pauvre vieil homme n’est tout simplement pas mon style...${prompt}
Deceiving a poor old man just isn't my style...${prompt};Alors vous voulez qu’on trompe un pauvre vieil homme ?${prompt}
So you want us to trick a poor old man?${prompt};Vous voulez dire que vous voulez que nous trompions un pauvre vieil homme !?${prompt}
You mean you want us to trick a poor old man!?${prompt};Hmph. Tromper un pauvre vieil homme...${prompt}
Hmph. Deceiving a poor old man...${prompt};Hein～ ? Vous voulez que nous trompions un pauvre vieil homme !${prompt}
Eh～? You want us to trick a poor old man!${prompt};Vous voulez donc que nous trompions un homme âgé.${prompt}

Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.${prompt};
To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.${prompt};
You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.${prompt};
We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.${prompt};
Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.${prompt};
The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.${prompt};
Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!${prompt};
Value is determined by the calculation of “points” and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the “smallest fish,” the person with the fewest points will win.${prompt};
During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!${prompt};
If you would like to submit an entry, please ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.${prompt};
The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest.;
You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.${prompt};
After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.${prompt};
To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.${prompt};
This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.${prompt};
After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.${prompt};
Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!${prompt};
The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.${prompt};
In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as a souvenir.${prompt};
You may only receive your award while the results are being announced, so be sure that you are here on time!${prompt};

I have to watch over this waypoint and whatnot, so come by anytime.;
I'll take you places you've never even dreamed of going, tee-hee!${prompt};

I'm, well, supposed to be doing neat investigamatory stuff and whatnot, you know? I don't...er...have the time to go make a report.${prompt};
I'm definitely not saying that because the milk here is just to die for or anything, okay? It does go down awful smooth, though.;
And I hear the wrinkly dried goods look terrible, but taste even better, tee-hee!${prompt};
I'm about to...um...make some important headway and stuff into the water crisis Adoulin's facing. No joke.${prompt};
Yeah...so tell him my hands are completely full right now.${prompt};
This continent has so many interesting fishes, don't you think? I clearly need to investigate this phenomanomonon.;
That is how you say it, right?${prompt};
The Adoulin islands are kind of like an island, but with lots of islands, right? But did you know that means there's lots of water around them!? No wonder we eat so many fish back home! Because fish live in water, tee-hee!${prompt};

Some treats from Adoulin? For me? Tee-hee, this is so wonderful! Nothing like some yum-yums from back home to keep me bright and chipper!${prompt};
Anastate wants a little bit of an update? Leave it so him to spoil all the fun.;

If you open the main menu and press the right arrow key, you'll come across an entry called “Help Desk.”${prompt};
Selecting that option and then clicking “Help Desk” again brings up a small list, of which one entry reads “I need help with the game controls.”${prompt};
There's a lot of specific examples that might help you out, so give it a look if you're unclear on something.${prompt};
I'll mark that person's location on your map to make finding them easier. Never forget how useful your map can be!${prompt};
Someplace special, hmm? Well, it wouldn't do for you to get lost along the way, so let me mark that spot on your map.${prompt};

“Home points” will probably turn out to be among your best companions. Make sure to examine one if you find it, so you can warp between them and cover large distances fast.${prompt};
You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called “home points” for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.${prompt};
There's some special crystal nodes known as “home points” that'll undoubtedly serve you well. Don't forget to interact with all that you find, as they can help you get to far away places.${prompt};

I advise you to put any unwanted goods up for sale at the auction house rather than be taken advantage of by the vendors here.${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Here you go.;
No. I want to hold onto them.${prompt};
The guild has all manner of wares for sale. Let me know if any pique your interest.${prompt};
Well, well, you bring me a most intriguing specimen. You must be quite the accomplished geomancer to have come across such materials and methods.${prompt};
And here I thought such techniques had been lost to the ages.${prompt};
Don't worry--I have no plans to bombard you with tales of how to cut the cloth, or how my ancestors toiled endless hours to craft even the slightest...${prompt};
Oops! Sorry about that. I'll get started right away, although it may take a short while before your piece is complete.${prompt};
Sorry to disappoint you, but your garments aren't ready yet.${prompt};
Here you are, my geomancer friend. Fine work, if I do say so myself.${prompt};
${name-player}!${prompt};
I got special permission from Ikhi to make the trip down here, and boy, are my legs tired!${prompt};
Ah, pardon me. The name's Sylvie. I am one of Zacariah's descendants.${prompt};
I understand that you're the one who crafted these beautiful garments.${prompt};
I am, and I consider it an honor to be able to work with such ancient, almost-forgotten weaving methods.${prompt};
The vibrant blue hue of the cloth...the bottomless depth of directional magic.${prompt};
From my apprenticeship to this very day, never have I set needle to pieces of cloth quite like these.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 0[2]} is blessed with the gravitas of nature.${prompt};
It also borrows from the power of elementals to harmonize the physical with the magical.${prompt};
And this piece is intended for you, Sylvie?${prompt};
Me? Oh, no. I would like ${name-player} to have it.${prompt};
Zacariah's will would never have been carried out if not for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt};
I can't think of anyone more suited to don this attire.${prompt};
Please, ${name-player}. Take it as a sign of my thanks.${prompt};
Then the matter is settled.${prompt};
Let the ${choice: 0}[senses/movements/fortitude/wildness/natural grace] of Sih Renaye embrace you.${prompt};
Feel the ${choice: 0}[scent/life/power/rhythm/warmth] of nature emanating from its azure cloth.${prompt};
I have completed all pieces of this geomantic attire, and will be more than willing to provide you with another should you lose the original.${prompt};
I can stitch together other materials for you...but I may or may not have the materials in stock.${prompt};
Inquire about materials for which piece?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Hood.;
Coat.;
Gloves.;

Gaiters.${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 0[2]} enables the wearer to understand all aspects of the natural cycle.${prompt};
As such, it improves the efficacy of geomantic incantations and bolsters the life essence in one's luopan.${prompt};
Should you be looking to further your command over natural forces, look no further than this pair of ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It aids the wearer in hindering ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] foes, ensuring that they are no longer threats.${prompt};
Being a geomancer is about harmonizing with nature, not subjugating it. As such, I highly recommend this pair of ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Furthermore, the wearer can turn a foe's very capabilities against them.${prompt};
The lifestream flows in all things, but this pair of ${item-singular: 0[2]} is designed to amplify the way it courses through the wearer.${prompt};
Let it guide you, and inspire you to reach even greater heights.${prompt};
I can certainly craft that for you, but I don't have the materials on hand.${prompt};
Three things should suffice: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};
I am led to understand that your skills rival those of the primal geomancer herself, and that you were able to ring her bell in a time of great need.${prompt};
Perhaps a more simple material would bring out the same effects, given that you are starting with a leg up.${prompt};
In that case, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} should be all I need to work my magic.${prompt};
Of course, if you have problems procuring what you need, then I will accept payment of ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}.${prompt};
That should be sufficient recompense for me finding the materials myself.${prompt};
