${choice: 0}[Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!];
It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
Why, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.${prompt};
Let me take a look...;
This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!${prompt};
I wish you speed upon your journey.${prompt};
You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.${prompt};
Come back when you have the requisite certification.${prompt};
Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.${prompt};
Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment?;
Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt};
The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt};
Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt};
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};
You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to ${number: 0} of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.${prompt};
In your case, we will render you with a total of ${number: 1} imprimaturs every ${number: 0} hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.${prompt};
One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.${prompt};
Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.${prompt};
The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.${prompt};
You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.${prompt};
There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: “coalition referendums.”${prompt};
The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.${prompt};
When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.${prompt};
A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.${prompt};
The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.${prompt};
I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.${prompt};
Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of ${number: 0} imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.${prompt};

Nothing.${prompt};
The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.${prompt};
It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.${prompt};
The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.${prompt};
The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.${prompt};
We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.${prompt};
The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.${prompt};
The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.${prompt};
We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.${prompt};
Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.${prompt};
The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.${prompt};
The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.${prompt};
Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.${prompt};
The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.${prompt};
We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.${prompt};
Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.${prompt};
The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.${prompt};
It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.${prompt};
Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number ${number: 1}.${prompt};

Behavioral research.;

Nothing.${prompt};
Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.${prompt};
It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.${prompt};
Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.${prompt};
The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.${prompt};
Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.${prompt};
If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.${prompt};
While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.${prompt};
Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.${prompt};
For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about “back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet,” from some wily veterans.${prompt};
Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.${prompt};
You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.${prompt};
By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.${prompt};
The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.${prompt};
Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.${prompt};
Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.${prompt};
The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.${prompt};
Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.${prompt};
The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.${prompt};
The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.${prompt};
While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.${prompt};
Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.${prompt};
This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.${prompt};
Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.${prompt};
The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!${prompt};
The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.${prompt};
Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.${prompt};
This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.${prompt};

Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya?;
You got nothin' on me, ${choice-player-gender}[man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.${prompt};
Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky!;
Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?${prompt};
I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.${prompt};
Now, listen close...${prompt};
Oh...;
Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.${prompt};

To think, our foe lies beyond this door...${prompt};
But Morimar and Darrcuiln aren't here yet.${prompt};
I wonder what's keeping them.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
We've got to go in.;
It's best to wait for them.${prompt};
${name-player}, remember how I made you promise not to go on without me? What would it say about me if we went behind his back and did the same thing?${prompt};
You're right. That's for the be--${prompt};
(${name-player}! Arciela!);
(You must not go any closer!);
Darrcuiln? What's wrong? Did something happen?${prompt};
What is--?${prompt};
(It is too late!);
My dear friends, have I startled you? Fear not. I have no intention of slinking in the shadows or vanishing before your very eyes.${prompt};
Come. Fate knocks but once.${prompt};
${name-player}! I can't control--!${prompt};
${name-player} and Arciela. How many moons has it been?${prompt};
I see that one of your ragtag entourage is conspicuously absent.${prompt};
No matter.${prompt};
Melvien!${prompt};
No man is born into this world without sin. We all have darkness in our hearts--yet some tuck it away better than others.${prompt};
Men are born into this world whole, but their spirits live on even as their bodies crumble into dust.${prompt};
They float through time and space--some days, some weeks, some centuries--until they are eventually given life again.${prompt};
Spirits never know release from their torment, all owing to the gloom that resides within each of us.${prompt};
And what do they carry with them as they revive anew?;
Nothing. They are ethereal strings, stretching from existence to pointless existence.${prompt};
Yet if we try to tie the ends together, to close the circle, we discover only that they extend farther than our hands can reach.${prompt};
What is the purpose of life if its inevitable destination is despair?${prompt};
I pity those lost souls who will never attain true awareness, and thus I have no choice but to snuff each lone candle out.${prompt};
And once that task is done, I will rebuild a new, more natural order.${prompt};
You mean to--!${prompt};
How is that evil? By bringing death, I create new life.${prompt};
And the only way to save a spirit is to annihilate it.${prompt};
Vana'diel is a fickle place.${prompt};
Despite your endless meandering, you occasionally give life to exceptional individuals. An “awakening.”${prompt};
Your much-lauded August was one such man. These anomalies across the ages are spiritual leaders, erudite sages, ferocious generals...and more.${prompt};
Perhaps you are the same. Perhaps not.${prompt};
Maybe you are a sign, sent to guide me on the right path. There are things that even someone with endless hosts like myself does not know.${prompt};
Will you be the ones to open the gates to paradise?${prompt};
“Gates to paradise”...?${prompt};
...Ha.;
Listen to me, bleating like a foal.${prompt};
You have come to stop me, have you not?${prompt};
August did the same.${prompt};
Do the lot of you not realize how absurd this is? Surely you cannot mean to succeed.${prompt};
If you know not your place, then I shall show you.${prompt};
Look upon me and despair!;
Despair at the futility of your struggle!${prompt};
Graaaaaaaaah!;
It would serve you better to put more weight into your blade than your war cries.${prompt};
Stop spittin' out filth and fight like a man!${prompt};
(Morimar, I tried to stop them from entering, but it was too late!)${prompt};
There's no way we can fight 'im like this!${prompt};
Darrcuiln, take ${name-player} and the princess and get outta here!${prompt};
(By your word!)${prompt};
But why!? With all of us here, surely we can--${prompt};
It's not about defendin' ta the last, Arciela! There's a reason fer--${prompt};
A fatal mistake to let your guard down, fool.;
Morimar!${prompt};
<Cough>;
Don't underestimate this old man, demon spawn!${prompt};
Hahaha! And old you are, indeed!${prompt};
Think yer clever, do ya?${prompt};
Maybe I'm not half the man I once was, but I've got wisdom now I didn't then!${prompt};
Don't pretend ta be all high and mighty with--${prompt};
Darrcuiln, ya gonna stand there agape, or get yer hide outta here like I asked!?${prompt};
Go! I can only protect ya for so long!${prompt};
And you two--I need ya to trust me on this one! Throwin' a bunch of words at ya as explanation isn't gonna help!${prompt};
Flee while you can! I've got a little someone taking care of things fer me!${prompt};
I should be able to hold out until ya haul yer butts outta here.${prompt};
Resist all you want, stubborn fool. I shall delight all the more once your spirit is finally broken!${prompt};
Wraaaaaahg!;
(Climb on!)${prompt};
But we can't--${prompt};
(I said on!)${prompt};
Hmph. I know your type, Morimar. You stand tall and true, knowing you have played your role in this charade.${prompt};
So the best way to get to you...;
...is by slaying your friends.${prompt};
Take a look.;
What action do you take?;
${selection-lines};
Protect Arciela.;
Block Hades's assault.${prompt};
(Un-un--)${prompt};
(Morimar, why?)${prompt};
Are yer ears stuffed with cotton!? Run while ya can!;
(And abandon you to this monster? No! Together we stand!)${prompt};
Don't run foolishly into death, Darrcuiln! I've taught ya all you need ta know--now get yer mangy hide outta here!${prompt};
Urk...ack!;
(Morimar!);
(What--);
F-fer once, would ya just listen!?${prompt};
A bit overconfident, throwing away your weapon, hmm?${prompt};
Don't you think?${prompt};
(Get away--!)${prompt};
Leave...now...!;
"Hmph. Stubborn...ta the last. Ya shouldn't be savin' your master; ya should be listenin' ta him!${prompt}";
Get 'em outta here!${prompt};
(!?);
${name-player}!${prompt};
What do you tell Arciela?;
${selection-lines};
We've got to leave it to him!;
We've got to stand strong!${prompt};
(${name-player}, you heard him! We have to escape before it is too late!)${prompt};
(Quick! Climb on!)${prompt};
But, we can't!${prompt};
(Princess, you heard him...if we do not leave now, then we all die!)${prompt};
(Take to me!)${prompt};
I-if you say so...${prompt};
As long as I'm keepin' him occupied ya should be able ta bust through the door!${prompt};
May the wind be at yer back, Darrcuiln!${prompt};
(Morimar...please, forgive us!);
How long do you plan on clinging to your pitiful existence?;
Gurk...${prompt};
Did someone show you how to resist me for so long? Tell me, Morimar--what have you learned?${prompt};
That's a good question. But what would I gain from tellin' ya? ${prompt};
Hmm...${prompt};
It matters little. You have been a thorn in my side for too long.;
Urf...ikft!${prompt};
I thought it was mere resilience...but I underestimated your resolve.${prompt};
What unworldly forces has the betrayer given you?;
Hahaha, survive you might, but your soul will never again know solace!${prompt};
...${prompt};
I will release you from such painful shackles, Morimar. Have you any last words you wish the ages to record?${prompt};
Ha! I've got no words for ya, other than these: the next generation will come for ya, no matter how much flesh ya flay from this old corpse!${prompt};
I'm glad I can sacrifice myself...just like August did...${prompt};
Incorrigible whelps. Know you not your place in this world?${prompt};
There is no saving those who wish for oblivion.${prompt};
Hades!${prompt};
Lady Arciela, what would your devotees do if they saw their adored “princess” looking so dour?${prompt};
It matters not. The downtrodden may call you what they will, but I'll not address you by that mockery of a title, nor feign respect for those trailing at your skirts.${prompt};
After all, you stand in my domain now.${prompt};
Congratulations on breaking the blood sigils. It's more than I'd expected.${prompt};
I'm eminently aware that the betrayer had a hand in this.${prompt};
A toast, then! To the success of our heroes!${prompt};
Ha! What do you think your little playtime bought you?${prompt};
A chance to stand on equal footing? Is that it?${prompt};
Perhaps I should pat you on the head like the simpletons you are.${prompt};
You've succeeded in accomplishing absolutely nothing.${prompt};
But it's pointless knowing that now, because in precious moments I'll be making trinkets out of your bones.${prompt};
For a man with an eternity to spend, I've very little patience.${prompt};
(Hades...;
What have you done with Morimar!?)${prompt};
What've I done? Oh, your mewling amuses me so.${prompt};
(I don't...)${prompt};
You want him back, don't you? Yet you can't say those four little words.${prompt};
(...)${prompt};
Hahaha! I've treated you a bit more beastly than you truly are. My apologies.${prompt};
What a faithful little pet, cowering about wanting his master's body returned.${prompt};
And what would you do with it? Climb a grassy knoll and bury it overlooking the ocean?${prompt};
Or would you leave the corpse in a dirty field for the vultures to gnaw at his flesh?${prompt};
Too bad for you, then, that neither will happen.${prompt};
You pitiful fools are dumb enough to believe that I'd leave so much as a shred of him left?${prompt};
I had expected even your pea-sized brains to know that much.${prompt};
Let's postulate for one minute. Even if I did let him leave with his life, what would he have done?${prompt};
Go scurrying back to his oh-so-faithful companions, weaving a grand tale of his daring escape.${prompt};
But that faint glimmer of hope you held out should have turned into despair.${prompt};
Because your master didn't come back, did he?${prompt};
(What have you done with him!?)${prompt};
Oho, I should've given you more credit. It's exactly as you think.${prompt};
His death throes were silenced by these two hands.${prompt};
He spewed to the last that he did it to save his friends and drew his last breath, alone, in a struggle that was anything but valiant.${prompt};
Do you know how hordes of rats spill out of the walls when a sturdy vessel careens over?${prompt};
This one got a bit stuck along the way. Where his friends found higher ground, he found only watery asphyxiation.${prompt};
Could you picture a more comical end?${prompt};
To have lived years--centuries!--only to die in ignominy.${prompt};
And what does he have to show for it?${prompt};
Protecting the jungle?${prompt};
Stopping August's bloodline from ending?${prompt};
He created nothing for himself, spending his miserable existence defending the works of others.${prompt};
Did his life hold any meaning?${prompt};
...No.${prompt};
He died for nothing!${prompt};
How laughably absurd.${prompt};
A man with no value in life finding no value in death.${prompt};
Garbage.${prompt};
The man was utter garbage!${prompt};
Arrrrrraaaaaaaaah!;
Oh, now that's a sight I haven't seen in ages.${prompt};
That shine...using your soul to fuel your rage!${prompt};
Grrrrrrrrr! Urrrrrr!;
<Roar>;
I was right the first time. Your mind speaks the tongue of man, but your vocalizations are those of a mere monstrosity.${prompt};
I seem to recall your master telling you something about not rushing in without thinking.;
But look at you--pathetic.;
Ugggh...;
The pain...it...;
Darrcuiln!?;
Why'd ya come back!?${prompt};
(!?);
Darrcuiln, don't--!;
Damned idiot...;
Ya put up a brave front, but all ya really wanted was ta be loved.;
And where's all yer trust in me?;
Hmph. Imagine that.;
(Grk! M-Morimar!?);
Didn't he tell ya? I died!;
Urk!;
You love your precious master so much...how fitting that you join him.;
N-no, it can't be...;
To first lose Morimar, and now Darrcuiln...${prompt};
Oh, my little “princess.”${wait-36: 2};
Do you really have the time to sit down, staring?${prompt};
Two down...${prompt};
...And two to go.${prompt};
It's high time you, too, fell into the abyss.${prompt};
Hades--your reign of terror ends here!;
Mrg...${prompt};
How could you possibly--!${prompt};
Are you--are you--!${prompt};
Are you capable of transcending...${prompt};
No. It can't be done.${prompt};
I refuse to believe it!${prompt};
I...am Hades!${prompt};
Ra'Kaznar is my dominion, its very existence proof that I have broken the cycle!${prompt};
And I have come to release all souls from wandering aimlessly in the dark!${prompt};
But it is not enough. Remnants of my human form continue to stand in my way.${prompt};
My sole means to success...${prompt};
Is by ridding myself of all vestiges of humanity!${prompt};
This vile husk restrains me...${prompt};
I must shed this skin and abandon the frailty of mankind!${prompt};
None shall remain!;
Yeeeeeeeees!;
Wh-what did he--!?${prompt};
Eeeeeek!;
...My wish.;
...Desire sole...;
...The end.;
What is he...? ${name-player}?;
Are the two of you safe?${prompt};
Teodor?${prompt};
Stand, Princess. Now is not the time to falter.${prompt};
Sajj'aka!${prompt};
I...cannot move!${prompt};
Does this face look familiar to you?${prompt};
All those years ago, I followed you...until I saw the light.${prompt};
It is me, Hades. Teodor.${prompt};
Never did I think to stand in front of your visage once more.${prompt};
I can only hope that my words will reach the bottom of whatever heart you may have left.${prompt};
In your misguided quest to banish the darkness, you became enthralled by that very thing you thought to destroy.${prompt};
Awaken from your nightmare!${prompt};
...Come...;
...Gather...;
...at my light...;
Teodor!${prompt};
It is as I feared.${prompt};
You no longer possess a single drop of self-awareness.${prompt};
I once pledged myself to you, and out of a sense of duty...${prompt};
I will give you the sweet release you always craved.${prompt};
The time is now, ${name-player}! Banish him to the depths beyond!${prompt};
A battle for the agesss!${prompt};
Sajj'aka!${prompt};
Do you mean to...?${prompt};
I cannot allow the dead to rot here.${prompt};
...No. Something is not right.${prompt};
...Torment...;
...Reverse...;
...Darkness...;
You have fallen so far... Can that even be called an existence?${prompt};
There is naught else to do.${prompt};
Teodor? What's happening!?${prompt};
Ortharsyne, it's--!${prompt};
<Motheeer...;
Bring your power to this land once more!>${unknown: 0x7F38C800};
<Cleanse it of all iiimpurity!>${unknown: 0x7F38C800};
<And let Orthaaarsyne shine bright...>${unknown: 0x7F38C800};
<Like the breath of the holy dragooon himself!>${unknown: 0x7F38C800};
Hades, he's...${prompt};
In death, a miracle...${prompt};
Rosulatia?${prompt};
August...?${prompt};
You mean--!? But that's impossible!${prompt};
Queen Rosulatia...${prompt};
<Without the aid of these gifteeed individuals, the World Tree would not have come to thrive once more.>${prompt};
<I can feel their spiriiits drifting about, sealed here along with the others within this domain.>${prompt};
<At least, for now...>${prompt};
<But this one here...not only has his spirit falleeen prey, but his body as well.>${prompt};
Then I shall intervene.${prompt};
Just as I called the noble one from the brink of death, so too shall I breathe new life into Darrcuiln.${prompt};
Be it salvation or curse, I know not.${prompt};
<The World Tree oooversees all life. Let me lend them but a fraction of her vitality.>${prompt};
<Motheeer, grant them your bounty, that they may find the strength to overcome.>${prompt};
Ugh... Mmmf...;
<Gasp>${prompt};
What on Vana'diel...${prompt};
I thought I had...${prompt};
Morimar! Darrcuiln!${prompt};
We're in...the turris?${prompt};
Oh, Morimar, please forgive us! If only we hadn't come in the first place, you would have...you would have...${prompt};
Huh? My head's filled with fog, Princess. You're gonna have to be a bit clearer.${prompt};
(I, too, am at a loss.)${prompt};
Finally have your eyes open? To think my own general would be caught napping...${prompt};
Wha...?;
A-August? Could it be...?${prompt};
Good Morimar, you have done Ulbuka a service these long years.${prompt};
And you, young cub, are the very image of your honored father.${prompt};
<King Auguuust...>${prompt};
Yes. None know better than I, Rosulatia.${prompt};
Our respite is but a brief one.${prompt};
Teodor, what's going on!?${prompt};
The gate connecting these two worlds is unstable. Tartarus threatens to consume this entire place.${prompt};
Then we'll get sucked in too!${prompt};
We had worked to seal the magic within, yet...${prompt};
My friends...my posterity, ere long this entire edifice will vanish. I bid you flee!${prompt};
Sajj'aka, take wing!${prompt};
As you command, My Liege!${prompt};
We are counting on you.${prompt};
B-but wait! What about the two of you!?${prompt};
Think not our lives forfeit. It will be yet another sacrifice to shelter Adoulin.${prompt};
People do not swear fealty to a king. A king swears fealty to his people.${prompt};
You don't have to do this alone!${prompt};
Dear child, you bring a smile to my face.${prompt};
But this task is not for you.${prompt};
Generations have passed since I last walked this land, yet I cannot count how many.${prompt};
And all those who served the nation in life...${prompt};
There is naught left in this world for me. My beloved wife has long departed this realm, and our scions have long since taken up their inheritance.${prompt};
King August, I...${prompt};
But your deep-green eyes and hair of purest silver... Our daughter looked much the same.${prompt};
It was with heavy heart I witnessed the years of trials faced by our nation. Yet seeing you this day has eased my burden.${prompt};
My name is Arciela.${prompt};
A beautiful name for a young woman so fair of face.${prompt};
You have an older brother--Ygnas, was it not? The man's stubbornness rivals my own.${prompt};
And lest you ask--yes, that was my doing.${prompt};
He is a scrappy one.;
And the curse that bound him is no more.${prompt};
His path is now his own to walk.${prompt};
And you, too, Arciela. May you find in your long lives the serenity that we did not.${prompt};
My knight most true, Ulbuka continues to need your service.${prompt};
I'd not have it any other way!${prompt};
Enough with royal fiats. Sajj'aka, your time is now.${prompt};
We shall not meet again in this time. Watch over my people, always.${prompt};
Yes, Your Majesty.${prompt};
Yggdrasil has shown us all you have done for this land.${prompt};
You have protected my descendants--nay, the entirety of my nation--and followed our call to this very spot.${prompt};
You leave miracles in your wake. Yggdrasil is reborn, Sajj'aka is whole, and by the grace of Altana you stand before us today.${prompt};
Your star shines brighter than any.${prompt};
Pray, tell me your name.${prompt};
How do you respond?;
${selection-lines};
${name-player}.;
I am but a humble ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman].${prompt};
${name-player}.${prompt};
And a good name it is. I will remember it, even in times of darkness.${prompt};
Hahaha! Those who choose not to leave their names in history are oft those who have moved it the most!${prompt};
The rest is up to us.${prompt};
Hades, the time for you to enter eternal slumber has arrived.${prompt};
And by my hands it ends.;
I compel you. Begone!;
Why...!${prompt};
Why do you intervene, old friend!?${prompt};
August, I cannot...${prompt};
Though I severed all ties with him and turned to you...;
...And no matter how much I loathe him, and shall continue to despise him for all time...${prompt};
...I cannot allow you to extinguish the small fire he awakened in my heart when first we met.${prompt};
I cannot...cannot...${prompt};
Please, August...;
Please allow me this one indulgence.${prompt};
I cannot allow him to remain!${prompt};
Then let me stay here...with him.${prompt};
Have you taken leave of your senses?${prompt};
No.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Then I shall respect your will. The centuries have done little to change you, old friend.${prompt};
But know this: so long as you decide to remain with me, I will have you fight by my side.${prompt};
That goes without saying.${prompt};
You remain ever a man of mystery, Teodor.${prompt};
Go. There is little time left.${prompt};
The two of us will be able to prevent a calamity from occurring, though it will take some time.${prompt};
<The two of you? There is aaanother who stands proudly with you.>${prompt};
Ah, Queen Rosulatia. Your aid would be a boon.${prompt};
We take our leave.${prompt};
Cling to my wings, seekers of Adoulin.${prompt};
And Your Majesty...I bid you farewell.${prompt};
May the ends of time bring us together once more.${prompt};
All those many years ago, we pledged that our deaths would serve a greater purpose. That oath takes form at last.${prompt};
Come, friends.${prompt};
