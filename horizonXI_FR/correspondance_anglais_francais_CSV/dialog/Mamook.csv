This place gives me the creeps. I should've practiced using teleportation magic on myself!${prompt};
This place is going to make me melt into a puddle. I bet if you were stuck in here, you could use magic and make a grand escape, but me...${prompt};
This place is going to freeze me into a block of sub-zero gelato. I bet you could warm yourself up with fire magic, but me...${prompt};
I don't know who you are, but you're the nicest person I ever met! Thank you!${prompt};
You saved me earlier! Thank you very much! You can have this...for free!;
As I was being dragged to this dreadful place, I noticed many questionable decorations about the area. I wonder if those are a type of charm against evil...${prompt};
As I sit in this cage and reflect, I feel the “true darkness” creeping ever closer... I must return to town at once.${prompt};
There's something foul in the air here. Can you not feel it? The “true darkness” is approaching.${prompt};
I give you my thanks, adventurer. I must now make haste back to town, where I can help ward off the darkness. We shall meet again.${prompt};
You saved me from my shadowy prison. Thank you. I have no wards against the darkness now, so I am afraid you must settle with this.;
This is terrible... How will the auction house in Al Zahbi ever function without me?${prompt};
This is awful... Who will take care of the auction house while I'm gone?${prompt};
This is horrible... I've still got the keys to the auction house in my pocket! Noone'll be able to get in without them!${prompt};
Thank you!;
Now I can go back to town and reopen the auction house!${prompt};
I was beginning to think the auction house was going to have to shut down for good...until you saved me. Please accept my thanks.;
This auction house is renowned for its low transaction fees, and the fact that it's connected to Jeuno makes it extremely convenient!${prompt};
I was sure I could overpower the beastmen, but they were just too strong... I must strive harder if I am to face my followers again.${prompt};
I was planning to build my strength from morning until night...but all my power turned out to be useless when I really needed it.${prompt};
You've fought the beastmen so many times they don't even make a scratch on you now, right?${prompt};
Thank you. I've realized now that I must train the mind as well as the body. I must return and share this revelation!${prompt};
Thank you for freeing me earlier.;
I have decided to train both my body and mind from now on. Please accept this as gratitude.;
See how hard my students are working? It brings me great pleasure each day to see how much they are growing under my guidance.${prompt};
I would be devastated if anything were to happen to Her Magnificence while I was confined! You must help me!${prompt};
The Serpent Generals are under my guidance, and all I can do is wile away the days as Her Magnificence remains unguarded!${prompt};
Who will protect the Empress while I am wiling away in this prison? Even perishing here would not absolve me if she is hurt!${prompt};
Praise be to you! I shall return now and ensure the Empress's safety. May she reign a thousand years!${prompt};
Her Magnificence the Empress is safely shielded now, and it is all thanks to your efforts. You have the makings of a hero.;
The mercenaries and the Imperial Army shall fight and perish as one to shield the Empress from harm!${prompt};
May Her Magnificence reign a thousand years!${prompt};
My presence was all for naught... My failure to protect the Astral Candescence is a transgression worthy of a thousand deaths...${prompt};
Hear my plea... You mercenaries may be all that I can trust. Recover the Astral Candescence and bring it safely back to Al Zahbi...I implore you!${prompt};
Ah, ${choice: 0}[/Private Second Class /Private First Class /Superior Private /Lance Corporal /Corporal /Sergeant /Sergeant Major /Chief Sergeant /Second Lieutenant /First Lieutenant /Captain ]${name-player}!;
It is reassuring indeed to have such a mighty ally to aid in the defense of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
I am honored to fight at your side in the name of Her Magnificence!${prompt};
Foul lizards, I damn you!;
Go ahead and bask in your victory. It shall be your last!${prompt};
Damn you foolish Trolls!;
When I get out of here, I shall bathe your dwellings in scarlet!${prompt};
You are not undead, are you?;
Release me from this prison now! I shall make ashes from those witches!${prompt};
...;
I shall not praise you for fulfilling your duty. I will take your name, though.${prompt};
${name-player}, is it?;
This should please you...;
You are a mercenary, are you?${prompt};
Hmph, filthy money-grubbers.;
Those who are controlled by money are eventually betrayed by it.${prompt};
Damn those spineless Imperial soldiers! How could they let the Astral Candescence slip out right under their very noses!?${prompt};
...Hm?;
You! Yes, you! What do you think you're staring at, anyway? Go get the Astral Candescence back, and now!${prompt};
Ugh, you again. I have no patience for the mercenary mentality.${prompt};
But you do show some skill in battle.;
I'll give you that much, ${name-player}...${prompt};
I'm going to be stuck in here forrrever... I'll never get out like this...${prompt};
What if they'rrre planning to drag me off to the headsman? I...I'm scared...${prompt};
My knees start to wobble at the mere thought of those eerrrie fish people... I can't even move...${prompt};
What do you want?;
I was just about to bust out of there myself!${prompt};
Oh, I rrremember you.;
Here, this is for you.;
I-I'm not thanking you for anything. Don't get the wrrrong idea. This is just to cover the costs of your journey.;
Leave me alone. I can't stand merrrcenaries.${prompt};
Just make sure you don't get in our way when we're rrripping up the battlefield.${prompt};
How am I going to get out of this...? The...the...Astral Candescence... What'll I tell the Empress...?${prompt};
...What!? I don't need you merrrcenaries' help. I could take the Astral Candescence back with both hands tied behind my back!${prompt};
Hmph, just because you think you know a thing or two about me now doesn't mean I like you.${prompt};
I am a generrral. You are a mercenary.;
Rrremember your station.${prompt};
Hey, lizard people!;
I'm going to start breaking things if I don't get some food in here soon!${prompt};
Damn, it's hot in here...;
Hey, pipsqueak! Yes, you! Get me out of here before I dry up like a date!${prompt};
I've still got life in my bones!;
Unlike you mindless corpses, I need sustenance to keep moving!${prompt};
Gahahaha! You were a living person after all! I can't believe that of all people, a mercenary saved my hide!${prompt};
Hey, you're the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who braved the beastmen to save me earlier, aren't you? Thank you! This is for you.;
When the beastmen invade, make sure you get behind us while we decimate the enemy. We wouldn't want you getting hurt now, would we?${prompt};
Gahahaha!${prompt};
Damn, we lost bad, didn't we? They even managed to take the Astral Candescence... But it's times like these...${prompt};
Gahahaha!;
...that we should laugh in the face of fate and take back what's ours!${prompt};
Oho, it's you!;
This battle will be over in time for lunch, then.;
I hate to miss a meal!${prompt};
Gahahaha!${prompt};
That scent... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!${prompt};
Those footsteps... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!${prompt};
The sound of breathing... You are a living being, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!${prompt};
Many thanks. I am Najelith of the Galeserpent--one of the five Serpent Generals. I owe my escape to you.${prompt};
Thanks to your heroic rescue, I was able to safely return to my post. I would like to show you my gratitude with this gift.;
We Serpent Generals will defend Al Zahbi with our lives.${prompt};
The mercenaries also have an important role in protecting the Empire. Do not forget that.${prompt};
The Astral Candescence is the Empress's treasure, the hope of our nation, and the bond between us...${prompt};
${name-player}... I must stay here for the capital's defense... So I beg of you, please recapture the Astral Candescence for Aht Urhgan!${prompt};
${name-player}, you are here to lend your strength to our defenses?${prompt};
Then let us drive back the beastmen, shoulder to shoulder!${prompt};

“Serpent Generals.”;
Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi.;
Astral Candescence with beastmen.;
Empire's current state of defense.${prompt};
“Sanction” is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.${prompt};
Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.${prompt};
When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.${prompt};
Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.${prompt};
But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.${prompt};
You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.${prompt};
You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting “Besieged” under “Region Info.”${prompt};
You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.${prompt};
“Besieged” occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.${prompt};
Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.${prompt};
The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the “Astral Candescence” from the Empire's control.${prompt};
You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.${prompt};
All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.${prompt};
The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders!;
Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.${prompt};
The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.${prompt};
Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.${prompt};
Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.${prompt};
If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.${prompt};
It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!${prompt};
When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.${prompt};
The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.${prompt};
There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.${prompt};
Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.${prompt};
Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.${prompt};
The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!${prompt};
If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!${prompt};
We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.${prompt};
As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set “archaic mirrors” in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.${prompt};
If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} them to an Imperial guard.${prompt};
Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in ${number: 4} ${choice-plurality: 4}[battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of ${number: 5}. The Imperial capital has seen ${number: 6} ${choice-plurality: 6}[victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of ${number: 7} ${choice-plurality: 7}[time/times].${prompt};
You do not possess the ${number: 1} ${choice-plurality: 1}[Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};

H-hey! Stop! Wait a minute!${prompt};
He wasn't a Mamool Ja... He was a person dressy-wessed up as a Mamool Ja!${prompt};
Come to thinky-wink of it, I did hear something about a liquid that will turn any who drinky-winks of it into the form of a resident of Mamook...${prompt};
But by the looky-wooks of him...;
Who are you, anyway?${prompt};
Are you the one who made mille feuille out of the guards?;
...Would you happy-wappen to be Duuruhn?${prompt};
No, you've got it all wrong! Please listen to what I have to say...${prompt};
Well, I am Duuruhn.${prompt};
And everything is my fault...${prompt};
Explain yourself!${prompt};
It all began with my doubts regarding the Imperial Army...${prompt};
Doubts?${prompt};
Yes... I was a soldier of the Imperial Army, but to be honest, I hated the way they did things.${prompt};
The army is supposed to protect the Empire's citizens and ensure the security of its land.${prompt};
But where are they when the beastmen invade Al Zahbi?${prompt};
They use the mercenaries and volunteer soldiers as fodder for the enemy as they watch the battle from afar!${prompt};
That's true. Empress Nashmeira receives a lot of crity-witicism for that.${prompt};
I did not want to be part of an army that serves the Empire only in name.${prompt};
Rather than continue my duties with such doubts running through my mind, I opted to desert and find my own path.${prompt};
However, I am still a soldier. I have sworn loyalty to the Empress and know the inner workings of the Empire. They would not simply allow me to quit...${prompt};
That's when I learned of Two Horn.${prompt};
Nobody knows who Two Horn is, so I used the rumors of his existence to disappear.${prompt};
So you decidey-wided to transform into a Mamool Ja until everyone forgot about you.${prompt};
Interesting. Not that baddy-wad of a plan.${prompt};
Please forget you ever saw me here.${prompt};
I beg you... Tell my officer that Two Horn didn't exist after all, and that my life was taken by the beastmen.${prompt};
Two Horn...doesn't exist?${prompt};
Hmph, that shows how little-wittle you know.${prompt};
Two Horn is standy-wanding right in front of you!${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
I heardy-weard that someone was using my name, so I came to find out who it was.${prompt};
So you've been causing all those incidents...?${prompt};
Heh heh. Surely ya can't expect us to keep count o' the number of people the boss 'as passed 'er merciless judgments on.${prompt};
The name “Two Horn” comes from 'er pigtails seen by 'er shudderin' victims as she leaves 'em in 'er wake.${prompt};
Hmph. That name isn't cutesy-wutesy at all!${prompt};
Everyone thinky-winks we're so heartless, we're so cruelly-wuel, whatever...but surely-wurely they jest. Of course we're not a bunch of thuggy-wugs! And if you even try to insinuate as much, I'll knocky-wock your face in!${prompt};
The Imperial Army is just as you said...a bunch of namby-pambies.${prompt};
I mean...what about the family-wamilies left behind when the beastmen attack?${prompt};
What about the childy-wildren who lose their fathy-wather in the battles?${prompt};
Who is going to takey-wake revenge for them? The Empire? Empress Nashmeira? No!${prompt};
Do you thinky-wink the powerless are going to get happiness from goldy-wold, laws, or stuffy-wuffy philosophies? No!${prompt};
Especially in Aht Urhgan!${prompt};
I'm just lendy-wending the poor and huddled masses a helping hand!${prompt};
Ya better not anger da boss.${prompt};
She's gonna continue cleanin' up da streets, ya know.${prompt};
Duuruhn, if you really-weally want to leave the army, we'll take care of you until this all setty-wettles down.${prompt};
R-really?${prompt};
Yeppy-weppers!;
${name-player}, I'll leavey-weave everything else to you. Go reporty-wort to the Imperial Army...or else, see?${prompt};
Maybe we'll meety-weet again somewhere.${prompt};

We must hurry!${prompt};
Ah, a mercenary. Just who I have been looking for.${prompt};
I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer me truthfully.${prompt};
Have you heard of Clavauert B Chanoix?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I read the Tribune.;
No. Reading is for wimps.${prompt};
Excellent, then I won't waste your time by giving you a history lesson.${prompt};
You've never heard of the baron? Where have you been the past few years, off in some virtual fantasy world?${prompt};
Clavauert B Chanoix is a famous zoologist from the Middle Lands.${prompt};
He is currently visiting the Imperial realm on an expedition researching the behavioral patterns of various animals native to this continent.${prompt};
The Empress has made it policy to officially sponsor the baron, and has ordered us to assist him in any way necessary.${prompt};
Her Excellence feels that not only will his research provide a treasure trove of valuable information on the Empire's ecosystem...${prompt};
...but also help us better defend ourselves.${prompt};
Why is that, you ask?${prompt};
Simply put, data on the monsters living in the area will aid us in determining the best plan of action to take when threatened by the foul fiends.${prompt};
In the past weeks, the baron has been focusing his research on the recently discovered Poroggo. He is currently planning a trip into Mamook to take a closer look at the new species.${prompt};
And that is where the Empire requires your help. We need someone to act as a bodyguard for Professor Chanoix while he collects his data.${prompt};
You need worry not. A hefty reward will be provided for your services, in addition to the fame and glory you will receive by accepting such an important mission.${prompt};
Well, what is your answer, mercenary?${prompt};
Accept the job?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not now.${prompt};
Understood. However, if you have a change of heart, the position will remain open until we find another volunteer.${prompt};
Wonderful. I will contact the baron right awa--${prompt};
Ah!${prompt};
Maudaal. Have you not yet found me a bodyguard? I do grow weary of these gray walls and long to step back out into the wild woods of Wajaom.${prompt};
Baron Chanoix! Your timing is impeccable!${prompt};
This fine citizen has just volunteered for the position.${prompt};
Excellent! Now I can finally continue my research.${prompt};
First, let me inform you of the focal point of this expedition.${prompt};
Are you familiar with the peculiar beastman known as the Poroggo?${prompt};
Are you?;
${selection-lines};
I'm an expert!;
Prego?${prompt};
Is that so? You adventurers never cease to amaze me with your knowledge of the world.${prompt};
You mean to tell me that you have no prior knowledge of the Poroggo?${prompt};
And you believe that this uneducated commoner will be able to effectively assist me in my research?${prompt};
Well, that is of no matter. At least you were honest about your ignorance--unlike my friend Maudaal here...${prompt};
Now listen carefully, as I shall give you a quick overview of the data I have collected thus far.${prompt};
You had best write this down!${prompt};
Yes, I first came across the creatures when excavating a stratum of soil deep beneath Windurst Waters. In a layer we estimated to be nearly a hundred years old, my team discovered a large quantity of strangely shaped bones.${prompt};
At first glance, they resembled the remains of large toads. However...${prompt};
Measurements of the skulls showed us that the creatures had exceptionally large brains.${prompt};
But that was not all--the forelegs seemed to be developed to the point that they might be used to grasp objects...${prompt};
Whereas the hind legs seemed more suited for walking than the traditional jumping one might expect from an amphibious land dweller.${prompt};
That was when I realized that we had not found the bones of a common toad, but a completely new and unique species!;
I can sense what you are thinking...${prompt};
It was as if we had discovered something directly from the pages of the well-known fairy tale, “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt};
And it is indeed from the famous frog princess, Poroggo, that we took the name for our new beastman.${prompt};
My theory was that over millions of years, the toads of Sarutabaruta adapted to their surroundings and evolved into this higher life form.${prompt};
However!;
I immediately took my findings to the Board of Akademia in Jeuno, but the fools simply laughed at me!${prompt};
Yes, it is true, I had no explanation for the discovery of “unevolved” toad bones near those of the Poroggo...${prompt};
But I knew that there had to be evidence that remained yet uncovered.${prompt};
There had to be a “missing link” that would prove my theory!${prompt};
And then, one day while poring over some of the Optistery's more sensitive tomes, I came across a most intriguing passage.${prompt};
It said that...${prompt};
...the Poroggo we found in Windurst Waters...${prompt};
...they were actually toads transformed into hideous creatures by the forbidden magicks of an eccentric mage named Samariri!${prompt};
It was difficult to accept that my original theory was incorrect.${prompt};
However, as a scientist, it was the only choice with which I was left.${prompt};
After my failure in Sarutabaruta, I felt I needed to put some distance between myself and the Middle Lands.${prompt};
And that is when I decided to pack up my equipment and ventured forth here, to Aradjiah, in search of new knowledge.${prompt};
And until recently, I have kept myself quietly busy with studies of the colibri and the chigoe.${prompt};
That is until I received word of a Poroggo sighting in the Mamool Ja Savagelands!${prompt};
According to the ancient tome I found in Windurst, all the Poroggo were exterminated by the Federation's mages immediately after their “accidental” creation. Though, ever since I discovered a peculiar footprint near the bungalow of my acquaintance, Pabool Ja, I have begun to believe otherwise.${prompt};
Recently, there have even been adventurer reports of toadlike creatures residing in the damper areas of the Mamool Ja stronghold.${prompt};
What I would like to find out is where these beastmen came from.${prompt};
Are they descendants of the Poroggo spawned from the spellweaving of some spoiled Tarutaru?${prompt};
Or, are they a completely different species, evolved from mere toads as stated in my original theory?${prompt};
And! How are they able to transform their unexpecting victims into frogs?${prompt};
The only way to come to satisfactory scientific conclusions is through research!${prompt};
And research requires time!!${prompt};
And so I planned an expedition into the savagelands to search out the elusive Poroggos and witness firsthand the instant a victim falls prey to their unique ${color: 5}frog song${color: 1}.${prompt};
But before I could set out on this trip, I required a volunteer...${prompt};
...to be that victim!${prompt};
Ah, I'm sorry if I alarmed you. Your services will only be required to fend off...unwanted guests.${prompt};
The noble Salwa-Molwa will be our guinea...er...toad.${prompt};
So this is our mighty mercenary? Looks a bit scrawny, if you ask me.${prompt};
I'm Salwa-Molwa.${prompt};
I'll be helping the professor out with his experiment.${prompt};
All you have to do is keep us alive while we're collecting the dataru.${prompt};
Think you can handle that?${prompt};
Salwa!${prompt};
Mikilulu!? What are you doing here?${prompt};
Are you really thinking about going through with this crazy scheme? What if you become a frog forever!?${prompt};
What are you worried about, baby? I've got the baron to protect me...and this mercenary, too. They'll help me out of any jam.${prompt};
How am I supposed to trust a so-called professor who would think of doing experiments on living, breathing Tarutaru!?${prompt};
Hey! Watch your mouth in front of the big B!${prompt};
Professor Chanoix is a respected member of society. Do you think he'd do anything to harm his fellow man?${prompt};
And think of this mercenary's feelings!${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[He/She] looks like ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] hasn't had any decent work for months. You wouldn't want to ruin this for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] now, would you?${prompt};
And what about my feelings!? Are you saying that I'm too weak to find a way to break a measly frog curse on my own? Well, bring it on, I say!${prompt};
If you'd like to know, I've been spending the last eight days practicing on how to act once I'm transformed. So there!${prompt};
Ribbit, ribbit, baby!${prompt};
Huh!?${prompt};
How is practicing to be a frog going to help you return to normal!?${prompt};
It's... Uh... Um... What do you know, anyway!?${prompt};
You see, the real reason I'm doing this is for the green! The gil, baby!${prompt};
I don't care about any money!${prompt};
Can't you see I'm just worried about your safety!?${prompt};
Pshhh. Whatever.;
Now scram, sweetcheeks. We men've got important business to attend to.${prompt};
Ugh! I don't know why I put up with you!${prompt};
But let me just say one thing before I go...${prompt};
If you come back a frog...${prompt};
...you won't be getting any more sugar from this candy cane!${prompt};
What's with her?${prompt};
I was kind of hoping that if I was stuck as a frog, she'd kiss me and I'd magically transform back to normal...just like in that fairy tale.${prompt};
<Grumble, grumble>...${prompt};
Ah! Oh! A thousand apologies, Professor Chanoix!${prompt};
Mikilulu obviously cannot fathom the importance of your research (or the reward that accompanies it).${prompt};
You don't need to worry, sir! I'm still your loyal servant!${prompt};
Though I'm unworthy to even kneel in the light of your zoological greatness...${prompt};
...I'll be the best guinea toad you've ever worked with!${prompt};
That's the spirit, Salwa-Molwa! I'm counting on you!${prompt};
Now, as for our rendezvous point. Are you familiar with the secret exit to the Wajaom Woodlands?${prompt};
I shall be waiting there for the both of you.${prompt};
And do not be late!${prompt};
Hey, mercenary-${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady], I know you probably took this job for the reward, but I'd like to ask you...${prompt};
Do you think there's anything in this world more important than money?${prompt};
Well do you?;
${selection-lines};
Yeah. Puppies are pretty nice.;
No. Even puppies pale to money.${prompt};
You see...;
When this job's over, I'm going to ask my sweetheart Mikilulu to marry me.${prompt};
That's why I'm going through with this. I'm not doing it for the money like I said.${prompt};
It's just, I can't tell Mikilulu that yet.${prompt};
Getting married is a serious thing, but I don't think I'm ready yet. I'm still the same, weak boy that got his butt kicked on the Ballista courts back at boarding school.${prompt};
Before I even try to prove to Miki that I can protect her, I have to prove to myself that I can.${prompt};
See? I know what I'm doing! I just wish Miki understood as well...${prompt};
I mean, I can see why she is worried and all, but I didn't think she would be so unreasonable!${prompt};
I guess I could sit her down and explain everything, but then she'd just get all teary-eyed like she always does...${prompt};
Oh, sorry about that.${prompt};
I didn't mean to put any extra pressure on you or anything. (Though, Miki would be devastated if anything were to happen to me on this mission...)${prompt};
Anyway, Miki's happiness is riding on my performance here.${prompt};
And if I have to become a frog thirty times over to prove my love to her, then so be it!${prompt};
Once you've made your preparations, you know where to meet me and the B.${prompt};
See you around!${prompt};
Ah, quite punctual of you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
“As swift as a raptor,” one might say.${prompt};
I should expect nothing less from a seasoned mercenary like yourself.${prompt};
Now, if only all my help were as competent...${prompt};
Where on Vana'diel could that nimwit be!?${prompt};
You're late, ${name-player}! “As laggard as a wamouracampa,” one might say.${prompt};
And you call yourself a mercenary... It is a wonder the Empire can thrive when protected by such a pitiful army of skivers.${prompt};
If you were working with my research team, you'd be fired before you stepped in the door. Why, you even make that assistant of mine, Atelloune, look like the Goddess Herself!${prompt};
And it seems your tendency towards tardiness is not necessarily a unique trait...${prompt};
Late! Late! Late!;
I'm gonna be lataru!;
Ulp! You guys haven't been waiting too long for me, I hope.${prompt};
Ahem!;
I apologize deeply for my delayed arrival, and humbly beg your forgiveness.${prompt};
Salwa the Unworthy, at your service.${prompt};
I would've been here earlier, but I thought we were supposed to meet at the exit to Bhaflau!;
Fool!${prompt};
How many times have I told you, I am not a man to be kept waiting!${prompt};
Or perhaps you thought we were going on a picnic to the countryside?${prompt};
Look at this fine mercenary, all ready to embark on our important mission. At least one of you has some sense of responsibility.${prompt};
Do not forget, Salwa-Molwa, there are thousands more Tarutaru where you came from. I'm sure I can find another to assist me!${prompt};
I-I'm sorry, Your Professorship! Please forgive me! It won't happen again!${prompt};
You are lucky I don't bend you across my knee and give you a good flogging! Maybe that would teach you a lesson!${prompt};
I seriously worry about the success of my research...${prompt};
But enough of this idle chit-chat. I guess there is only one way to see if you have truly learned your lesson.${prompt};
${name-player}. Am I safe to assume that you are familiar with the quickest route to Mamo--?;
<Yawn>...${prompt};
What sort of enchantment is this?${prompt};
Hm? Where is our little friend!?${prompt};
${name-player}! And you call yourself a bodyguard! It has been less than an hour and you have already succeeded in losing one of my team!${prompt};
Luckily it was just Salwa, but what if it had been me!?${prompt};
While I do not like the idea of losing precious research time...${prompt};
...I suppose we should locate the lost chap.${prompt};
However, I haven't the slightest of ideas where to begin searching.${prompt};
What about you? Did you happen to see anything while you were lounging there on the leaves?${prompt};
I thought I saw...;
${selection-lines};
A toad chasing a Poroggo!;
A Tarutaru chasing a toad!;
A Tarutaru chasing a Poroggo!${prompt};
Amazing!;
You say you saw an actual Poroggo!?${prompt};
Let me see... Then we can assume the toad you saw chasing after it would be none other than Salwa-Molwa!${prompt};
......;
How dare he go and transform without allowing me time to make my observations! If he is still expecting pay in full for this debacle, then he is gravely mistaken!${prompt};
!?;
You say you witnessed a Tarutaru chasing a toad?${prompt};
We can assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world has he chosen to run off and leave us here?${prompt};
Perhaps the toad placed a powerful charm spell on him... But why would it do that?${prompt};
No... I believe this is the scheming of a Poroggo.${prompt};
You must have simply mistaken the beastman for a common toad--an oversight easily understandable, coming from an uneducated lay${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] such as yourself.${prompt};
What is this!?;
You say you witnessed a Tarutaru pursuing a Poroggo!?${prompt};
We can safely assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world would he be chasing away the very beastman we seek?${prompt};
There is also the possibility that he was put under a powerful charm spell... But if that is indeed the case, why wasn't he transformed into a toad as well...?${prompt};
Either way, it seems best if we continue our expedition as planned.${prompt};
If a Poroggo truly was involved in Salwa's disappearance, then we shall find both of them in Mamook.${prompt};
My data tells us that the Poroggo mating grounds lie in an area accessible from an entrance located on the western side of this forest.${prompt};
Now let us make haste.${prompt};
<Sigh>...;
Perhaps this encounter with the Poroggo is a blessing in disguise.${prompt};
However, if that is the case, why did they kidnap that useless Salwa?${prompt};
Hm!?;
This whole situation is quite similar to that old fairy tale...${prompt};
I'm sure you have heard of it: “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt};
One day, a young Tarutaru is in the forest collecting toadstools when the frog princess, Poroggo, falls in love with the poor boy and carries him away to her underwater kingdom.${prompt};
Though Salwa-Molwa is not exactly what you could call “young,” I can't imagine anyone, even an amphibian, taking a fancy in that numbskull.${prompt};
Oh, do not misunderstand me, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I'm not saying that this fairy tale has any basis in truth.${prompt};
The act of mixing fact with fiction has no place in the world of science.${prompt};
Truth can only be defined as what we can see with our own eyes, grasp with our own hands.${prompt};
There must be a logical explanation for what happened to Salwa.${prompt};
It is just that we have yet to determine it.${prompt};
Now, off to Mamook!${prompt};
Pro～fe～sso～r!;
Hm!?;
Mikilulu! She's-- I've-- It's-- We've-- Toad!${prompt};
Well, if it isn't Salwa-Molwa...${prompt};
${name-player} and I were just about to set off in search of you.${prompt};
However, it seems that you, in turn, have found us. All's well that ends well, I suppose.${prompt};
Now, why don't you calm down and explain to us what has befallen you...starting with that unfortunate occurrence in Wajaom.${prompt};
You see, you two were still sleeping when I recovered from the spell. I looked around to see if I couldn't spot the fiend that had put us in this predicament...${prompt};
...when I saw my precious Mikilulu...${prompt};
...being turned into a frog!${prompt};
I tried to catch her so you could help break the curse, but for some reason, she started hopping off in the direction of Mamook!;
I knew ${name-player} would take care of you, Professor, so I left you two there in the woods to chase after Miki.;
So it was just as you explained, ${name-player}.${prompt};
(You must have the eyes of a pugil, ${name-player}. His account of the events is absolutely nothing like what you claim to have seen!)${prompt};
Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.${prompt};
And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...${prompt};
...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!${prompt};
And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!;
Hmmm... An interesting story...${prompt};
Though one aspect of the tale makes little sense--what was this female acquaintance of yours doing in the Wajaom Woodlands in the first place?${prompt};
I don't know. She didn't tell me...;
I can only guess it was because she was worried about the experiment.${prompt};
Oh! Why did it have to be Miki!? I was the one that was supposed to be transformed!${prompt};
How scared she must be...${prompt};
Calm down, calm down. Now, tell us what happened next.${prompt};
Well, after what seemed like hours of chasing, the Poroggo finally ducked away into this cave...${prompt};
...and that's when I lost him...${prompt};
I thought about searching for the frogman myself, but this place is crawling with hungry-looking Mamool Ja, and I wasn't planning on being a snack for those snakes.${prompt};
Understood.;
We are left with no other choice than to locate and rescue this Mikilulu.${prompt};
But how, Professor?${prompt};
My recent studies of Poroggo behavior have led me to the following conclusions regarding the removal of their curses.${prompt};
The first is that the effects of the frog song will simply wear off after time.${prompt};
If we can catch your lady friend, then we need simply wait in a safe location until she returns to normal.${prompt};
The second of my conclusions is a tad more dramatic.${prompt};
In theory, the spell of the frog song can also be broken...${prompt};
...by slaying its caster.${prompt};
While I hope it will not come to this, we may be forced to resort to violence if the Poroggo in question is not as cooperative as we may like.${prompt};
Now, I am a man of science. I could never resort to killing a fellow living creature. That is where you come in, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Now, as for distinguishing 'your' toad from a more common specimen...${prompt};
Professor! I think I can tell which one is my Miki!${prompt};
I mean, I did chase her through the forest for almost an hour.${prompt};
But even so, I'd know my own fiancee anywhere--frog or not!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
While I do not question your feelings towards Mikilulu...${prompt};
...I am wary of basing our search efforts on the memory of a Tarutaru who cannot even remember at which gate he is to convene.${prompt};
If only there were another, more reliable method...${prompt};
And what do we have here!?;
Toadprints! And quite fresh, by my calculations.${prompt};
Salwa, my boy. Have you seen any other toads in the vicinity since arriving?${prompt};
I-- No... I haven't!${prompt};
Then by process of elimination, we can deduce that the prints here belong to none other than Mikilulu!${prompt};
Whoa!;
I guess that's why they call you “Professor”!${prompt};
But...;
This place is huge. Where do we start looking?${prompt};
You need not worry, son. Poroggo are an amphibious species, meaning they cannot survive long out of water.${prompt};
To the west of our current location lies a small lake that is rumored to be one of their breeding grounds. We shall first try our luck there.${prompt};
And if anything attempts to attack us, I am sure our trusty mercenary here will handle it.${prompt};
Another toadprint!;
And exactly the same shape as the last! I feel we are getting close...${prompt};
And here is another!${prompt};
But this one is considerably larger... No doubt from the Poroggo that abducted the poor Mikilulu. This suggests that they are still traveling together.${prompt};
I found her!!!;
I do not see any Poroggo in the area.;
Hurry! We must capture her while she is alone!${prompt};
Let me make sure her print is the same as the one at the entrance.${prompt};
Yes... A perfect match!${prompt};
Yes!;
Mikimiki! Why did you go and run away from your Salwa? You don't know how worried I was!${prompt};
So, Professor. Now all we have to do is wait for the spell to wear off naturally, right?${prompt};
Correct. Though, I highly recommend we do so at a location safer than this.${prompt};
Look out!;
Ugh!;
Hmmm... Just as I had feared.${prompt};
Wait! Come back here, you stinky, slimy frogman!;
Stop!${prompt};
Gwahhh!${prompt};
I--I don't think I can handle this guy by myself... He's all yours, ${name-player}!;
Save my Mikilulu!;
You did it! Now Miki will...${prompt};
What the...?${prompt};
I do not understand... The spell should have been broken the instant the caster became incapacitated.${prompt};
Does this mean...we killed the wrong one!?;
Hmmm...;
The print is the same as the one we saw near Mikilulu's.${prompt};
I also believe I witnessed your lady friend respond to one of the Poroggo's commands during the battle.${prompt};
Finally, you can see that the subject has calmed down quite considerably since her captor's defeat.${prompt};
Then if this is really Miki, and that is really the culprit, then why is she still a toad!?${prompt};
That, my boy, I cannot say. My data has never failed me before...${prompt};
But... But...${prompt};
But what about waiting for the spell to wear off? You said that would work, right?${prompt};
Yes, and I also said that slaying the caster would break the curse...${prompt};
Eh!?${prompt};
Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt};
First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.${prompt};
This reaction continues until the whole body is affected, thus reducing him or her to the shape of the assailant.${prompt};
The concept is much similar to that behind the strange liquid medium that transforms its consumer into the shape of a Mamool Ja.${prompt};
Now, whether the sound waves of the frog song actually carry the medium...${prompt};
...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.${prompt};
That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt};
As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt};
We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt};
I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt};
By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt};
The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.${prompt};
To put it in layman's terms...${prompt};
To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt};
In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt};
In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt};
And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt};
However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt};
Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt};
Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt};
The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt};
Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt};
While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt};
Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt};
For example, if a large portion of Mikilulu's conscious had been dedicated to thinking of, and or, worrying about toads, then her mind may have become dependant on the Poroggo's signal and thus began reproducing it out of necessity when the original signal stopped.${prompt};
Eh!?${prompt};
In any case, finding a cure will require months, maybe years of new research.${prompt};
I am sorry, Salwa, but you shall just have to wait until then to reunite with your lady friend.${prompt};
...${prompt};
But you need not fear, my friend, for I shall dedicate myself to finding a solution to this predicament.${prompt};
You have my word as a scientist!${prompt};
P-Professor! Let me help you!${prompt};
I'll do anything!;
I mean, I don't know much about zoology, but there's got to be something I can do!${prompt};
Hmmm...;
I conduct a very strict program. I require the utmost in discipline from my assistants.${prompt};
Discipline is my middle name! I won't let you down!${prompt};
But can I trust you...?${prompt};
Alright. You may temporarily join my research team.${prompt};
T-Thanks B! I...uh, mean, thank you very much, Your Professing Greatness.${prompt};
Now we must hurry back to Al Zahbi and begin conducting tests. Move along, young man! We have little time to waste!${prompt};
Ah, and if I do recall, you have a slight problem with punctuality.${prompt};
That is why I will require you to take up residency in my laboratory's supplies room. Do you have any objections?${prompt};
N-none at all, sir!${prompt};
Alright, Miki. Let's go back to the kind professor's lab, where I'll build you a nice, big cage with grass and rocks and...${prompt};
Oh, and I bet you'll be wanting to take a swim every now and then.${prompt};
Well, you don't have to worry about that. Just croak and I'll dig you your very own swamp, with lily pads and everything!${prompt};
And food! I'll get you whatever you're craving for! What are you craving for? Worms? No, wait moles like worms... What do toads like again? Bugs! That's right!${prompt};
If it's bugs you want, bugs you'll get! I've got a Mog Locker full of shell bugs from that last time I tried to grow some ore.${prompt};
...${prompt};
That's right, Miki. I'll be right by your side until the big B can find a way to turn you back to normal.${prompt};
And then...${prompt};
We can get married and live happily ever after!${prompt};
M-Mikilulu!${prompt};
Amazing!${prompt};
That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.${prompt};
You... You understood what I was saying the whole time?${prompt};
No, not the whole time.${prompt};
But for some reason, those last few words of yours rang out in my head...${prompt};
...and before I knew it, I was back to my old self!${prompt};
Wow... So, all this time you were a frog, you were still thinking of me?${prompt};
I'm sorry, Mikilulu. This is all my fault. If I hadn't made you worry about me being transmutrified into a toad, you wouldn't have had to go through all this.${prompt};
But never again! From now on, I'll protect you from anything that stands in the way of our love...${prompt};
Salwa...${prompt};
...as soon as I finish this job for Professor Clavauert!${prompt};
Your services are no longer required, Salwa-Molwa.${prompt};
Eh? You're not going through with the experiment? But what about your research? What about my paycheck!?${prompt};
What are you talking about? The experiment was a success.${prompt};
Let me sum up my theory for you.${prompt};
Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt};
This ultimately proves that the duration of the frog song depends less on the potency of the Poroggo's cant, and more on the victim's psychological state.${prompt};
And because we now know that the victim's mind is capable of mimicking the Poroggo inhibitor signal...${prompt};
...we can conclude that the song is merely a catalyst, and it is the victim himself that maintains the actual transmogrification.${prompt};
However, we cannot ignore previous data showing symptoms of the toad curse vanishing upon the death of the caster.${prompt};
Therefore, I shall reconstruct my original theories and continue my research to discover a connection between Poroggo neural activity and transmogrification duration.${prompt};
This expedition has spawned more questions than it has answered, but I did learn one thing...${prompt};
...that the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!${prompt};
If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!${prompt};
However, this hypothesis requires much more research before it can be proven. I have much work ahead of me...${prompt};
And... Um... So does this mean I still get my paycheck...?${prompt};
<Sigh>;
Of course it does. And I shall even throw in something extra for Mikilulu's part in all this. Come by my office tomorrow morning at nine o-clock sharp...and do not be late!${prompt};
Th-thank you!${prompt};
Ah yes, and I suppose you'll be wanting your reward as well. I have entrusted your payment with Maudaal in Whitegate. Speak with him when you return to the city.${prompt};
Now let us be off!${prompt};
I had my doubts, but I must say, Maudaal, you are a fine judge of character.${prompt};
This mercenary performed exceptionally on our expedition. I thank you once again.${prompt};
I shall speak personally with your captain and inform her of your accomplishments.${prompt};
Thank you, Professor. That is not necessary.${prompt};
And now, for your “paycheck.”${prompt};
You have earned it, my little friend.${prompt};
Alright!${prompt};
See, Miki! I scored us all this gil!${prompt};
“You” earned us all that gil? Who's the one that was turned into a toad!? That purse of coins should have my name on it!${prompt};
Wait a minute, you've got this all wrong.${prompt};
If it wasn't for me mustering up the bravery to go on the mission in the first place, you wouldn't have followed me into the forest at all!${prompt};
That's right! It's ALL your fault that I was transformed!${prompt};
Hmph!;
You haven't changed a bit!${prompt};
B-But... I... I...;
I'm sorry, Miki...${prompt};
Calm down, Salwa.;
While I am a scientist, I cannot help but believe that fate played a role in all this.${prompt};
Out of passion for my research, I called upon two companions to accompany me to Mamook.${prompt};
Out of love for his soon-to-be better half, Salwa-Molwa chose to embark on this dangerous mission...${prompt};
...as did ${name-player}, whose endless yearnings for adventure brought ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to my side.${prompt};
And finally, you--it was your feelings for Salwa-Molwa that drove you to follow us.${prompt};
It was not until after misfortune had befallen Mikilulu that Salwa-Molwa realized how much he truly cared about her.${prompt};
And it was not until this realization of Salwa's that Mikilulu truly understood what lies deep within his heart.${prompt};
And!;
If it were not for this quaint melodrama, I would still be years behind in my research of the Poroggo, and ${name-player} would probably still be out collecting bat wings.${prompt};
Yes, fate has led us to our proper destinations! (Though, if I had not hired you two in the first place...)${prompt};
Ahem!;
Still, I still cannot comprehend what the Poroggo was thinking when it cast that terrible curse on poor Mikilulu.${prompt};
That's easy, Professor! It was love at first sight!${prompt};
It's the only explanation!${prompt};
You see, even without Miki's toadprints, I was positive I could tell her apart from the other frogs.${prompt};
Why? Because the most beautiful Tarutaru in the world would have to be the most beautiful toad in the world. And only a toad that beautiful would be worthy enough to play the part of Princess Poroggo!${prompt};
Princess Poroggo!? You've got to be kidding!${prompt};
While everything did not quite proceed as planned, I must say, this was one of my more entertaining expeditions.${prompt};
I wish the both of you happiness and good fortune...${prompt};
...even if it means losing one of my best guinea toads. Aha hah hah!;
Guinea toad! Hahahahaha! That was a good one, B!;
Manners, Salwa!${prompt};
Speaking of “good ones,” did you know that he thinks you might actually be more toad than Taru? Bwahahahaha!${prompt};
What are you laughing at!? Do I look like I enjoy eating bugs!?${prompt};
And so, I guess this is adios!${prompt};
Salwa the Unworthy has finally proven his worth.${prompt};
And now I can spend my time protecting the girl I love!${prompt};
And so as of today, I hang up my sword and shield to devote myself to my new family...;
...Good luck, my friends......your endeavors......;
......ake care...and......grib...;
Rgib...;

(((That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.)))${prompt};
Goodbye, Professor! Goodbye, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Farewell, my little friend.${prompt};
${name-player}...;
You seem troubled.${prompt};
Is there anything you wish to say?;
${selection-lines};
The Poroggo didn't do anything!;
The true culprit is Mikilulu!;
The girl was a toad all along!;
She's evil, I tell you!;
We have to warn Salwa-Molwa!;
You should be researching her!${prompt};
Aha hah hah!;
You have a keen sense of perception, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I, too, had considered that possibility.${prompt};
However, I lack the evidence required to construct a proper theory.${prompt};
So, why not conduct tests on Mikilulu right away?${prompt};
Listen carefully, ${name-player}. In the world of science, just because new light is shed upon a dark room of questions does not necessarily mean that light will lead you to the answers you seek.${prompt};
Especially when there are still many more lights remaining to examine before racing off blindly after a single one.${prompt};
I will continue to collect my small truths and piece them together until I can complete the final picture. Whether this takes months or even years, there is no need to rush science. She will show me what I seek when she deems it the right time to do so.${prompt};
And, who am I to disturb a loving couple the moment they find their happiness?${prompt};
Leave them be, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Nevertheless, these events prove that the truth is often stranger than fiction, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Pleasantries aside, the whole thing closely resembles the tale of “Poroggo and the Prince.” Why, the two are even planning a marriage, it seems.${prompt};
I believe I mentioned earlier that a good scientist does not mix science and fairy tales.${prompt};
Though I have learned much in the past few days, there is still little information on the Poroggo.${prompt};
After some of the amazing things we witnessed, it would be easy to attempt to tie those to superstition.${prompt};
However, this would only lead us farther from the truth.${prompt};
Ridding our mind of prejudice and predetermination, and approaching a problem with a clean slate is the only way to find what we seek.${prompt};
I believe this can be said for adventurers as well as scientists.${prompt};
${name-player}, it has been a pleasure working with you, and I hope that our paths cross again in the future.${prompt};
Ah, yes. And before I forget...${prompt};
Here is your reward.${prompt};
I hope it aids you on your travels.${prompt};
Farewell!;
Please wait a few moments and try inspecting the area again.${prompt};
Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt};
We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.;
Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, a new adventurer!;
Best of luck, kupo!${prompt};
Are you helping out the new adventurers?;
Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt};
You're not wearing your yukata!;
Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!${prompt};
Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt};
Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!;
I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!${prompt};
Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!;
When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!${prompt};
The face in the portrait you brought me is just...;
Kupupupu!${prompt};
Incredible, kupo!;
You must have nerves of darksteel!;
Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt};
You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?;
Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt};
You haven't earned my really special present yet!;
Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt};
This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt};
To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.;
Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt};
This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.;
Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt};
Please come back with a different partner.;
It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt};
Your partner isn't ready to go.;
Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt};
Your partner must talk to me as well.;
I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt};
You can only choose one partner a day.;
Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};
Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!;
You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt};
Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt};
Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt};
Are you ready to go?;
${selection-lines};
Ready, kupo!;
I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt};
I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.;
You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt};
If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!;
Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt};
You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt};
Hey, you changed partners!;
You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt};
Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!;
You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt};
Choose your partner wisely.;
Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt};
Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt};
Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?;
I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt};
Here, take this as a testament to your courage.;
Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt};
Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!;
Kupupupu...${prompt};
This place is crawling with nasties.;
You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt};
Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt};
I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.;
This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt};
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt};
If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt};

The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called “Voidwalkers.” Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;
By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt};
Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt};
Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt};
As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt};
Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt};
All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt};
Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt};
Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.${prompt};
