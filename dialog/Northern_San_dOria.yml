    Nothing.${prompt}
  8: Hmm...not much work for those wet behind the ears, but...${prompt}

  10: If you're to take the mission, I'll be happy to explain.${prompt}
  11: |-
    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me more.
    Never mind.${prompt}
  12: Here's your mission. Orcish scouts roam outside; kill one and bring me his axe as proof.${prompt}
  13: 'You''ll have to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. No other kind will do. Understand?${prompt}'
  14: That is all. You'll take the mission then?${prompt}

    Do you accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    I accept.
    Could you explain again?
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  16: Bring me one of those axes, and your mission will be a success. No running away now; we've a proud country to defend!${prompt}
  17: Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt}
  18: 'That''s another ${item-singular: 0[2]} for the armory, then. Mission complete! Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  19: What? I don't want this!${prompt}
  20: Are you really a new recruit!?${prompt}
  21: Listen, before you bring me something, you must first accept the mission! That is how things work around here!${prompt}
  22: Persistent, aren't you? An Orc under the belt does not a hero make! Ah, I've just the job for you...${prompt}
  23: Bat patrol! How about it? Shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer such as yourself, no?${prompt}
  24: Here's your mission, then. Clear out bats lurking in King Ranperre's Tomb and bring me a fang as proof.${prompt}
  25: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and your mission will be a success.${prompt}'
  26: Deep in the tomb you'll find Goblins. Take care; I don't want to lose you yet.${prompt}
  27: Ah, you've returned! I was afraid that Goblins got you.${prompt}
  28: 'That''s one ${item-singular: 3[2]} for the gatehouse, then. Mission complete. Not bad for a new recruit.${prompt}'
  29: Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt}
  30: Well, perhaps you can be of some help. Many of our children have disappeared mysteriously, and I've no doubt the Ghelsba Orcs are behind it.${prompt}
  31: The Royal Knights should be on the job by now, but the two princes are at each other's throats.${prompt}
  32: Prince Trion, the eldest, says we should launch a full attack, with all haste.${prompt}
  33: While his younger brother, Prince Pieuje says the safety of the children comes first, and he won't authorize an attack.${prompt}
  34: They've been arguing this back and forth for days. The knights' hands are tied, and frankly, nobody knows what to do.${prompt}
  35: If you really want to make a name for yourself, go to Ghelsba, and rescue those kidnapped children!${prompt}
  36: What say you? Will you go?${prompt}
  37: Here's your mission, then. Rescue the two children kidnapped by the Orcs of Ghelsba Outpost.${prompt}
  38: Ghelsba Outpost is northwest of West Ronfaure. Take the path before the Westgate, then turn right when the path splits in the forest. You'll find the entrance up in the hills.${prompt}
  39: If you have trouble finding the way, just follow one of the soldiers on patrol.${prompt}
  40: Orcs tend to keep their hostages in tents or small huts. Once you're inside the compound, check them first.${prompt}
  41: Ah, you've returned! You were gone so long, I feared a warmachine had got you!${prompt}
  42: At any rate, mission complete! And to reward your accomplishment...${prompt}
  43: I hereby recognize you, ${name-player}, as a certified adventurer of San d'Oria! You're now mission rank two, as well.${prompt}
  44: But don't get too excited. Your title is valid only here in San d'Oria, understand?${prompt}
  45: 'In order to become a true adventurer, and bear ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you must be recognized by Bastok and Windurst as well.${prompt}'
  46: '''Tis a treaty between the three lands, and its word is law. I know it''s hard, but those are the rules.${prompt}'
  47: For now, cut your adventuring teeth in the areas near here. Sooner or later you'll find your way into other lands.${prompt}
  48: You achieve rank 2!${prompt}
  49: There's not much work in right now. I suppose you could go participate in the Temple Knights' rescue drills out on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  50: Enter the forest beyond the Westgate and head southwest. You'll come out onto the La Theine Plateau before long.${prompt}
  51: Once you're out on the plateau, keep going until you see the knights. The training grounds aren't far from there.${prompt}
  52: It's all just a drill, so this should be easy compared to your usual fare. Just follow orders and you'll be fine.${prompt}
  53: You've returned! I hear the drill turned into something far more perilous. But real battle is the best drill for recruits, in my opinion.${prompt}
  54: Regardless, you've done well. I'll turn to you when there's work to be done, now.${prompt}
  55: 'Here, take this ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Go ahead, you''ve earned it.${prompt}'
  56: This time it's messenger duty. One of our knights is out scouting in a place called Davoi, on the southern edge of Jugner Forest.${prompt}
  57: The Orcs' stronghold is in Davoi, so it's vital that we stop them from massing, or they may launch an assault.${prompt}
  58: Of course, the Orcs are keeping an eye on us, too. Why, just a few days past, a squad of our Royal Knights fell to their axes.${prompt}
  59: We have sent scouts to find a weakness in their defenses. You must find the scout there now, and bring back the latest scouting report.${prompt}
  60: The scout's name is Zantaviat. He's somewhere in Davoi, but where I cannot say.${prompt}
  61: Come back after you've gotten the report. Those lands are no place to wander.${prompt}
  62: You have returned! And you've brought the scouting report. Good work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  63: Troubling news, this is. It says that Orcs are gathering deep inside the encampment. The time to act is coming!${prompt}
  64: But that is not your concern. You've done well today. Mission complete!${prompt}
  65: Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. And at just the right time, too. Monarlais Halver is looking for an adventurer such as yourself.${prompt}
  66: Enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver is there; he'll explain in person.${prompt}
  67: What? You haven't been certified in Bastok and Windurst yet? You may dally, but others are not! Get moving!${prompt}
  68: Ah, welcome back. I see you've been certified in Bastok and Windurst. Good work. You'll make a fine adventurer.${prompt}
  69: What's that, a report for our kingdom? I see. Take that to the monarlais when you go.${prompt}
  70: 'You should receive ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from Monarlais Halver. Now, go to Chateau d''Oraguille and let them know you''re back!${prompt}'
  71: Hurry to Chateau d'Oraguille and give that report to Monarlais Halver!${prompt}
  72: You achieve rank 3!${prompt}
  73: Ah! You've come at just the right time. Zantaviat, one of our scouts in Davoi, needs an adventurer.${prompt}
  74: He wants someone to infiltrate Davoi and scout behind enemy lines. Know anyone fitting that description?${prompt}
  75: 'Now that you''ve got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, this is an opportunity to prove you''re worth it!${prompt}'
  76: The situation in Davoi worsens by the day. This won't be easy, but I can't think of a better adventurer for the job!${prompt}
  77: You've returned! Zantaviat told me everything. Congratulations on a job well done!${prompt}
  78: But we can't let down our guard yet. Those Orcs will not just sit there. We must keep constant vigil, and move before they do!${prompt}
  79: 'Here''s your reward: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. You''re becoming quite the adventurer, aren''t you?${prompt}'
  80: Welcome back! I have an important mission for you this time. Recently, land is eroding due to crystal formation...and it's getting worse.${prompt}
  81: There's a small spring on the eastern edge of Jugner Forest, called Crystwater Spring. We must know what effect crystal formation has on the wildlife there.${prompt}
  82: 'I want you to get me a fish from the spring. And not just any fish! You need to get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  83: Ah, that reminds me--have you any fishing gear? You'll need some for this mission.${prompt}
  84: There are people about that know a thing or two about fishing, should you need help finding and choosing your gear.${prompt}
  85: Ah, the great angler returns! I was worried, to be honest. All you hear these days is the massing of beasts, the erosion of the Crystal Lines, and now...${prompt}
  86: '...rumors that the Shadow Lord himself has returned!${prompt}'
  87: We will examine the fish you brought. Depending on the results, we may need to act! I'll let you know if we need your help.${prompt}
  88: Ah, it's you, ${name-player}. You've come at a good time. I've news for you.${prompt}
  89: By order of the Kingdom of San d'Oria, you're to head to Jeuno as an ambassadorial attaché.${prompt}
  90: Go to Chateau d'Oraguille. Monarlais Halver will tell you all you need to know.${prompt}

  98: ${prompt}
  99: There you are! I've been looking for you. Monarlais Halver requests your presence at the chateau immediately.${prompt}
  100: It sounds as if this is a fairly important mission. I need not remind you that you should take care to properly equip yourself before embarking on this journey.${prompt}
  101: I'm not sure what it's about, but you'd best make haste. The monarlais is not to be kept waiting!${prompt}
  102: Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! This is no time for loafing around, friend! Prince Trion is looking for you.${prompt}
  103: For this next mission, he's requested you personally. You should be honored!${prompt}
  104: As for the details of the mission, I've no idea what he wants, but he was in a hurry. You'd best be off to Chateau d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  105: It is a great thing you've done, ${name-player}! I knew deep in my heart that you were the one for the task.${prompt}
  106: You'd better get to the chateau quick. They're all waiting to welcome you back, I'd wager.${prompt}
  107: You've saved our proud Kingdom of San d'Oria. No, you're the savior of all Vana'diel! There's not a soul that doesn't owe you a great debt, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  108: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    You had best hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille. It seems as if something terrible is in the works there.${prompt}
  109: |-
    Well, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Your timing is perfect. The chateau just sent a request for an adventurer.${prompt}
  110: It looks as if this next mission has something to do with the late queen. You should feel honored. It's not every day that an adventurer gets to work directly with the royal family.${prompt}
  111: |-
    Spoken like a true San d'Orian!
    Now hurry off to Chateau d'Oraguille and get the details on the mission from Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  112: What's wrong? Dealing with royalty is not your cup of tea? Well, think about it and come back when you've come to your senses.${prompt}
  113: Prince Trion is requesting the aid of an adventurer. How about it?${prompt}
  114: It looks fairly urgent, so you should hurry to the chateau. The prince is waiting in his chambers.${prompt}
  115: I expected more from you, ${name-player}. If you change your mind, return here. I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  116: I have received the details of your mission from Prince Trion. I will deliver this book to the scholars for deciphering.${prompt}
  117: 'The deciphering of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will take a considerable amount of time. Return later for a report.${prompt}'
  118: 'You handed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over to the guard.${prompt}'
  119: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. We've been waiting.
    Prince Trion is calling for you. I wonder if this means the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been completely deciphered.${prompt}
  120: Well done, ${name-player}! I knew you would not let the Kingdom down.${prompt}
  121: I'm proud to increase your rank to 7!${prompt}
  122: The papsque has work for you, ${name-player}. Are you willing to take on the task?${prompt}
  123: Excellent. Proceed to the papsque's chambers on the third floor of the cathedral.${prompt}
  124: The papsque often comes across as a difficult man, but he is actually very kindhearted and compassionate. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.${prompt}
  125: The fair Claidie I d'Oraguille has invited you to the chateau. She wishes for you to see the flowers that have bloomed from the seeds you brought back from Altepa.${prompt}
  126: It is an honor to be invited to the chateau garden. One day you may even have the opportunity to attend one of their royal garden parties.${prompt}
  127: We cannot keep the princess waiting. Now, off to the chateau!${prompt}
  128: A party of Royal Knights stationed in Ghelsba Outpost have reported strange activity by Orcs deep within Yughott Grotto.${prompt}
  129: From your reports, we already know that the beastmen have built a giant portal, but their motives remain unclear.${prompt}
  130: It makes me shudder to think of what those Orcs are planning with that portal...${prompt}
  131: ${name-player}, your next mission is to travel to Ghelsba and continue your investigation into the Orcs' activities.${prompt}
  132: Be on your guard when traveling deep into Yughott Grotto. Losing an adventurer such as yourself would deal a great blow to all of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  133: I see you need more time for preparations. When you are ready, I'll be waiting.${prompt}
  134: It's hard to believe Orcs have their hands on such dangerous equipment. More patrols will have to be sent out to prevent any new developments in their evil plans.${prompt}
  135: 'And this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... We will have to analyze it and begin reproduction for our forces. We cannot let Orcs get the Treasure of the Dragon King before San d''Oria does.${prompt}'
  136: Well, congratulations on the completion of your mission. Hmmm? Do I know of an adventurer named Eideialc? Never heard of him.${prompt}
  137: But you need not worry about some petty traveler. You are in a different league. You are now rank 8!${prompt}
  138: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near. This ceremony is an important facet of d'Oraguille tradition.${prompt}
  139: Monarlais Halver has put out a call to high-ranking adventurers for their assistance in Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  140: Ah, the young princess has finally become a lady... Oh, I'm sorry. You can get the details of your next mission from Sir Halver.${prompt}
  141: What? You do not wish to repay the kindness the princess has shown to you in the past months? As you wish...but if you change your mind, you know where to find me.${prompt}
  142: I am busy with preparations for Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony. You don't know what kind of vermin could be roaming the streets and looking for trouble.${prompt}
  143: Princess Claidie's coming-of-age ceremony is about to begin at the cathedral. I must remain at my post, but why don't you attend?${prompt}
  144: The king has requested your audience. He has selected you from the mountain of adventurers in San d'Oria. You should feel honored!${prompt}
  145: You have matured from a fledgling adventurer into a great asset to our kingdom. Do not let us down.${prompt}
  146: There is no need for modesty at a time like this. The fate of San d'Oria is at stake!${prompt}
  147: The authorities are saying that a dark cloud of despair is looming over the Kingdom. They are asking for the assistance of only the best adventurers.${prompt}
  148: I can think of none more qualified than you. Will you accept this mission?${prompt}
  149: |-
    Then proceed to the Audience Chamber in the Chateau d'Oraguille.
    Word has it that His Highness is not feeling that well. He may not be present for your briefing.${prompt}
  150: ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! The Kingdom is counting on you. Who else, I ask you, is worthy for this task?${prompt}
  151: Ah, a time of great change is upon us. In a matter of days, the Rites of Succession will be held at the cathedral in Northern San d'Oria. It is then that the new heir to the throne will be decided.${prompt}
  152: Due to the unpredictable circumstances that took place at the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, this time, only authorized personnel will be allowed near the proceedings. However, the royal family has requested your services as a guard.${prompt}
  153: Even we Royal Knights have not been granted permission to attend... You must be held in high regard by His Highness. I envy you, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Ma'am].${prompt}
  154: When you have finished your preparations, proceed directly to the cathedral to report.${prompt}
  155: Off the record, which of the two princes do you think should be the next heir to the throne?${prompt}
  156: |-
    It is a difficult decision, but...
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion is better suited.
    Pieuje is better suited.${prompt}
  157: |-
    Hm...
    Being the oldest, he is the true heir, and many people believe he is the most suited to rule the Kingdom. However, Prince Pieuje's prudent ways may be what this country is lacking.${prompt}
  158: Many think as you do, ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}. However, what this country may need is someone who will not back down in the face of a threat--someone who will stand up for the pride of the Kingdom.${prompt}
  159: But our opinion is of no matter. Lightbringer will decide who is the most suited to stand over our fine nation. And do not speak a word of today's exchange, for the monarlais will have our heads if he finds out.${prompt}
  160: I realize that you must have many preparations before taking on such an important mission. Take your time and return here when you are ready.${prompt}

    Now, what business would an adventurer have in the Carpenters' Guild?

  7551: Prince Trion, is there something you wish to add?${prompt}
  7552: |-
    ...
    I will not deny that the participation of adventurers has been of great benefit to the conquest, as well as maintained a new level of safety in the outlying regions.${prompt}
  7553: In addition, the many treaties signed by our nations have successfully paved a path of peace. No longer need our border guards fear attacks from our friends to the south and east.${prompt}
  7554: However, the beastman forces display no signs of weakening. Those noble guards stationed in faraway lands must deal with this reality constantly...and the burden has begun taking its toll.${prompt}
  7555: The already large gap between the guards on our borders and the guards in the Outlands expands with each day. If nothing is done, morale shall continue to fall while discontent grows.${prompt}
  7556: I sense that my kingdom is not alone in these worries.${prompt}
  7557: Soldier morale...${prompt}

  7563: |-
    Doctor Shantotto...
    I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt}

    Really?
    Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.${prompt}

  7592: |-
    Exactly!
    You'd better have something interesting to say.
    Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt}
  7593: Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  7594: Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt}
  7595: |-
    Yes.
    Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt}
  7596: Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt}
  7597: Excenmille was furious.${prompt}
  7598: Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt}
  7599: According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt}
  7600: However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt}
  7601: That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt}
  7602: Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt}
  7603: |-
    ...
    I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight.
    Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?${prompt}
  7604: Excenmille offered me with the following suggestion...${prompt}
  7605: Revive Conflict!${prompt}
  7606: '...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7607: '...!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7608: |-
    C-Conflict!?
    A series of games based on battle exercises, played by select heroes from each of the nations...${prompt}
  7609: |-
    Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War.
    You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt}
  7610: That is what I propose.${prompt}
  7611: |-
    Conflict...
    An interesting idea...${prompt}
  7612: There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt}
  7613: However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt}
  7614: If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt}
  7615: |-
    Prince Trion, Prince Trion.
    If that's all that you wanted to say,
    you didn't have to go beat around the bush all day.${prompt}

    A little feuding fun could do no harm.${prompt}
  7617: Shantotto!?${prompt}
  7618: |-
    Oh, there's nothing to get all excited about. The forces of Windurst are in good hands.
    A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.${prompt}

    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  7634: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  7635: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  7636: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7637: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  7638: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  7639: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  7640: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  7641: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  7642: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  7643: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  7644: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7645: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  7646: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  7647: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7648: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  7649: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  7650: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  7651: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  7652: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  7653: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  7654: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  7655: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  7656: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  7657: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  7658: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  7659: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  7660: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  7661: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  7662: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  7663: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}
  7664: |-

    However, there is one last task I must ask you to perform before approving your application.${prompt}
  7801: Travel to Bastok and Windurst and meet with their leaders. You need not worry with the details. They already know you will be coming.${prompt}
  7802: I also wish you to deliver these letters to the two nations' Conflict Commanders.${prompt}
  7803: A lofty Galka, Ginu...Invincible Shield, will be waiting for you in Bastok.${prompt}
  7804: And I recall the Commander of Windurst's forces was a Mithra named Mhabi...something-or-other. I have such trouble remembering foreign names.${prompt}
  7805: |-
    That is all. You may set off immediately.
    I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7806: |-
    Wonderful!
    I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.${prompt}
  7807: To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.${prompt}
  7808: And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.${prompt}
  7809: I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.${prompt}
  7810: Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!${prompt}
  7811: |-
    Heh heh heh...
    When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!${prompt}
  7812: |-
    You've made the right choice, soldier!
    From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!${prompt}
  7813: |-
    Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once!
    You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!${prompt}
  7814: |-
    What!?
    Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!?
    The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!${prompt}
  7815: |-
    After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations!
    Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst!
    Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!${prompt}
  7817: |-
    You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7818: Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt}
  7819: Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.${prompt}
  7820: What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7821: Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.${prompt}
  7822: Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!${prompt}
  7823: |-
    Now listen up, soldier!
    After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot!
    And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7824: |-
    Welcome back from your journey.
    ......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.${prompt}
  7825: |-
    Well done, ${name-player}.
    Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost!
    ...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, ${name-player}. You've just made my day.${prompt}
  7827: Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!${prompt}
  7829: |-
    If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives!
    Don't you forget that, soldier!${prompt}
  7830: |-
    Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform!
    Get moving!${prompt}
  7831: 'I commend you, ${name-player}. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7832: This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.${prompt}
  7833: As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.${prompt}
  7834: |-
    Ah, I almost forgot.
    Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them.
    That is all.${prompt}
  7836: 'OK! You''rrre done. Here''s your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  7837: With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.${prompt}
  7838: And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7839: |-
    Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
    Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.${prompt}
  7840: They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!${prompt}
  7841: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  7842: The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.${prompt}
  7843: We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!${prompt}
  7844: In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!${prompt}
  7845: |-
    While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7846: I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...${prompt}
  7847: |-
    All right, soldier, listen up!
    Repeat after me the following rules!${prompt}
  7848: Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...${prompt}
  7849: An exquisite display of force, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7850: It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!${prompt}
  7851: Great job out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7852: The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!${prompt}
  7853: |-
    Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory!
    But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!${prompt}
  7854: |-
    Now get back out there, soldier!
    Do you want to live forever!?${prompt}
  7855: |-
    Unthinkable...
    A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.${prompt}
  7856: If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7857: |-
    I cannot believe what I am hearing...
    A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...${prompt}
  7858: Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7859: You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...${prompt}
  7860: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}! You'rrre making me look bad!${prompt}
  7861: |-
    Hissssss!
    You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...${prompt}
  7862: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!${prompt}
  7863: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!${prompt}
  7864: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Do not make me repeat these words, ${name-player}! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7865: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched!
    But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!${prompt}
  7866: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7867: I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...${prompt}
  7868: Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!${prompt}
  7869: |-
    A draw!
    A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!${prompt}
  7870: |-
    You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  7871: So close, yet so farrr...${prompt}
  7872: Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?${prompt}
  7873: 'You wish to know about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.${prompt}'
  7874: While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.${prompt}
  7875: You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7876: |-
    You want to see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Here, take a look.
    These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.${prompt}
  7877: When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.${prompt}
  7878: He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    Listen up, soldier!
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will not guarantee you victory, but it can make the difference in a close battle!${prompt}
  7880: In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!${prompt}
  7881: And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!${prompt}
  7882: |-
    Ask for an earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7883: A wise decision, ${name-player}. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.${prompt}
  7884: |-
    Here, let me put it on for you.
    Hmmm...
    You look great!
    Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!${prompt}
  7885: |-
    Smart move, soldier!
    Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!${prompt}
  7886: I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.${prompt}
  7887: Well, if you think that you don't need one...${prompt}
  7888: If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!${prompt}
  7889: 'What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  7890: 'How''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} worrrking? Or maybe you don''t need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.${prompt}'
  7891: 'Is there something wrong with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt}'
  7892: |-
    Return the earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  7893: Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.${prompt}
  7894: Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.${prompt}
  7895: |-
    Well, it's about time!
    I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7896: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?${prompt}
  7897: |-
    ???
    If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.${prompt}
  7898: |-
    Does this look like Windurst, maggot!?
    If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force!
    Move! Move! Move!${prompt}
  7899: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!${prompt}
  7900: |-
    Are you talking to me?
    Are you talking to me?
    Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.${prompt}
  7901: |-
    What is that smell!?
    Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer!
    If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!${prompt}
  7902: |-
    Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license...
    I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.${prompt}
  7903: Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...${prompt}
  7904: |-
    Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation!
    What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!${prompt}
  7905: Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?${prompt}
  7906: |-
    You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers.
    However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.${prompt}
  7907: |-
    Wait, don't tell me...
    You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!?
    (Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)${prompt}
  7908: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?
    Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7909: |-
    So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?
    It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt}
  7910: I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt}
  7911: What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7912: |-
    .........
    How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt}
  7913: |-
    You!
    Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!${prompt}
  7914: A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...${prompt}
  7915: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt}
  7916: Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt}
  7917: What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?${prompt}
  7918: |-
    .........
    If he thinks that I...${prompt}
  7919: |-
    You!
    You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7920: A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7921: |-
    .........
    I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!${prompt}
  7922: |-
    You!
    Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!${prompt}
  7923: A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!${prompt}
  7924: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt}
  7925: |-
    You!
    You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!${prompt}
  7926: |-
    What is that you have there, maggot!?
    A shopping list from your mommy!?${prompt}
  7927: |-
    .........
    Th...vixen...sh...I...ki...${prompt}
  7928: |-
    You!
    You tell that worthless commander of yours that she can scream and she can cry, but I will show her no mercy on the battlefield!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7929: |-
    Excellent show, ${name-player}!
    I have just received word that ${choice: 0}[you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].${prompt}
  7930: I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!${prompt}
  7931: I just received the news, ${name-player}! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.${prompt}
  7932: I applaud you on your skill! Maybe it's time I challenged you to a little one-on-one...${prompt}
  7933: 'Well, if it isn''t the pond scum I found floating on my toilet this morning... What is this? You mean to tell me that you ${choice: 0}[were awarded some fancy chevron!?/were the top scorer at the last Ballista match!?] I... I...${prompt}'
  7934: |-
    What are you looking at, soldier!? Haven't you seen anyone with dust in their eye!?
    Just because by some fluke you had a fine day on the Ballista field doesn't mean squat!
    Now get back out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7935: I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt}
  7936: After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt}
  7937: |-
    A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--

    G-grave news, kupo!!!
    Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt}
  7940: Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt}
  7941: |-
    Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!
    Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt}

  7943: 'This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt}'
  7944: 'We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt}'
  7945: 'To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You''ll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt}'

    Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!
    Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt}
  7950: A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt}
  7951: Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt}

  11126: Prince Trion, I was explaining to this recruit here about what it means to be a proud citizen of San d'Oria!${prompt}
  11127: A recruit? Strengthen your sword arm and your stature as a knight. Thus will you best serve the glory of our great kingdom.${prompt}
  11128: San d'Oria has more than enough soldiers already, brother. Speaking of which, should you not be training them, instead of bothering new recruits with talk of war?${prompt}
  11129: You are too bold!${prompt}
  11130: Really, Pieuje! Is that any way to speak to your brother?${prompt}
  11131: I've said the truth, nothing more. The ranks of our armies could swell to bursting, and victory would still be far.${prompt}
  11132: It is your head that is swollen, brother. With enough numbers, we could crush the beastmen! And without having to resort to your misguided tactics!${prompt}
  11133: My tactics, misguided? Oh, that is rich! Tell me of the tactics that lost an entire company in Batallia Downs the other day?${prompt}
  11134: It's good you're so fond of talking, as I've never seen you wield a sword! Better to shout orders from the rear than reveal your ineptitude in actual combat!${prompt}
  11135: Stop your quarreling, both of you!${prompt}
  11136: A divided leadership only creates unrest among the people, soldier and civilian alike. Surely you are both aware of this?${prompt}
  11137: Oh, I suppose. I warn you, Pieuje, talk to me that way again and I won't be so forgiving.${prompt}
  11138: Good old Trion. Threats of violence are his only recourse when a conversation does not go his way. Like a child, he is!${prompt}
  11139: They are both like children, quick to insult and quicker to take offense! Really...${prompt}

  11170: Il est probablement dans une taverne maintenant. Vous feriez mieux de rester loin des joueurs comme lui.${prompt}

  11315: Surveille ton langage, forgeron insolent ! Ne sais-tu pas qui je suis ? Je suis le Seigneur Ancolain, officier des Chevaliers Royaux !${prompt}
  11316: Vraiment, comportez-vous bien ! Pourquoi ne pas simplement trouver un aventurier pour faire le travail ?${prompt}
  11317: Les choses ne sont généralement pas aussi agitées par ici, vraiment. Dis, tu as l'air d'un aventurier, toi-même. Qu'en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  11318: Tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Comme tu as pu l'entendre, nous avons besoin de tes services.${prompt}
  11319: |-
    Écouter ce qu'il a à dire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Écouter.
    Tourner le dos.${prompt}
  11320: Mon... Les aventuriers de nos jours ! Trop occupés pour donner un coup de main.${prompt}
  11321: Écoute bien, il y a beaucoup d'Orcs dans les camps de Ghelsba, et certains portent des couteaux.${prompt}
  11322: Pourrais-tu rassembler dix de ces couteaux et les apporter ici ? Nous n'avons pas beaucoup de temps.${prompt}
  11323: Comment ça va ? As-tu récupéré les couteaux ?${prompt}
  11324: 'Il semble que tu aies ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[couteau/couteaux] pour le moment. Apporte encore ${number: 1}, et fais vite, s’il te plaît !${prompt}'
  11325: Notre vaillant aventurier est revenu ! Tu as apporté les dix ! Donne-les-nous, alors.${prompt}
  11326: Voilà 10 couteaux orques. Parfait, et merci.${prompt}
  11327: Je... vois.${prompt}
  11328: Je suis en plein milieu de quelque chose d'important. S'il te plaît, sois silencieux.${prompt}
  11329: Ne vois-tu pas que je suis occupé ? Si tu as une affaire, parle-moi plus tard.${prompt}
  11330: On dirait que cet officier est dans le pétrin. Peut-être pourrais-tu l'aider, hein ?${prompt}
  11331: Cet officier chantait tes louanges. Oui, tu as les qualités d'un bon aventurier !${prompt}
  11332: C'est un signe des temps troublés quand nous sommes aussi occupés. J'apprécie les gils supplémentaires, mais m'inquiéter pour ma peau n'en vaut pas la peine.${prompt}
  11333: Un forgeron n'est pas jugé par sa force, mais par son habileté dans son art !${prompt}
  11334: Voici le reliquaire, où notre défunt papsque, Muchavatte, est enterré.${prompt}
  11335: Nous continuons notre discipline spirituelle ici, pour que nous puissions atteindre le Paradis comme Sa Sainteté avant nous.${prompt}
  11336: Regardez les bougies de chaque côté de l'épitaphe. Leurs flammes brûlent vigilamment depuis le départ du Papsque Muchavatte.${prompt}
  11337: Elles sont placées ici pour éclairer son chemin vers le Paradis.${prompt}
  11338: 'Mais beaucoup de bougies sont nécessaires pour éclairer son voyage. Les fidèles doivent toujours apporter ${item-plural: 0[2]} pour la fabrication de bougies.${prompt}'
  11339: 'Nous demandons humblement aux visiteurs de donner deux ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Ferais-tu une offrande ?${prompt}'
  11340: 'Altana sourit aux généreux. Une fois que tu as obtenu deux ${item-plural: 0[2]}, apporte-les ici.${prompt}'
  11341: Assurément, le défunt papsque te désapprouve. Reviens ici quand tu te souviendras de la charité.${prompt}
  11342: Que le Paradis t'ouvre ses portes.${prompt}
  11343: 'Je te remercie pour avoir offert deux ${item-plural: 0[2]}. Le défunt papsque serait satisfait.${prompt}'
  11344: 'En remerciement pour ton service, la cathédrale de San d’Oria te présente ce ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Porte-le, et la providence d’Altana sera tienne.${prompt}'
  11345: Je te remercie pour ton généreux don, mais je crains de ne pouvoir l’accepter.${prompt}
  11346: J'attends ton offrande.${prompt}
  11347: Merci pour ton généreux service.${prompt}
  11348: Ah, si ce n'est notre aventurier préféré ! Les invités étaient ravis, grâce à toi.${prompt}
  11349: En fait, nous avons encore besoin de ton aide... si tu as le temps, bien sûr.${prompt}
  11350: Un de nos invités d'hier soir a attrapé froid. Nous voudrions l'aider, mais nous n'avons pas de médicament, tu vois.${prompt}
  11351: Il y a une vieille femme nommée Amaura, une préparatrice de baumes et de médicaments, dans le Sud de San d'Oria. Pourrais-tu en obtenir un d'elle ?${prompt}
  11352: Bien sûr, il y a aussi quelque chose pour toi. Qu'en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  11353: Alors, tu as décidé de parler à Amaura pour nous ?${prompt}
  11354: Je vois... Je vais devoir chercher quelqu'un d'autre. Reviens si tu changes d'avis.${prompt}
  11355: Je savais que tu étais la bonne personne à qui demander, comme toujours !${prompt}
  11356: Amaura vit dans la ruelle du Chien de Garde. Si tu ne la trouves pas, demande à quelqu'un en chemin. Je t'attendrai ici !${prompt}
  11357: Ah, juste ce qu'il faut ! Je vais te l'acheter et le donner à l'invité tout de suite !${prompt}
  11358: Tu as été d'une grande aide, encore une fois. Je ne sais pas comment te remercier !${prompt}
  11359: Hrm... Mystères... Pourquoi cette partie est-elle différente de toutes les autres ?${prompt}
  11360: Un reçu, hein ? Je ne peux pas lire cette écriture élégante. Pour qui est-ce ? Le Prince Trion ou le Prince Pieuje ?${prompt}
  11361: |-
    Pour qui est-ce ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Prince Trion.
    Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
  11362: （トリオン様に渡してほしい。）${prompt}
  11363: （ピエージェ様に渡してほしい。）${prompt}
  11364: D'accord, je vais le livrer pour vous. Nous ne pouvons pas vous laisser entrer dans cet état ! Attendez ici.${prompt}

  11366: 'J''ai livré ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au Prince Pieuje. Vous êtes congédié.${prompt}'
  11367: Imbécile ! Cette enveloppe était pour le Prince Trion, pas le Prince Pieuje ! Quelle idiotie... Sortez d'ici !${prompt}
  11368: Imbécile ! Cette enveloppe était pour le Prince Pieuje, pas le Prince Trion ! Quelle idiotie... Sortez d'ici !${prompt}
  11369: Oh, et dites à ce commerçant d'envoyer quelqu'un de respectable la prochaine fois !${prompt}
  11370: J'ai livré le reçu. Transmettez les salutations du prince à ce commerçant.${prompt}
  11371: Rien à signaler.${prompt}
  11372: Voici le Château d'Oraguille, la plus grande forteresse du royaume !${prompt}
  11373: Vous êtes devant le Château d'Oraguille. Si vous n'avez pas d'affaire ici, partez !${prompt}
  11374: Hé ! Qui vous a dit que vous pouviez entrer ? Revenez ici, vaurien !${prompt}
  11375: Allez-y !${prompt}
  11376: Voici l'Arche de la Victoire. Au-delà se trouve la San d'Oria Sud.${prompt}
  11377: Vous êtes devant l'Arche de la Victoire. La San d'Oria Sud est de l'autre côté.${prompt}
  11378: Ce portail mène au Port de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11379: Voici la Porte de Ranperre. Des monstres rôdent dans les terres au-delà, alors soyez prudents !${prompt}
  11380: Bénis sont ceux qui chérissent Altana et écoutent la parole du papsque. Pour eux, les Portes du Paradis s'ouvriront.${prompt}
  11381: Nous sommes ici pour voir le papsque s'adresser aux fidèles. Il se tient parfois sur le balcon de la cathédrale sous le clocher.${prompt}
  11382: Hmm... Sa Sainteté devrait bientôt apparaître.${prompt}
  11383: Je le vois ! Le papsque !${prompt}
  11384: Oui, le voilà !${prompt}
  11385: Bien-aimée San d'Oria, Altana veille toujours sur nous.${prompt}
  11386: Elle est l'alliée des faibles. Elle nourrit les affamés et habille les nécessiteux.${prompt}
  11387: Elle nous a donné le chemin vers le Paradis éternel. Par cette épreuve, elle nous jugera tous.${prompt}
  11388: Que les portes du Paradis s'ouvrent à tous ses enfants !${prompt}
  11389: Ses mots résonnent dans mon cœur, longtemps après qu'ils soient prononcés.${prompt}
  11390: Chaque fois que je vois le papsque, j'ai l'impression de me rapprocher d'un pas de plus vers le Paradis !${prompt}
  11391: Tout le monde devrait chercher la bénédiction du papsque lui-même !${prompt}
  11392: Bienvenue au Consulat de Jeuno. Je suis Galahad, Consul à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11393: Puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  11394: Si vous avez des affaires avec le Consul Galahad, vous le trouverez à l'intérieur.${prompt}
  11395: Bienvenue au Consulat de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11396: Bonjour. Je suis le consul de Bastok. Je m'appelle Helaku.${prompt}
  11397: 'Je suis le Consul Helaku. Vous n''avez pas apporté ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Bon, regardez autour de vous alors. Autant profiter de l’endroit pendant que vous êtes ici.${prompt}'
  11398: Pardonnez-moi, mais nous sommes en pleine discussion très importante.${prompt}
  11399: Vous êtes ici pour des affaires de l'administration, n'est-ce pas ? Je crois que vous devriez parler au Consul Helaku.${prompt}
  11400: Vous êtes ici pour des affaires de l'administration, n'est-ce pas ? Vous devriez probablement parler au Consul Helaku.${prompt}
  11401: Bienvenue au Consulat de Bastok.${prompt}
  11402: Un San d'Orian, hein ? Ici, c'est le Consulat de Bastok. Nous sommes là pour servir les voyageurs de Bastok.${prompt}
  11403: Un Windurstien, hein ? Ici, c'est le Consulat de Bastok. Le Consulat de Windurst est juste à l'extérieur.${prompt}
  11404: Consul Helaku ? Entrez.${prompt}
  11405: 'Vraiment ? Vous ne dites pas... Merci.${wait-animation: 3}${prompt}'
  11406: Vous venez de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ? Je suis Lion, un aventurier itinérant, pourrait-on dire.${prompt}
  11407: Vous venez de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ? Je suis Lion, un aventurier itinérant, pourrait-on dire.${prompt}
  11408: Avez-vous entendu ? Les Orcs ont une nouvelle base avancée à Ghelsba, au nord-ouest. Maintenant, leurs yeux avides sont tournés vers cette terre !${prompt}
  11409: Les Orcs sont cruels et violents. Ils attaquent les voyageurs sur la route et volent des enfants, tout cela pour inspirer la terreur chez les gens de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11410: Mais, il y a une chose qui n'a tout simplement pas de sens.${prompt}
  11411: Les Orcs n'étaient jamais connus pour leur artisanat, mais ils portent des armures et des armes encore meilleures dernièrement.${prompt}
  11412: Je soupçonne qu'il y a quelqu'un derrière les Orcs, tirant les ficelles, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.${prompt}
  11413: Quelqu'un doit découvrir leurs plans et agir, avant que ce pays ne tombe sous une invasion orc !${prompt}
  11414: Les gens murmurent dans les rues des troubles dans la maison royale. Ils devraient se concentrer sur ce qui se passe à l'extérieur de leurs murs d'abord, si vous voulez mon avis.${prompt}
  11415: Eh bien, je ne m'attends pas à ce que les choses deviennent plus faciles par ici avant un moment, mais prenez soin de vous, tout de même.${prompt}
  11416: Vous devez être fatigué de votre voyage. Mais d'abord, laissez-moi vous mettre au courant de la situation ici à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11417: Au nord-ouest de la ville se trouve un village orc. Ils l'appellent le Poste de Ghelsba.${prompt}
  11418: Nos rapports indiquent que les Orcs utilisent Ghelsba comme base avancée pour une invasion prochaine de San d'Oria, mais certaines choses ne collent pas.${prompt}
  11419: Nous savons tous que les Orcs sont des bêtes, non ? Dire qu'ils manquent de cervelle serait un euphémisme.${prompt}
  11420: C'est pourquoi je me demande comment ils ont obtenu les armures et armes de haute qualité qu'ils utilisent. Sans parler des armes à distance et des dispositifs !${prompt}
  11421: Nous soupçonnons qu'il y a quelqu'un derrière les bêtes qui tire les ficelles, mais nous n'avons aucune idée de qui.${prompt}
  11422: J'aimerais pouvoir vous envoyer à Ghelsba immédiatement, mais dans cette région, les missions officielles nécessitent l'approbation de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11423: Ce que je veux que vous fassiez, c'est aller au Château d'Oraguille et parler à Monarlais Halver. Il vous délivrera un ordre de mission officiel.${prompt}
  11424: Sortez de ce bâtiment, et vous verrez une grande forteresse sur la droite. C'est le Château d'Oraguille. Et soyez poli ; les San d'Orians peuvent être assez sensibles.${prompt}
  11425: On dirait que Lord Halver vous a donné vos ordres. Bonne chance, et soyez prudent là-bas.${prompt}
  11426: C'est bon de vous voir en forme ! Lord Helaku sera ravi de vous revoir.${prompt}
  11427: Bienvenue ! Vous ne vous êtes pas blessé, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11428: Monarlais Halver me dit que vous êtes allé vaincre le Chef de Guerre Vatgit, hein ?${prompt}
  11429: Beaucoup d'aventuriers se dirigent vers le Poste de Ghelsba, mais la plupart font demi-tour une fois qu'ils atteignent le campement supérieur.${prompt}
  11430: Eh bien, vous avez fait un excellent travail. En tant que consul, je suis honoré de vous féliciter pour une mission bien accomplie.${prompt}
  11431: Je veillerai à ce que San d'Oria fasse de vous un aventurier certifié, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11432: Maintenant que c'est réglé, votre prochain objectif est Windurst ! Le monde est sauvage là-bas, alors restez sur vos gardes.${prompt}
  11433: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Tenez, reprenez-le.${prompt}
  11434: 'Juste ce qu’il faut ! Je compte ${number: 0}; pas plus, pas moins. Bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  11435: 'Prochain arrêt : Windurst, hein ? Bonne chance, et faites attention !${prompt}'
  11436: Ah, ${name-player}, c'est bien ça ? J'ai entendu de bonnes choses à votre sujet de la part du Consul Melek à Windurst.${prompt}
  11437: San d'Oria est en guerre contre la horde orc. C'est difficile pour les habitants. Ils ne peuvent même pas sortir sans craindre pour leur vie de nos jours.${prompt}
  11438: La maison royale essaie de réprimer les bêtes. Mais avec tant d'intrigues dans la famille royale, ils ne peuvent pas agir de manière décisive !${prompt}
  11439: Mais je ne devrais pas vous retenir trop longtemps. Je ne connais pas les détails de votre mission spéciale, moi-même.${prompt}
  11440: Vous devez vous rendre au Château d'Oraguille et parler au monarlais de San d'Oria, Lord Halver. Il vous dira tout ce que vous devez savoir.${prompt}
  11441: Vous l'avez encore fait ! Vous me rendez fier !${prompt}
  11442: 'Vous avez été officiellement certifié par le Roi de San d''Oria. Maintenant, tout ce qu’il reste à faire est de rentrer chez vous et d’obtenir votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, et vous serez un aventurier officiel.${prompt}'
  11443: Hâtez-vous de rentrer au pays et allez voir Naji au Bureau du Président. Il vous attendra.${prompt}
  11444: Aussi, je vous serais très reconnaissant si vous pouviez rapporter ce rapport quand vous rentrerez. N'oubliez pas de le lui donner.${prompt}
  11445: Vous feriez mieux de retourner au pays. Naji se demande probablement où vous êtes maintenant.${prompt}
  11446: Eh bien, si ce n'est pas ${name-player}! Vous avez bonne mine ! Restez aussi longtemps que vous le souhaitez. Vous méritez un repos, mon ami.${prompt}
  11447: Salutations ! Je suis le Consul Kasaroro, à votre service. Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  11448: 'Je suis le Consul Kasaroro. Quoi ? Vous n''avez pas apporté ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Vous devrez en apporter un si vous avez des affaires avec moi !${prompt}'
  11449: Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst !${prompt}
  11450: Si vous cherchez le consul, elle est à l'intérieur !${prompt}
  11451: Un San d'Orian, n'est-ce pas ? Ici, c'est le Consulat de Windurst. Nous fournissons toutes sortes d'aide à nos compatriotes.${prompt}
  11452: Un Bastoker, n'est-ce pas ? Ici, c'est le Consulat de Windurst. Si vous cherchez votre consulat, il est dehors, juste en face.${prompt}
  11453: Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst. La Consule Kasaroro est à l'intérieur, si vous la cherchez.${prompt}
  11454: Vous êtes venu sur ordre de la patrie, n'est-ce pas ? Vous devriez parler avec la Consule Kasaroro.${prompt}
  11455: Salutations, ${name-player}! Je suis la Consule Kasaroro. Laissez-moi vous parler des événements actuels ici dans le Royaume de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11456: Les bêtes connues sous le nom d'Orcs augmentent régulièrement en nombre à l'extérieur de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11457: Ils ont installé une base avancée à Ghelsba, au nord-ouest de San d'Oria. De là, ils prévoient de lancer une invasion !${prompt}
  11458: Les Orcs adorent la bataille, mais ils ne sont pas très malins. Il y a juste une chose...${prompt}
  11459: Il semble que leurs armures et armes s'améliorent de jour en jour ! Maintenant, ils utilisent aussi des pièges et des arcs !${prompt}
  11460: Moi et quelques autres pensons qu'il y a quelqu'un derrière ces Orcs, qui leur fournit le matériel et donne les ordres. Mais il n'y a pas assez d'éléments pour l'instant.${prompt}
  11461: Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi, je vous enverrais à Ghelsba immédiatement ! Mais ici, c'est San d'Oria, et les missions sont de leur juridiction.${prompt}
  11462: Donc, vous devriez d'abord parler à Monarlais Halver au Château d'Oraguille. Il vous donnera des ordres officiels.${prompt}
  11463: Sortez tout de suite, et vous verrez un grand château sur la gauche. C'est le Château d'Oraguille. Ils sont un peu sensibles là-dedans, alors surveillez vos manières !${prompt}
  11464: Alors, vous avez reçu une offre de Monarlais Halver ? Excellent ! Faites attention là-bas.${prompt}
  11465: Bon retour. J'espère que vous ne vous êtes pas blessé ?${prompt}
  11466: J'ai entendu du monarlais que vous êtes allé combattre le grand Chef de Guerre Vatgit !${prompt}
  11467: Beaucoup d'aventuriers voient le Poste de Ghelsba en mission, mais la plupart rebroussent chemin au campement des hauteurs !${prompt}
  11468: Vous avez fait un excellent travail ! Je suis fier d'être votre consul.${prompt}
  11469: Je demanderai formellement à la cour de San d'Oria de vous certifier, ${name-player}, comme aventurier officiel.${prompt}
  11470: Maintenant, tout ce que vous avez à faire est d'obtenir la reconnaissance de Bastok. Restez sur vos gardes, et tout ira bien !${prompt}
  11471: Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai demandé. Reprenez-le !${prompt}
  11472: 'Ah ! ${number: 0}! Merci beaucoup. Votre mission ici est terminée !${prompt}'
  11473: Maintenant, vous devez simplement accomplir une mission pour Bastok ! Le monde est dangereux dehors, alors soyez prudent !${prompt}
  11474: Pourquoi, c'est ${name-player} ! J'ai entendu parler de votre succès de la part du Consul Patt-Pott à Bastok. On dirait que vous avez fait un excellent travail !${prompt}
  11475: Ce Patt-Pott parle à un mille à la minute, alors il était difficile de comprendre ce qu'il disait au début...${prompt}
  11476: Mais ça n'a pas d'importance ! La guerre continue ici à San d'Oria, et les civils essaient de faire face.${prompt}
  11477: Je sais que le Royaume veut régler les choses rapidement, mais avec tout le remue-ménage dans la famille royale, ils ne peuvent pas se concentrer sur la guerre !${prompt}
  11478: Il y a une mission spéciale qui vous attend. Même moi, je n'ai pas entendu de quoi il s'agit !${prompt}
  11479: Vous devrez vous rendre au Château d'Oraguille et demander à Monarlais Halver. Il vous expliquera tout !${prompt}
  11480: J'ai entendu parler de ce que vous avez fait, et je dois dire que je suis impressionné ! Vous me rendez fier d'être Windurstien !${prompt}
  11481: 'J’ai entendu dire que vous avez été officiellement reconnu par San d''Oria. La prochaine fois que vous retournerez au pays, récupérez votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11482: De plus, lorsque vous rentrerez, pourriez-vous remettre ce rapport à Lady Kupipi, à la Tour des Cieux ? N'oubliez pas !${prompt}
  11483: Maintenant, rentrez chez vous ! Je suis sûr que Lady Kupipi attend impatiemment votre retour.${prompt}
  11484: ${name-player}, c'est bien ça ? Vous semblez en forme ! Restez aussi longtemps que vous le souhaitez !${prompt}
  11485: Très bien, encore une fois !${prompt}
  11486: Un !${prompt}
  11487: Deux !${prompt}
  11488: Arrêtez !${prompt}
  11489: Qu'est-ce que cela signifie ? Ne m'interrompez pas !${prompt}
  11490: Bienvenue. Nous avons toutes sortes de meubles ici !${prompt}
  11491: Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  11492: Un pickpocket, dites-vous ? Maintenant que j'y pense, j'ai bien vu un vaurien rôder...${prompt}
  11493: Hmm... Je n'ai aucune idée de ce dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  11494: Un pickpocket ? Non, je n'ai vu personne de ce genre. Mais je vais garder un œil ouvert.${prompt}
  11495: Un pickpocket ? J'ai des affaires plus importantes à régler ! Demandez à quelqu'un d'autre.${prompt}
  11496: Un pickpocket, dites-vous ? Hmm... Maintenant que j'y pense, j'ai aperçu une femme étrange courir sur le pont là-bas il y a peu.${prompt}
  11497: Elle a couru vers cette porte, ce qui signifie qu'elle pourrait être sur le terrain de parade maintenant.${prompt}
  11498: Un pickpocket ? Je me demande si vous parlez de cette dame qui courait comme une folle tout à l'heure...${prompt}
  11499: Un pickpocket ? J'ai effectivement vu une femme peu digne tout à l'heure. Elle courait vers la porte de Ranperre.${prompt}
  11500: Cette partie de la ville est si animée, j'aime bien regarder tout le monde vaquer à ses occupations.${prompt}
  11501: Un pickpocket ?${prompt}
  11502: Eh bien, j'ai vu un étranger. Elle a couru vers la porte là-bas à l'instant.${prompt}
  11503: Un pickpocket ? Peut-être que c'était cette femme grossière tout à l'heure. Elle m'a traité de “barde idiot” ! Inconcevable !${prompt}
  11504: Bonjour. Je suis Ulycille. Vous vous intéressez à la menuiserie ?${prompt}
  11505: Les menuisiers de San d'Oria sont bénis par une abondance de matières premières, car notre royaume est entouré de collines boisées.${prompt}
  11506: 'Si vous cherchez à perfectionner votre compétence en menuiserie, écoutez ce conseil : San d''Oria est l’endroit idéal pour commencer !${prompt}'
  11507: Un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Ceci est l'un des meilleurs ateliers du pays. Bien sûr, beaucoup dépend de vous.${prompt}
  11508: Si vous souhaitez affiner votre compétence, fabriquez la même chose encore et encore. Travaillez dur, et vous pourriez être connu parmi nous.${prompt}
  11509: Dites, avez-vous entendu ?${prompt}
  11510: À propos des princes ? Qui ne l'a pas entendu ? Les choses empirent, à ce qu'on dit !${prompt}
  11511: Oui, mais j'ai plus confiance en le Prince Trion qu'en le Prince Pieuje. Il est l'aîné, et le plus fort des deux.${prompt}
  11512: Oh, il est tout en muscles et sans cervelle, inapte à décider du sort de notre royaume. Personnellement, je suivrais le Prince Pieuje.${prompt}
  11513: Est-ce que je me trompe, ou y a-t-il plus d'étrangers en ville ces jours-ci ? Qu'est-ce que cela peut bien signifier ?${prompt}
  11514: Quoi, vous n'avez pas entendu ? Ils recrutent des aventuriers en masse !${prompt}
  11515: J'entends dire qu'ils prennent n'importe qui--même des étrangers !${prompt}
  11516: Eh bien, devinez ce qui m'est arrivé. Je rangeais la maison hier, quand un homme étrange est entré. Il a ensuite couru dehors par la véranda sans même dire bonjour !${prompt}
  11517: Honte à ces aventuriers ! Ils pourraient au moins frapper avant de s'introduire dans nos maisons.${prompt}
  11518: Êtes-vous une nouvelle recrue ? Bonjour, je suis Matildie.${prompt}
  11519: Vous avez l'air gentil--bien plus gentil que les autres aventuriers. N'oubliez pas, demandez de l'aide si vous perdez votre chemin !${prompt}
  11520: 'Pourquoi ne pas vous donner un peu d’argent pour votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} là, juste pour bien commencer. Dépensez-le sagement !${prompt}'
  11521: Si vous perdez votre chemin, consultez simplement votre “Carte” depuis le menu principal.${prompt}
  11522: Adieu, et bonne chance !${prompt}
  11523: Au revoir !${prompt}
  11524: "Ces écluses divisent le Nord de San d'Oria en deux parties : le Terrain de Parade et le Chemin des Ouvriers.${prompt}"
  11525: "Le Chemin des Ouvriers est bien plus bas que le reste de la ville. Ainsi, pour éviter les inondations, nous utilisons ces écluses pour réguler l'eau de tout le quartier !${prompt}"
  11526: Attendez, vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? J'ai une demande, si vous avez le temps...${prompt}
  11527: Ne le dites à personne, mais quelqu'un m'a envoyé une lettre disant qu'il avait empoisonné l'eau ici ! Nous vérifions maintenant la véracité de cette affirmation.${prompt}
  11528: En attendant, nous devons préparer un neutralisant pour éliminer le poison. Seriez-vous prêt à en obtenir un ?${prompt}

  12465: I will never get there, so let me tell you where you can fish for the big one. They say he's in Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  12466: 'If you take a renowned fisherman with you, then you should offer him something. At the very least, you should give five ${item-plural: 0[2]} or so.${prompt}'
  12467: But if you are to fish for him yourself, you should catch him easily, as long as you've had a little practice. After all, fishing is all about patience!${prompt}
  12468: If you do catch the big one, watch out! They say he's one feisty fish. Your skills in swordsmanship will be of greater use than those of fishing, I gather.${prompt}
  12469: I have uncovered all of this, yet I cannot go myself. Please, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madam], catch him in my stead!${prompt}
  12470: They say that you can catch the big one in Castle Oztroja. It would be foul if someone caught him before you!${prompt}
  12471: What? You caught the big one? Amazing! I doubt I could have done the same.${prompt}
  12472: Now, hurry and get it cleaned! I have heard of an expert fisherman in Selbina. You should find him and ask him!${prompt}
  12473: Wow! Such a thing was inside its gizzard? Surely I would never have caught him, for he gave even you a run for your money.${prompt}
  12474: Father, how could you forget this sword?${prompt}
  12475: What? Vilbert is in league with the Orcs? Hah! What nonsense!${prompt}
  12476: I will not fall for such a joke so easily. Vilbert is taking me fishing in Jugner Forest. Be not surprised if I catch a bigger fish than the big one!${prompt}
  12477: You saw, did you not? My father is a mighty knight! I wish to become like him!${prompt}
  12478: Father promised to take me fishing! But I know that he is a much greater swordsman than a fisher.${prompt}
  12479: 'Now I shall prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that you gave me.${prompt}'
  12480: Behold the beauty of this cathedral. We failed to protect it once, but never again.${prompt}
  12481: Narcheral, I bring news!${prompt}
  12482: What!? Are you certain?${prompt}
  12483: Yes.${prompt}
  12484: They are massing by the hundreds!? I-Impossible!${prompt}
  12485: At any rate, you must return and continue the investigation.${prompt}
  12486: Adventurer, I have a request. Depart at once for the western borders of Valkurm Dunes. Find the messenger of the dark stalkers there, but only at night.${prompt}
  12487: 'Defeat the dark stalker and take its ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  12488: If the reports are correct, the dead of Tavnazia are returning. This is dire news, indeed!${prompt}
  12489: 'Yes, this is indeed ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Our worst nightmare has come true.${prompt}'
  12490: This is for you. I foresee I will need your help yet again...${prompt}
  12491: Excellent work, my friend. This is what I promised. We can only await Prince Pieuje's decision now.${prompt}
  12492: Why, I heard an adventurer smote Marquis Altedour, but to think it was you!${prompt}
  12493: Prince Pieuje disappoints me for his failure to act. I would have suggested that he claim credit for the defeat of the marquis.${prompt}
  12494: I saw in him a more luminous mind. I suppose royalty will never know how secure one's position is in society.${prompt}
  12495: Oh, please disregard my musings. You have done us a great service, and for that you should be rewarded.${prompt}
  12496: Say, are you an adventurer?${prompt}
  12497: My name is Rochefogne, and I am an adventurer, too. I have just arrived at San d'Oria...${prompt}
  12498: And already I am struck at how little has changed! Time has no dominion over this city.${prompt}
  12499: Can you see the great cathedral yonder? Faithful San d'Orians gather there still in worship to the Goddess of the Dawn.${prompt}
  12500: And behold its balcony! Could the papsque still rise there to grant benedictions?${prompt}
  12501: Hmm? And they must be Royal Knights...${prompt}
  12502: Swiftly do they return to Chateau d'Oraguille, surely from some expedition abroad...${prompt}
  12503: You, too, must learn the difference between the Temple Knights and the Royal Knights, if you are to bear San d'Orian citizenship!${prompt}
  12504: The Temple Knights shield the capital, while the Royal Knights strike at our foes!${prompt}
  12505: I heard mention in my travels that Prince Trion had assumed control of the Royal Knights.${prompt}
  12506: Yes, Trion... Of him I have heard naught for ages. I do hope the princes are well.${prompt}
  12507: And Princess Claidie! Fair is said to be the younger sister of Trion and Pieuje. Perhaps someday I may meet her!${prompt}
  12508: But, I ramble. Many pardons!${prompt}
  12509: So long have I been away that my head races. Please, let me hear your questions.${prompt}
  12510: |-
    What would you ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing in particular.
    I want to go outside and fight.
    I want to shop.
    I want to know about adventuring.${prompt}
  12511: Should you wish to leave the city from here in Northern San d'Oria, you must pass through Ranperre Gate to the west.${prompt}
  12512: You surely must have a map of this city, but hear my directions anyway.${prompt}
  12513: First, walk west from the Parade Grounds upon which we now stand.${prompt}
  12514: Pass through the gate, and follow the road past the furniture shop and the inn.${prompt}
  12515: Take the gate on your left, and make another left down the stairs. Soon Ranperre Gate will rise before you.${prompt}
  12516: Shopping? Well, at the auction houses and bazaar are goods from other adventurers. But let me tell you of the shops I frequent.${prompt}
  12517: For weaponry, ask at the weapon shop in the northwest corner of Northern San d'Oria. Upon your map is written a sword. That is the place.${prompt}
  12518: For armor, walk south into Southern San d'Oria. Check your map for the shop marked with a shirt of mail.${prompt}
  12519: If you seek magic, go northwest. Near the Carpenters' Guild is the gate that opens to Port San d'Oria. Look for a scroll on your map to find the magic shop.${prompt}
  12520: For money, townsfolk may give you a reward for helping them. You could also hunt monsters and sell the bounty to merchants in town.${prompt}
  12521: Spoken like an adventurer! What do you seek to know?${prompt}
  12522: |-
    What do you seek to know?
    ${selection-lines}
    Helping people.
    Hunting monsters.
    Easy money.
    Finding work.${prompt}
  12523: Aider les gens, hein ? Maintenant que j'y pense, j'ai vu une dame faire les cent pas devant une maison à Southern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12524: Peut-être pourriez-vous l'aider. Elle devrait encore être là, sur le chemin de Pikeman.${prompt}
  12525: Traversez l'Arc de la Victoire derrière vous pour entrer dans Southern San d'Oria. Ensuite, ouvrez votre carte et trouvez le chemin.${prompt}
  12526: Vous semblez sûr de vous. Je suis grandement soulagé.${prompt}
  12527: Maintenant que j'y pense, un marchand devant la Guilde des Tanneurs à Southern San d'Oria m'a demandé de rassembler des peaux.${prompt}
  12528: Peut-être pourriez-vous le faire à la place ? Traversez l'Arc de la Victoire derrière vous pour entrer dans Southern San d'Oria. Puis, dirigez-vous vers l'ouest pour atteindre la Guilde des Tanneurs.${prompt}
  12529: Les nouvelles armes et armures peuvent coûter une fortune.${prompt}
  12530: Mais, hmm... Ah, oui. Je vous recommande de voir les menuisiers sur le chemin de Laborman. Ils pourraient avoir quelque chose pour vous.${prompt}
  12531: Le chemin de Laborman se trouve au nord-ouest de nous. Passez devant le magasin de meubles et l'auberge, puis prenez la porte à droite. Le chemin de Laborman s'ouvre sous cette porte.${prompt}
  12532: Pour faire avancer la gloire de San d'Oria, vous devriez entreprendre des missions données par les postes de garde.${prompt}
  12533: Elles ne paient pas, mais vous pouvez gagner des points de rang en preuve de vos contributions à notre royaume.${prompt}
  12534: Avec suffisamment de points de rang, votre rang augmentera.${prompt}
  12535: Et avec un rang plus élevé viennent de plus grandes opportunités. Ceux de haut rang se voient confier des tâches qui décident du destin du Royaume !${prompt}
  12536: 'Maintenant, vous feriez mieux de vous mettre en route. Aventurez-vous fièrement pour San d’Oria, et votre ${choice: 6}[épée/épée/poings/bâton/bâton/épée/lame] ne faillira jamais !${prompt}'
  12537: 'Comprenez-vous ? Aventurez-vous fièrement pour San d’Oria, et votre ${choice: 6}[épée/épée/poings/bâton/bâton/épée/lame] ne faillira jamais !${prompt}'
  12538: 'Est-ce ainsi ? Eh bien, aventurez-vous fièrement pour San d’Oria, et votre ${choice: 6}[épée/épée/poings/bâton/bâton/épée/lame] ne faillira jamais !${prompt}'
  12539: Oh, avant que j'oublie... Je vous donne ceci pour vos voyages. Montrez-le à Matildie, qui se tient devant le pont-levis du Château d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  12540: Cependant, connaissez-vous notre tradition concernant le legs d'objets ? Avant de donner à autrui, nous ouvrons le menu principal et sélectionnons "Échanger".${prompt}
  12541: N'hésitez pas à demander de l'aide à d'autres aventuriers.${prompt}
  12542: Maintenant, je dois aller chercher l'entrée du château. Puissions-nous nous rencontrer à nouveau, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  12543: Oh, un aventurier. Si vous êtes ici pour le sermon sur les Portes du Paradis, adressez-vous au frère qui se tient au narthex.${prompt}
  12544: Vous dites que vous venez au nom des Chevaliers du Temple ? Et vous voulez en savoir plus sur Tedimout ?${prompt}
  12545: Que Altana vous bénisse ! Oui, Tedimout était un frère en formation.${prompt}
  12546: Souvent, il entrait dans les bois de Ronfaure à la recherche de plantes sauvages pour la préparation de thé et de médicaments.${prompt}
  12547: Je l'ai toujours mis en garde contre le fait d'y aller seul, car les arbres peuvent cacher des prédateurs... et pire encore !${prompt}
  12548: Il prétendait que les robes bleues du clergé le protégeraient.${prompt}
  12549: Mais il semble que sa foi était mal placée. Je crains que les Orcs ne l'aient pris !${prompt}
  12550: L'horreur qu'il doit affronter maintenant... Chaque matin et soir, je prie la Déesse de l'Aube de le délivrer de leurs griffes !${prompt}
  12551: Pourquoi, le Prince Pieuje ! Et le Papsque Shamonde !${prompt}
  12552: Vicasque Arnau, je suis venu vous parler de l'acolyte disparu. Il semble que sa disparition ne soit pas due aux Orcs après tout.${prompt}
  12553: C'est exact, Votre Altesse. J'ai entendu dire que Tedimout allait parfois dans la forêt pour chercher des herbes.${prompt}
  12554: Ne tirons pas de conclusions hâtives. Peut-être que Tedimout est parti seul... pour une longue randonnée, par exemple ! Les Chevaliers du Temple ne sont envoyés qu'en cas exceptionnel. Nous devons d'abord en savoir plus !${prompt}
  12555: Vous dites vrai, Votre Sainteté. La citadelle ne peut être vidée de ses Chevaliers du Temple pour une cause si incertaine.${prompt}
  12556: Je comprends, bien sûr. Cependant... Si Tedimout a effectivement été enlevé par des Orcs, nous ne pourrions tout de même pas le laisser mourir, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12557: Non, bien sûr que non. J'ai décidé d'envoyer un aventurier. Si ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] découvre que les Orcs détiennent le garçon, alors les Chevaliers du Temple seront là pour le récupérer.${prompt}
  12558: Je comprends, Votre Altesse. Je suis très reconnaissant.${prompt}
  12559: Au fait, avec qui avez-vous discuté ?${prompt}
  12560: Votre Altesse, ${name-player} est ici en mission de la part du chevalier à la porte. ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] est venu(e) demander des informations sur Tedimout.${prompt}
  12561: Eh bien, parfait. Je vais vous ordonner d'entreprendre cette mission.${prompt}
  12562: Infiltrez Ghelsba et déterminez si Tedimout y est retenu captif. J'ai entendu dire qu'ils gardent des prisonniers dans une petite hutte quelque part.${prompt}
  12563: Une fois que vous savez, informez un Chevalier du Temple. Maintenant, allez !${prompt}
  12564: Vous avez ma gratitude éternelle pour avoir sauvé Tedimout !${prompt}
  12565: Merci, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  12566: Tout ce que je peux faire, c'est prier pour les aventuriers. S'il vous plaît, laissez-moi prier pour vous aussi.${prompt}
  12567: Que la lumière éclaire votre chemin, et que les Portes du Paradis s'ouvrent pour vous !${prompt}
  12568: Alors, Tedimout est revenu... Maudit aventurier !${prompt}
  12569: Nous pourrons négocier avec les Orcs une fois que nous saurons ce qu'ils veulent, mais je déteste l'idée d'envoyer des Chevaliers du Temple en reconnaissance.${prompt}
  12570: Ce frère impulsif refuse de penser de manière pragmatique. Nos recherches à travers les siècles prouvent que les Portes du Paradis s'ouvriront bientôt !${prompt}
  12571: Et pourtant, il reste sourd à nos propos ! Votre Altesse, je crains que nous ne restions à la traîne des autres nations.${prompt}
  12572: Je comprends. Nous devons d'abord découvrir ce que les Orcs savent sur les portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  12573: Ils sont devenus audacieux ces derniers temps. Certains disent que leur influence s'étend jusqu'à la Tombe du Roi Ranperre et aux Grottes d'Ordelle.${prompt}
  12574: Hm ? Quelqu'un est là ?${prompt}
  12575: Comment osez-vous ! Espionner le papsque pendant qu'il reçoit le prince !${prompt}
  12576: Non, ce n'est pas grave, Votre Sainteté.${prompt}
  12577: Vous êtes venu livrer le rapport, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, voyons cela.${prompt}
  12578: Alors... Les Orcs cherchent quelque chose. Nous ne pouvons dire ce que c'est. Cela nécessite des investigations supplémentaires.${prompt}
  12579: Hmph.${prompt}
  12580: Merci, ${name-player}. J'informerai le chevalier de la porte que votre mission est accomplie.${prompt}
  12581: Oh, vous êtes de retour. Eh bien, si vous êtes si heureux d'avoir vaincu un ou deux Orcs, vous avez encore du chemin à parcourir !${prompt}
  12582: Pour un nouveau venu, je serais... Hmm ?${prompt}
  12583: Seigneur chevalier, pardonnez cette interruption, mais il y a quelque chose que je dois vous demander.${prompt}
  12584: Je me demande si la reine Leaute est vraiment décédée il y a quinze ans. Dites-moi, de quoi est-elle morte ?${prompt}
  12585: Qui êtes-vous, et pourquoi vous mêlez-vous de telles questions ?${prompt}
  12586: S'il vous plaît, j'ai voyagé de loin pour voir Sa Majesté !${prompt}
  12587: Quoi !?${prompt}
  12588: Très bien. Écoutez attentivement. Il y a quinze ans, la reine Leaute a succombé à une maladie rare. Elle a quitté ce monde avant que nous puissions la sauver.${prompt}
  12589: Ah, donc une maladie a emporté sa vie.${prompt}
  12590: Eh bien, cela ne vous concerne pas de toute façon. Même si elle était en vie, un aventurier comme vous ne pourrait jamais la voir, encore moins entrer dans le Château d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  12591: Er...${prompt}
  12592: Quel était le nom de sa maladie ?${prompt}
  12593: On ne nous dit pas de telles choses. Seule la famille royale le saurait.${prompt}
  12594: Ah bon ? Eh bien, je vous remercie pour votre gentillesse, fier chevalier de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12595: Hé, attends !${prompt}
  12596: Qu'est-ce qui n'allait pas avec cet aventurier ? Il était incroyablement têtu, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12597: Il semblait connaître la défunte reine personnellement, mais comment ne pouvait-il pas être au courant de sa mort ?${prompt}
  12598: En tout cas, votre travail est terminé. Excellent travail, mon ami !${prompt}
  12599: Quoi, tu veux la mission du rang un à nouveau ?${prompt}
  12600: 'Je savais que tu reviendrais sain et sauf, et avec le ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission accomplie !${prompt}'
  12601: As-tu déjà mis les pieds dans la tombe du roi Ranperre ?${prompt}
  12602: Il y a deux cents ans, le rideau est tombé sur l'âge d'or de San d'Oria. Une guerre civile a éclaté pour la domination du Royaume.${prompt}
  12603: Le roi Ranperre était là pour éteindre le conflit. Quand il est mort, il a été enterré dans une grande tombe au sud de la Forêt de l'Est.${prompt}
  12604: Mais des mains inconnues ont profané sa tombe ces derniers temps.${prompt}
  12605: Les visiteurs signalent des pierres tombales disparues et des ombres se tordant dans les cavernes. Profaner la tombe d'un roi est un crime impardonnable !${prompt}
  12606: Vos ordres sont d'enquêter sur la tombe et de déterminer s'il y a du vrai dans ce qu'ils disent. Comprenez-vous ?${prompt}
  12607: |-
    Accepter la mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'accepte.
    Je n'accepte pas.${prompt}
  12608: Je vous implore de vous rendre rapidement à la Tombe de Ranperre. Vous pourriez y trouver des preuves de pilleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  12609: Mais ne vous aventurez pas trop profondément, sinon les Gobelins pourraient vous trouver. Marchez hardiment, mon ami, mais ne vous surestimez pas !${prompt}
  12610: Les visiteurs signalent des pierres tombales manquantes et des ombres se tordant dans les cavernes. Parcourez la tombe et déterminez s'ils disent la vérité.${prompt}
  12611: Dépêchez-vous de vous rendre à la Tombe de Ranperre. Vous pourriez y trouver des preuves de pilleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  12612: Avez-vous vraiment fouillé la tombe ?${prompt}
  12613: Alors, vous avez obtenu cela des chauves-souris dans la Tombe de Ranperre ?${prompt}
  12614: Vous voyez, cela appartenait en fait à un Orque. Que pourraient vouloir les Orques avec la tombe ?${prompt}
  12615: Quoi qu'il en soit, votre mission est terminée. Ne parlez de cela à personne.${prompt}
  12616: Ah, le recrue est de retour ? Je suis désolé, mais je n'ai pas le temps pour vous aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  12617: Je sais que vous avez fait tout ce chemin, mais je ne peux pas vous aider en ce moment.${prompt}
  12618: Oh, qui est-ce que je trompe ? Bien sûr, je pourrais utiliser votre aide !${prompt}
  12619: N'avez-vous pas entendu ? Les Orques sont venus et ont enlevé des enfants ! Nous pensons qu'ils les retiennent dans leur repaire à Ghelsba.${prompt}
  12620: Il n'y a pas longtemps, une mauvaise nouvelle est venue de la cathédrale. Un garçon en formation pour devenir frère s'est approché de Ghelsba et n'est pas revenu. Son nom était Tedimout.${prompt}
  12621: Les Chevaliers Royaux marcheraient à son secours, mais le Prince Trion est au nord, et ne peut donner l'ordre.${prompt}
  12622: Le Prince Pieuje est en délibérations sérieuses pour savoir s'il doit envoyer les Chevaliers du Temple à la place. Il semble que ses efforts soient concentrés sur le sauvetage des enfants, mais...${prompt}
  12623: Mais peu importe. Nous avons besoin de connaître l'ennemi. Vous devez visiter la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  12624: Un garçon en formation pour devenir frère s'est approché de Ghelsba et n'est pas revenu. Son nom était Tedimout.${prompt}
  12625: Les Chevaliers du Temple pourraient être mobilisés bientôt. Vous devez visiter la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  12626: Le Prince Trion vient de m'informer de votre travail. Vous avez fait un excellent travail.${prompt}
  12627: En raison de votre contribution exemplaire, ${name-player}, San d'Oria vous reconnaît comme un aventurier de rang deux.${prompt}
  12628: Mais ne laissez pas cela vous monter à la tête. Ce certificat n'est valable qu'à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12629: Travaillez dur et de meilleures choses viendront, mon ami. Un jour, votre nom sera connu de nos alliés également.${prompt}
  12630: Oh, et une chose de plus. Le vicaire de la cathédrale a dit qu'il voulait vous remercier au nom du garçon.${prompt}
  12631: Vous obtenez le rang deux.${prompt}
  12632: Quoi qu'il en soit, vous avez bien accompli la mission. Il est temps d'avoir une récompense !${prompt}
  12633: Je vous attribue des points de rang correspondant à votre réussite.${prompt}
  12634: Le Prince Trion a ordonné aux éclaireurs des Chevaliers Royaux de se rendre à Davoi, tandis que le Prince Pieuje a ordonné aux éclaireurs des Chevaliers du Temple. C'est comme si la main droite ne savait pas ce que fait la gauche !${prompt}
  12635: Monarlais Halver est furieux, mais il a d'abord besoin d'informations. Vous devez trouver l'éclaireur des Chevaliers du Temple, recevoir son rapport d'éclaireur et retourner ce rapport à monarlais.${prompt}
  12636: 'Quoi ? On vous a dit de remettre le ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} au Prince Pieuje en personne ?${prompt}'
  12637: Eh bien, vous devriez trouver Son Altesse à la cathédrale.${prompt} 
  12638: 'Vous arrivez juste au bon moment ! Le Prince Trion veut vous parler. Il semble avoir entendu parler de vous lorsque vous avez reçu votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12639: Rendez-vous aux chambres du Prince Trion à l'intérieur du Château d'Oraguille dès que vous êtes présentable !${prompt}
  12640: Le Prince Trion vous a appelé. Rendez-vous dans sa chambre à l'intérieur du Château d'Oraguille dès que vous êtes présentable !${prompt}
  12641: Je ne sais pas ce que le Prince Trion voulait que vous fassiez, mais allez jusqu'au bout ! Compris ?${prompt}
  12642: Bonjour. Ce n'est pas le moment pour des missions ; le Château d'Oraguille a été visité par des bandits !${prompt}
  12643: Vous devez vous rendre au Château d'Oraguille rapidement ! Trouvez Dame Curilla, générale des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  12644: Des bandits infiltrant le Château d'Oraguille, c'est sans précédent dans l'histoire ! Dépêchez-vous de voir Dame Curilla, générale des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  12645: 'Oh, je veux mon ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'

    <Phssshooooowoooo>
    Vous n'avez jamais vu des Gobelins de l'au-delà ? Moi pas méchant. Moi vendre chips. Vous achetez. Utilisez avec cœur de pierre. Vous aurez de la chance !${prompt}
  12647: J'ai essayé d'importer des marchandises de Vollbow, mais c'est tellement difficile d'obtenir des articles provenant de zones qui ne sont pas sous contrôle de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12648: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Vous voulez en apprendre davantage sur les dragons ? Si seulement le Docteur Oiheaurese était...${prompt}
  12649: ...ici !${prompt}
  12650: Docteur, cet aventurier s'enquiert des dragons.${prompt}
  12651: Eh bien, notre aventurier est venu au bon endroit. Tout d'abord, jeune ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme], vous devez comprendre que là où il y a des dragons sacrés, il existe également des dragons du mal.${prompt}
  12652: Pourquoi, Sir Rahal. Qu'est-ce qui nous vaut l'honneur de votre présence aujourd'hui ?${prompt}
  12653: Rien d'urgent, Docteur. Je me demandais juste si quelque chose de particulier - des personnages suspects - avait été repéré dans cette zone récemment.${prompt}
  12654: Non... rien d'extraordinaire, monsieur.${prompt}
  12655: Je vois... Je pensais juste que... peut-être le corps de... son corps était... non...${prompt}
  12656: Continuez.${prompt}
  12657: Ahem ! Maintenant qu'il est parti, où en étais-je ?${prompt}
  12658: Ah, oui. Comme je le disais, il y a eu récemment une grande diminution du nombre de dragons nés à Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12659: C'est là que vous intervenez. Il y a une rumeur qu'un wyverne a pondu un œuf dans le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami.${prompt}
  12660: Je voudrais que vous excaviez l'œuf et que vous le protégiez des chasseurs de dragons.${prompt}
  12661: Pour éviter qu'ils ne tuent le wyverne alors qu'il est encore jeune, nous devons atteindre l'œuf avant eux.${prompt}
  12662: Le Docteur Oiheaurese a dit qu'un œuf de wyverne a été pondu au fond du Labyrinthe de Shakhrami. Cela pourrait-il être vrai ?${prompt}
  12663: |-
    Ah, it is you.
    I am sorry to inform you that Doctor Oiheaurese is not available at the moment. Perhaps he has taken ill. His work keeps him up late into the evening.${prompt}
  12664: Do you have business with the doctor? Well, he is currently away from the cathedral.${prompt}
  12665: And who might you be? I have not seen you around here before.${prompt}
  12666: My name is Yachemidot. I am what you would call a student of Doctor Oiheaurese.${prompt}
  12667: That egg? Is that really from a wyvern?${prompt}
  12668: How would you like to try hatching that egg? The doctor has told me that it would be dangerous, but I would like to give it a try. Any true scientist would feel the same way.${prompt}
  12669: And I just happen to know how to do it. Are you willing to help? You want to see it hatch too, don't you?${prompt}
  12670: |-
    Take part in Yachemidot's plan?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  12671: Wonderful! Take the egg and place it on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine located in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  12672: It's not that difficult! All you have to do is take the egg and place it on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine, which is located in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
  12673: If that wyvern has the holy crest, then there's a possibility that a new dragoon may be born!${prompt}
  12674: I've never heard the Doctor mention any Yachemidot. And what is all this with placing the egg on the far eastern tip of Drogaroga's Spine in the Meriphataud Mountains?${prompt}
  12675: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. You have come.
    The royal family requests your assistance.${prompt}
  12676: I can assume you have heard of the late King Ranperre's Lightbringer. If that sword were to fall into Orcish hands, San d'Oria would have her back against the wall.${prompt}
  12677: This situation must be prevented at any cost.${prompt}
  12678: We have Temple Knights participating in the search efforts, but there is an obvious lack of manpower.${prompt}
  12679: Our scholars have been combing through the ancient San d'Orian text you retrieved, searching for any new clues.${prompt}
  12680: I am confident they will find something.${prompt}
  12681: If only the cathedral's library had survived the fires of the Great War, we would not be so behind in our research on Lightbringer.${prompt}
  12682: Your Holiness!${prompt}
  12683: I apologize. You have a visitor...${prompt}
  12684: Mind you not. What is it, Morjean?${prompt}
  12685: Yes, Your Holiness. During the search of the library, we came across an ancient parchment hidden inside another book. Until now, we had passed it off as a poem written by someone long ago.${prompt}
  12686: However, after deciphering it, we realized it was a message reporting something hidden deep within the Bostaunieux Oubliette during the Great War.${prompt}
  12687: What? Could it be the holy sword, Lightbringer?${prompt}
  12688: We were unable to tell from the content of the parchment, but the fact remains that this item was hidden for a reason.${prompt}
  12689: Thank you for the update. You may leave now.${prompt}
  12690: We must report these new findings to the king immediately. This may shed some light on the whereabouts of Lightbringer.${prompt}
  12691: Prince Pieuje, what if we were to send ${name-player} to investigate?${prompt}
  12692: ${name-player} was the first to find the true resting place of King Ranperre, and has the trust of King Destin. I feel a preliminary search of the area is necessary before a full-scale survey is carried out. ${prompt}
  12693: Prince Pieuje! You must act before Prince Trion. Have you already forgotten the incident at King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt}
  12694: I understand your words, Your Holiness, but I feel it is my duty to first report these new findings to my father.${prompt}
  12695: 'Your Holiness.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12696: ${name-player}, will you journey into the Bostaunieux Oubliette and investigate the findings?${prompt}
  12697: On the outside, the prince may deny it, but on the inside, he is counting on your success in this mission.${prompt}
  12698: According to the newly deciphered parchment, scientists hid “something” down in the Bostaunieux Oubliette during the time of war. I want you to journey down there and find that something.${prompt}
  12699: I see... So you did not find Lightbringer. But what you have found is truly a possession of the lost Dragon King.${prompt}
  12700: Your Holiness, the Royal Knights sent to investigate the Bostaunieux Oubliette have returned. Their search turned up nothing.${prompt}
  12701: What is that!?${prompt}
  12702: Prince Pieuje, ${name-player} retrieved this stone tablet from deep within the oubliette.${prompt}
  12703: When the great King Ranperre brought the chaos in San d'Oria under control, it is said that his admonition was carved in stone.${prompt}
  12704: This may be that very tablet, my prince.${prompt}
  12705: I was correct in assuming that the Royal Knights would not be suited for a task such as this--one that requires perseverance.${prompt}
  12706: However, we cannot be sure that this tablet is King Ranperre's...${prompt}
  12707: Absolutely. There is still much deciphering that must be carried out by our scholars. It will require much more time.${prompt}
  12708: However, I promise you that I will make this task our top priority.${prompt}
  12709: As for the report on our finding of the tablet, I shall take the matter up with the king myself.${prompt}
  12710: And as for you, ${name-player}. Once the deciphering has been completed, we may have another task for you.${prompt}
  12711: Good day.${prompt}
  12712: You say you were under orders from the papsque? I am sorry for all the trouble he may have caused you.${prompt}
  12713: When it comes to the subject of Lightbringer, the papsque becomes a different man...${prompt}
  12714: I hereby conclude the coming-of-age ceremony of Claidie I d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  12715: So the baby princess has finally become a lady... Did you know that it is custom at the coming-of-age ceremony for the dark d'Oraguille secrets to be revealed?${prompt}
  12716: I'm sure you have already heard that during the Great War, the d'Oraguille family betrayed my father, Altedour, and dragged Tavnazia into ruin.${prompt}
  12717: Silence, infidel!${prompt}
  12718: Who are...${prompt}
  12719: Where did this vagrant come from!?${prompt}
  12720: No, I do not expect you to know who I am. This is the first time I have been to this cathedral.${prompt}
  12721: Wait, you look familiar. But you couldn't be...${prompt}
  12722: But I am. My name is Rochefogne I Tavnazia. Son of Altedour, and sole surviving heir to the Tavnazian throne.${prompt}
  12723: My mother's...brother!?${prompt}
  12724: Rochefogne!? You were slain in the Great War!${prompt}
  12725: You doubt your own eyes? Pitiful d'Oraguille. That will be the downfall of you all.${prompt}
  12726: 'Know this, d''Oraguilles: I will find Lightbringer. It is the destiny that drives me.${prompt}'
  12727: 'After him!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  12728: 'Stop, scoundrel!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  12729: 'Wait!${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  12730: That Rochefogne is a poison in our fair country. Dispatch the knights and have them comb the countryside--no, all of Vana'diel--for him!${prompt}
  12731: But how could it be...and what could he want with the holy sword...?${prompt}
  12732: Good day! Take a look at my selection from Li'Telor!${prompt}
  12733: Specialty goods from Vollbow! Specialty goods from Vollbow!${prompt}
  12734: |-
    <Sigh>
    Why must all craftsmen be so uptight?${prompt}
  12735: |-
    I wish to have a breastplate repaired at the Blacksmiths' Guild, but the people who work there are so difficult to approach...
    Would you mind coming with me?${prompt}
  12736: |-
    Go along?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, I'll go with you.
    I don't have time to hold your hand.${prompt}
  12737: |-
    You'll come?
    Thank you. I get so nervous sometimes!${prompt}
  12738: Excuse me... I would like to have this repaired. It's a keepsake from my father, but it's become a little weathered.${prompt}
  12739: |-
    Let's take a look...
    Ah, this is far too old to repair. You'd be better off buying a new one. We have a range of goods here, so why don't you go pick something out.${prompt}
  12740: I don't really want anything new, I just...${prompt}
  12741: Then you have no more business here. I'm sorry, miss, but I have better things to do than work on a relic like that.${prompt}
  12742: Oh, I see... Well, thank you for your time.${prompt}
  12743: |-
    That didn't go well at all.
    I appreciate you coming with me, though...${prompt}
  12744: |-
    Just a moment there, young lady.
    That's an interesting piece of armor you're carrying.
    Might I have a closer look?${prompt}
  12745: I, uh... Can I ask who you are, sir?${prompt}
  12746: Me? I am Ranchuriome, an unaffiliated blacksmith. I'm a craftsman that makes a scanty living taking on the jobs that the guild won't touch. Now, can I see that breastplate?${prompt}
  12747: I thought to have it repaired at the Blacksmiths' Guild, but they quite bluntly refused the job...${prompt}
  12748: And this is what you want to have fixed? Hmm... It's showing the passage of years, but I can see that it's been well cared for. This is well worth repairing. However...${prompt}
  12749: “However”? Will it be expensive?${prompt}
  12750: 'Not at all. This kind of thing I''d do for free. It''s just that for items of this age, you need special tools. If I had ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} from the Eastern Altepa Desert...${prompt}'
  12751: 'I...I hesitate to impose upon you again, but would it be at all possible for you to find me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}? Naturally, I will pay you for your troubles...${prompt}'
  12752: |-
    Accept the task?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  12753: |-
    Oh, that's a shame...
    Maybe there is someone else I can ask.${prompt}
  12754: |-
    Once you have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, I'll do the necessary repairs.
    Good day to you.${prompt}
  12755: "You'll help me? \nThank you. It would mean so much to me.${prompt}"
  12756: 'That''s all settled then. I''ll be here once you have the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} ready for me.${prompt}'
  12757: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} can be found in the Eastern Altepa Desert.
    Please take care on your travels!${prompt}
  12758: "So this is the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} that Ranchuriome was talking about. I am most grateful for your help. \nPlease accept this as payment.${prompt}"
  12759: Here, Ranchuriome. ${name-player} is the reason we have this!${prompt}
  12760: "Excellent! You managed to find one. Now I can start on those repairs. \nI'll have it ready for you by dinnertime.${prompt}"
  12761: I've really been feeling my years lately... No matter. I'm sure I'll perk up once I start working. I'll be back as soon as I'm done.${prompt}
  12762: I'm most grateful to you!${prompt}
  12763: You don't see many people with that kind of integrity around anymore. If my father was still alive, they would have struck up a solid friendship, I'm sure.${prompt}
  12764: Thanks to your help, my father's breastplate is looking like new, but... That nice old man, Ranchuriome, has passed away.${prompt}
  12765: I can't help but think it's my fault in some way...that the repairs he did for me were too strenuous. When I attended the funeral to pay my respects, though, his features seemed to be at peace.${prompt}
  12766: I attended Ranchuriome's funeral to pay my respects and express my thanks for his kindness.${prompt}
  12767: During the ceremony, I was distracted by an unusual lady among the mourners.${prompt}
  12768: Something about this woman seemed out of place. I tried to follow her after the funeral ended, but...${prompt}
  12769: I lost sight of her not long after.${prompt}
  12770: I searched around, trying to find her again. Instead, I came across Ranchuriome's son lying unconscious on the ground.${prompt}
  12771: |-
    I tended to his wound, and thankfully, he soon regained consciousness.
    I found this lying nearby.${prompt}
  12772: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} might be a clue as to what happened.${prompt}'
  12773: It's probably just my overactive imagination, but perhaps it will help in some way. Here. You should hold on to it, just in case.${prompt}
  12774: |-
    A suspicious woman and ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}...
    Probably just my overactive imagination.${prompt}
  12775: 'Oh, that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} came in handy after all? That''s wonderful! I''m glad I could help someone out in the same way that you and Ranchuriome helped me.${prompt}'
  12776: I don't think I'm suited for a career as a detective, though... I think I'll concentrate on helping people in a way that's more within my capabilities.${prompt}
  12777: My name is Charlaimagnat. I am engaged in the translation of ancient texts found in ruins across Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12778: 'Ah, you must be the adventurer, ${name-player}. I have recently received correspondence from Alfesar. I believe you have a letter and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for me.${prompt}'
  12779: As Alfesar reported in his letter, ancient magic is engraved upon this tablet.${prompt}
  12780: However, I will need more time to decipher all the text. I still cannot tell what magic this spell is for.${prompt}
  12781: Please return another day and I shall share with you what I have found. May Altana's providence guide you on your journey.${prompt}
  12782: Ah, ${name-player}. I have finished deciphering the spell. I give you my thanks for your assistance.${prompt}
  12783: Now that the text is translated, we can produce copies. I would like to offer you one in expression of our gratitude.${prompt}
  12784: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!${prompt}
  12785: Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.${prompt}

  12792: |-
    I can't talk about it too loudly, but have you ever seen one of those huge crystals?
    They're found all over the world, far into the wilderness, and deep down in dungeons...${prompt}

    From those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth.
    Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...${prompt}
  12794: Well, take a look at this!${prompt}
  12795: As a result of our research, we finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!${prompt}
  12796: |-
    Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money!
    However, they didn't appreciate being woken up, and attacked us.${prompt}
  12797: |-
    Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  12798: |-
    I'm sure that you could do it!
    Will you help us out with our research? ${prompt}
  12799: |-
    Take up the challenge?

    Bring it on!
    Ah, no, thanks...${prompt}

    But it didn't work properly?
    Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt}
  12875: |-
    ...Oh dear Goddess...
    Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt}
  12876: When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt}
  12877: Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt}

    Please take this.
    North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?${prompt}

    ...We m-m-meet again...
    ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...${prompt}

  12891: 'What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?${prompt}'

  12893: |-
    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  12894: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  12895: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  12896: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  12897: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  12898: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  12899: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  12900: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  12901: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  12902: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt}
  12903: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  12904: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  12905: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  12906: |-
    ...
    Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  12907: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  12908: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  12909: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  12910: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  12911: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  12912: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you''re ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  12913: 'The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt}'
  12914: |-
    I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.
    Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt}
  12915: 'Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt}'
  12916: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt}
  12917: |-
    Are you sure you are ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!

    You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt}
  12925: Ma'am!${prompt}
  12926: |-
    Hmmm...
    Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt}

  12934: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.${prompt}
  12935: You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?${prompt}
  12936: |-
    Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  12937: You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt}
  12938: Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt}
  12939: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt}
  12940: Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.${prompt}
  12941: Would you be interested in purchasing some adventurer-issue armor? Be careful when selecting, as we accept no refunds.${prompt}
  12942: Currently, the cathedral is conducting preparations for the Rites of Succession. If it were not for the outbreak at the coming-of-age ceremony, the services of the Temple Knights would not have been necessary...${prompt}
  12943: The responsibility of conducting such an important event has taken its toll on all of us here. Even His Holiness has been on edge as of late.${prompt}
  12944: I'm sorry ${choice-player-gender}[Lord/Lady] ${name-player}, but due to matters of security, I am not to allow anyone into the chateau until the Rites of Succession have taken place.${prompt}
  12945: |-
    I hereby declare the commencement of the Rites of Succession.
    The terms of selection will coincide with those found engraved on the recently discovered stone tablet of the Dragon King, Ranperre.${prompt}
  12946: “Light will befall the great Vana'diel only when the true heir of d'Oraguille raises Lightbringer to the heavens.”${prompt}
  12947: We shall now watch as the two princes attempt to draw forth the holy sword.${prompt}
  12948: Only then will it be known which is worthy to become our next king.${prompt}
  12949: Your Highness, have you any objections?${prompt}
  12950: I have none. Continue with the ceremony.${prompt}
  12951: Prince Trion, come forth...${prompt}
  12952: 'Wait!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12953: |-
    Who goes there!?
    Are you oblivious to the events that are transpiring here today?${prompt}
  12954: I am completely aware! That is why I have come!${prompt}
  12955: Coteaulepoint? What has come over you?${prompt}
  12956: |-
    No... That voice...
    You are none other than the rogue, Rochefogne!${prompt}
  12957: I could care less of this play you perform for your own amusement. I have come for one reason, and one reason only--to take Lightbringer.${prompt}
  12958: You should be dead! What is the meaning of this!?${prompt}
  12959: Hah. If you refer to the assassins you sent to kill me, you may be able to find them...at the bottom of the Bastore Sea.${prompt}
  12960: Their hidden identities only assisted me in erasing them, unnoticed, from the face of Vana'diel. And that is how I was successful in crashing your little party.${prompt}
  12961: If you do not wish to see your lovely sister's head rolling on the floor, you had best hand over Lightbringer.${prompt}
  12962: Why, you...${prompt}
  12963: |-
    As you wish, Rochefogne.
    On the count of three, I will throw you the holy sword, and you shall let the princess go.${prompt}
  12964: One...${prompt}
  12965: Two...${prompt}
  12966: 'THREE!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12967: A wise decision, Trion.${prompt}
  12968: |-
    I need not your praise.
    But perhaps you may enlighten us--how do you plan to escape whilst surrounded by our Royal Knights?${prompt}
  12969: Compared to what I have gone through to get this sword, escaping from this place will be child's play.${prompt}
  12970: And what if the sword you hold is not the true Lightbringer?${prompt}
  12971: |-
    What?
    Why, you...!${prompt}
  12972: We had been expecting you all along. When your body did not turn up, we assumed that you were still out there, planning your next move. However, we did not expect that you would be posing as one of our own men.${prompt}
  12973: Ugh...${prompt}
  12974: Now has come the time to end your life--and the darkness that lurks about it. Come forth, O Lightbringer!${prompt}
  12975: 'Trion! No!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12976: 'Claidie, now!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12977: We cannot let Lightbringer fall into the hands of those fiends!${prompt}
  12978: |-
    What is going on here?
    Where is Lightbringer!?${prompt}
  12979: Why!? The sword was unsheathed, but the Gates of Paradise did not open!${prompt}
  12980: The Gates of Paradise...?${prompt}
  12981: Hah! You know nothing of what that sword can do.${prompt}
  12982: That sword is the evil weapon that destroyed my country...${prompt}
  12983: How do you know this?${prompt}
  12984: I know this only because it was I who drew Lightbringer and brought an end to my homeland.${prompt}
  12985: It cannot be!${prompt}
  12986: Now is not the time to explain. However, Trion, you now know why I must reseal the holy sword.${prompt}
  12987: When I removed Lightbringer from its sheathe, it felt as if I had all of Vana'diel in the palm of my hand...as if all other life on this planet was useless...${prompt}
  12988: Had your sister not thrown the dreamrose pollen at you, you would have most certainly been consumed by the power of the sword.${prompt}
  12989: We must retrieve Lightbringer from the grasp of the Orcs, then return it to its proper resting place in King Ranperre's Tomb. If we do not, another country may vanish from the face of...Vana'diel...${prompt}
  12990: Rochefogne!?${prompt}
  12991: Then Lightbringer is not a bringer of light, but a bringer of darkness...?${prompt}
  12992: |-
    Trion! Trion!
    Did you not hear Rochefogne? We must send our knights immediately!${prompt}
  12993: '...${prompt}'
  12994: |-
    Trion! Get a hold of yourself!
    Rahal! Ready the Royal Knights and track down those Orcs!
    Curilla! Double the patrols of the Temple Knights in the city!
    As for the rest of you--let us retreat to the castle so we can plan our next move. Dismissed!${prompt}
  12995: |-
    As for you, Shamonde...
    I have a few questions...${prompt}
  12996: Was it our lack of faith that brought this time of despair upon us?${prompt}
  12997: The papsque is currently being held at the Chateau d'Oraguille for questioning on the matters at hand. I have never seen His Holiness so disturbed...${prompt}
  12998: Other than those who attended, none know of what took place at the Rites of Succession. However, I must be strong, as not to bring worry upon the members of our faith.${prompt}
  12999: |-
    ${name-player}...
    I see you have same the doubts as I.${prompt}
  13000: We would like to see the papsque in private.${prompt}
  13001: Your Highness, I have been given strict orders to not allow anyone near His Holiness without the accompaniment of a Temple Knight...${prompt}
  13002: |-
    I understand your orders. It was I who gave them.
    Now step aside. I will take all responsibility for any actions taken by the papsque.${prompt}
  13003: Yes, Your Highness.${prompt}
  13004: Your...Holiness.${prompt}
  13005: Prince Pieuje...${prompt}
  13006: May I ask you one question? Why did you have my brother draw Lightbringer and open the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
  13007: |-
    The Gates of Paradise...
    When the war came to a close and I saw with my own eyes what was left of Tavnazia, I was convinced that the only way to save the world was by finding and opening those gates.${prompt}
  13008: But what exactly are the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
  13009: I searched hundreds of works of literature... However, the true meaning of the Gates of Paradise remained a mystery.${prompt}
  13010: I was about to abandon my search, when one day, the Archduke of Jeuno's younger brother visited me here in this cathedral. It was then that he told me how Lightbringer was the key to opening the gates.${prompt}
  13011: Lord Eald'narche?${prompt}
  13012: But if it was not true, why would he say such a thing...? To think that Lightbringer could be the cause of so much pain and suffering...${prompt}
  13013: Now I have finally realized that the true Gates of Paradise lie not in some fantasy world, but here in our hearts. And perhaps it is time that I unlock the gates in mine...${prompt}
  13014: Paradise lies within our hearts...${prompt}
  13015: While my soul is still heavy with the sins I have committed against this great kingdom, His Highness has granted me amnesty.${prompt}
  13016: From this day forth, until the day I stand before the Goddess for judgement, I will concentrate my prayers on bringing hope to all those on Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13017: |-
    I will believe your words, but from this day forth, I wish to take my own path to Paradise.
    I pray that both our dreams be fulfilled.${prompt}
  13018: |-
    The papsque has returned from Chateau d'Oraguille and will now pay penitence for his sins.
    He will be allowed to perform his normal duties, however, a Temple Knight escort will accompany him when leaving the cathedral.${prompt}
  13019: Perhaps the time to reconsider the role of the Gates to Paradise is upon us. May the knowledge of the papsque's sins guide us to a better path.${prompt}

    People are wallowing in sin...
    There are so many weak-spirited heathens who cannot go a day without lying, cheating, or stealing from their fellows.${prompt}

  13092: |-
    And now...
    Let us assume an item thou hast obtained in your lust for material possession has been warped by the wrath of the spirits.${prompt}
  13093: These items are in a cursed state. Useless items that, if left to their own devices, will bring down upon thee a terrible fate. That curse shall remain until the spirits are appeased by the acquisition of an “abjuration.”${prompt}
  13094: An abjuration is the one and only key capable of quieting the spirits and removing the curse. It requires great hardship and suffering to obtain one; however, this penance is necessary for the cleansing of thy soul.${prompt}
  13095: If thou bringst unto me a cursed item and its opposing abjuration, I shall invoke the blessing of the Goddess and remove thy curse.${prompt}
  13096: Thou needst not hasten thy steps. When the time is right, thou shalt hear more of curses and abjurations.${prompt}
  13097: Until that time, it is best that thou forgettest what thou hast learned and be on thy way. May the Gates of Paradise open unto thee.${prompt}
  13098: This is most unfortunate... However, if thou hast not the appropriate abjuration to counter the curse, then I may not perform the purification ceremony. When thou hast obtained the abjuration, come once again to my side.${prompt}
  13099: Verily, this is the abjuration that is required. Thou hast done well. If thou bringst the opposing cursed item, I shall perform the purification ceremony forthwith.${prompt}
  13100: Hmm? Ah, my apologies, I was lost in thought. Was there something I could aid you with, my child?${prompt}
  13101: Praise to the Goddess! Thou hast safely returned from the trial of the spirits. Let us perform the purification ceremony at once. At my urging, raise thy hand in supplication to the heavens.${prompt}
  13102: "Great Goddess Altana. \nIn recognition of the penance ${name-player} has paid, I beg thee to remove the blight upon the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and absolve ${name-player} of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] sin...${prompt}"

  13107: ${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}! Much I have heard of your noble efforts on the battlefield. If it is not too much of a bother, your assistance is requested for a special mission.${prompt}
  13108: The mission requires escorting the noble young missus Lady Cannau, the only daughter of a highly respectable family. However, she is--how would you say--a tad rambunctious. Embarrassed I am to report that we have already had many a proud adventurer quit this task the moment they met her.${prompt}
  13109: If you have courage enough to take on this adventure, travel to the Eldieme Necropolis. Whether Lady Cannau is there or not is another question...${prompt}
  13110: |-
    You shall be compensated generously upon the completion of your task.
    Good luck and Godspeed.${prompt}

    Good day, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].
    I am with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (AMAN) and am now taking applications for new ${color: 5}mentors${color: 1}.${prompt}
  13140: |-
    What is a mentor, you ask?
    Well, in short, a mentor is an experienced adventurer who is willing to offer some of their time to help out their less traveled companions.${prompt}
  13141: If this sounds like the job for you, then feel free to sign up today.${prompt}
  13142: 'To become a mentor, you must have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  13143: 'Accepting ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} requires that you have over 180 hours of play time...${prompt}'
  13144: '...and have completed the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082828080}.${prompt}'
  13145: Please note that registering and serving as a mentor, as well as utilizing the services of the Mentor Program, are to be done at the player's own discretion.${prompt}
  13146: SQUARE ENIX will not be held responsible for the actions and/or comments of any mentors. No benefits of any kind will be provided to those who choose to participate in the Mentor Program.${prompt}
  13147: When you agree to participate in the Mentor Program, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood the above terms.${prompt}
  13148: 'I am sorry, but you do not meet the requirements necessary to accept the Records of Eminence objective ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'

    No.${prompt}
  13154: You are now a registered mentor.${prompt}
  13155: |-
    You can enable "Mentor Status" by using the command ${color: 5}/mentor on${color: 1}.
    You can disable the status by using ${color: 5}/mentor off${color: 1}.${prompt}

  13158: '${color-alt: 138}A new objective, ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, has been added to Records of Eminence.'
  13159: You want to know about mannequins? Ha ha, there's a word I haven't heard in quite a long time. What would a young adventurer such as yourself want with such an outdated piece?${prompt}
  13160: |-
    Well, I'm not one to judge people on their tastes.
    Yes, there was a time when we here at the Carpenters' Guild manufactured nearly all of the mannequins in the Kingdom. They were our best sellers.${prompt}
  13161: Why, that catalog you have there--that was one of many published and printed by us.${prompt}
  13162: We had so many orders that we had to work twenty-five hours a day to keep up. That is, until the accident...${prompt}
  13163: Hmph. I can tell by the look on your face that you wish for me to continue. Very well...${prompt}
  13164: There was to be a grand fashion show held by the Weavers' Guild in Windurst, and they needed a large quantity of mannequins to display all their new clothes and armor.${prompt}
  13165: It was an enormous undertaking. However, honored to receive such a tremendous order from the Federation, the guildmaster at the time accepted the challenge without hesitation.${prompt}
  13166: And, as promised, the guild finished all of the beautifully constructed mannequins within the allotted time frame and sent them off to Windurst.${prompt}
  13167: However, as the shipment was being carried down the Phanauet Channel through Jugner Forest, the ferry was attacked by beastmen. The fiends must have thought the ship was a transport vessel for knights and supplies.${prompt}
  13168: The few adventurers that accompanied the ship were no match for the enemy, and the ship and her cargo were lost...${prompt}
  13169: Days later, our guild received a message from Windurst saying that they refused to pay for the stolen mannequins, going as far as citing our negligence in guarding the shipment as justification. Outraged by this blatant breach of contract, our guild continued to demand payment. This “feud” of sorts lasted for years.${prompt}
  13170: |-
    But that was not the only problem that arose from the accident...
    Weeks after the attack, the beastmen began throwing the arms, legs, and heads of their “prizes” over our town walls and into our streets. It was as if they were bragging of their victory.${prompt}
  13171: Seeing this filled the hearts of the townspeople with fear. Mannequins soon became a symbol of ill fate, and those that remained in shops and guilds were destroyed.${prompt}
  13172: As a craftsman, it pains me to know that idle superstition has taken such a precedence over fine work. And that is why, as a craftsman, I give my full support to anyone who wishes to recreate such a product. Unfortunately, our guild no longer has any of the materials needed for building a mannequin, nor do I know of one who possesses the skill to construct the pieces necessary.${prompt}
  13173: |-
    Ah, but I do have something that may be of use to you.
    The goldsmith that constructed the joints for our mannequins left these diagrams. They are of no use to me... Perhaps if a goldsmith were to view them, the plans might give some sort of clue as to their manufacture.${prompt}
  13174: 'I can also tell you that in addition to the joints, the following parts were needed to complete a mannequin: ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  13175: However, you won't find any of those items up on auction. Their sale has been prohibited ever since the accident. If there are any left, they'd be in the hands of the beastmen themselves.${prompt}
  13176: Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  13177: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.

    Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me!

    Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage!

    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...

    Incredible, kupo!
    You must have nerves of darksteel!
    Here, you've earned this, kupo!${prompt}

    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  13187: |-
    You haven't earned my really special present yet!
    Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!${prompt}
  13188: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  13189: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  13190: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  13191: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  13192: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  13193: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}

    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  13195: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  13196: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  13197: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  13198: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  13199: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  13200: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  13201: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13202: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  13203: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  13204: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  13205: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  13206: Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt}
  13207: |-
    Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?
    I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt}
  13208: |-
    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  13209: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  13210: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!
    Kupupupu...${prompt}
  13211: |-
    This place is crawling with nasties.
    You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt}
  13212: Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt}
  13213: |-
    I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.
    This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt}
  13214: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt}
  13215: If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt}
  13216: Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.${prompt}

  13265: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  13266: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  13267: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  13268: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  13269: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  13270: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  13271: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  13272: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  13273: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  13274: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  13275: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  13276: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  13277: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  13278: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  13279: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  13280: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  13281: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  13282: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  13283: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  13284: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  13285: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  13286: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  13287: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  13288: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  13289: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  13290: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  13291: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  13292: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  13305: I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to hear your sermon.${prompt}
  13306: However, there are still many things I do not understand. Would you be so kind as to spare a few moments to answer my questions?${prompt}
  13307: Of course, my child. What is it you wish to know?${prompt}
  13308: When I was young, I often heard the stories of Paradise.${prompt}
  13309: |-
    A legendary land where the gods slumber...
    A gate leading to that land, discovered by the ancients...${prompt}
  13310: However, according to the stories I heard, the ancients angered the Twilight God by attempting to open the forbidden gate. As punishment, he cast a terrible curse upon them all...${prompt}
  13311: If this hideous tale is true, then why is the San d'Orian Cathedral attempting to convince people that we should open the gates...?${prompt}
  13312: Or has the cathedral discovered a method to soothe the wrath of the gods?${prompt}
  13313: |-
    ...
    I must assume that you are not of our kingdom.${prompt}
  13314: That is correct. I was born in the Marquisate of Tavnazia, and baptized by the Tavnazian Cathedral.${prompt}
  13315: Our church, too, teaches of the Gates of the Gods--the Gates of Paradise. However, we are told it is a line that the children of Vana'diel have been forbidden to cross.${prompt}
  13316: The exact opposite of what the San d'Orian Cathedral teaches...${prompt}
  13317: For the past twenty years, we have searched tirelessly for an entrance to Paradise.${prompt}
  13318: And it is during that search we realized that the only path to soothing the Twilight God's wrath is to eschew all desire and embrace Altana.${prompt}
  13319: That is all...?${prompt}
  13320: |-
    I apologize, but I must prepare for my next sermon.
    If you wish to learn more, inquire with one of the high priests.${prompt}
  13321: C'est le travail de toute une vie de nos missionnaires d'apporter l'illumination. Puissent-ils vous guider dans la direction de la vérité...${prompt}
  13322: Avant la Grande Guerre, lorsque l'ancien papsque, Muchavatte P Couchiret, était encore parmi nous...${prompt}
  13323: À son époque, nous croyions que les Portes du Paradis étaient cachées quelque part à portée de l'homme mortel.${prompt}
  13324: Le chevalier royal que vous recherchez, Francmage M Mistalle, a rejoint l'expédition multinationale il y a trente ans pour rechercher la vérité derrière cette croyance. Et c'est à cause de cette même recherche...${prompt}
  13325: Bienvenue, voyageurs. Même après avoir écouté le sermon du vicasque, vous avez encore des questions concernant le Paradis ?${prompt}
  13326: Très bien. S'il vous plaît, suivez-moi et je vais essayer de combler votre soif de connaissance.${prompt}
  13327: C'est le Reliquaire de la cathédrale. Il a été construit en souvenir de l'un de nos anciens papsques, Muchavatte P Couchiret.${prompt}
  13328: Pendant son pontificat, le papsque s'est consacré à guérir les blessures dans les cœurs des hommes - des blessures laissées par les flammes de la guerre.${prompt}
  13329: La Déesse de l'Aube veillait sur lui et sur son travail, et le bénissait de sa gloire.${prompt}
  13330: Cependant, ce n'est pas tout ce qu'elle lui a donné. Avant sa mort, Altana a montré au papsque le chemin du Paradis.${prompt}
  13331: Le chemin du Paradis... ?${prompt}
  13332: Oui. Ses dernières paroles nous ont dit que pour obtenir le Paradis, il faut renoncer à tout désir et embrasser la Déesse de l'Aube.${prompt}
  13333: Pendant de nombreuses années, nous avons cru que le chemin du Paradis et les portes le gardant étaient des choses qui existaient réellement sur Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13334: La cathédrale a fouillé dans les anciens tomes et documents de nos voûtes, est allée en guerre contre d'autres nations...${prompt}
  13335: J'ai entendu dire que San d'Oria a même attaqué la cathédrale de Tavnazia... Tout cela pour trouver un Paradis qui n'était destiné qu'à exister dans nos cœurs...${prompt}
  13336: Instiller la peur pour trouver une terre où l'humanité pourrait vivre sans peur. Ce paradoxe a finalement mis de la distance entre nous et Altana.${prompt}
  13337: Mais grâce aux enseignements de Muchavatte, nous avons réalisé l'erreur de nos chemins et avons ainsi fait de notre mission d'illuminer nos frères et sœurs concernant le véritable chemin vers le Paradis.${prompt}
  13338: Comprenez-vous ?${prompt}
  13339: Oui, je crois comprendre.${prompt}
  13340: Cependant, j'ai une dernière question. Comment pouvons-nous nous libérer de la malédiction du Dieu Crépusculaire ?${prompt}
  13341: C'est...${prompt}
  13342: Il est interdit de parler du détestable.${prompt}
  13343: De toutes choses, vous devriez bien le savoir, enfant de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13344: '...${prompt}'
  13345: Voyageurs, ne vous inquiétez pas.${prompt}
  13346: Il est de notre devoir de servir Altana et d'introduire sa lumière bénie aux masses malheureuses.${prompt}
  13347: Si nous suivons les enseignements de la Déesse de l'Aube et ne nous écartons pas du chemin de la droiture, les chaînes du mal seront brisées et les Portes du Paradis s'ouvriront.${prompt}
  13348: |-
    Yes... I see now...
    Thank you very much for your kindness in explaining this all to us.${prompt}
  13349: No, you need not thank me. I am simply pleased to know that you now understand the truth behind Paradise.${prompt}
  13350: Wait...${prompt}
  13351: You said that you seek the Royal Knight Francmage M Mistalle, did you not?${prompt}
  13352: If I am not mistaken, I recall a section of Jugner Forest known as Carpenters' Landing being owned by the Knights Mistalle.${prompt}
  13353: I do not believe you will be able to reach the manor, but you may find some of his hands by the water collecting firewood.${prompt}
  13354: Ah, the adventurer I conversed with in the reliquary...${prompt}
  13355: You say you are searching for one Sir Louverance, an envoy of the cathedral?${prompt}
  13356: He would be the grandson of Francmage M Mistalle, the Royal Knight you were investigating earlier.${prompt}
  13357: That Sir Louverance had retired from the Royal Knights is common knowledge; however, I have heard nothing of his enlistment in the order of Temple Knights.${prompt}
  13358: If we high priests were not informed of his return to military service, he must be entrusted with a mission of the highest importance indeed.${prompt}
  13359: It would seem to me that if Sir Louverance is traveling by airship, then the wisest place to search for him would be the port. Do you not agree?${prompt}
  13360: I was not aware that Sir Louverance was acting as an envoy for the cathedral.${prompt}
  13361: However, if he is traveling by airship, perhaps you should await his return to San d'Oria at the port.${prompt}
  13362: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    My curiosity was sufficiently piqued to do some investigating of my own into the Knights Mistalle...${prompt}
  13363: |-
    It is lovely to see you again, High Priest Chasalvige.
    I am afraid I neglected to properly introduce myself at our first meeting.${prompt}
  13364: |-
    My name is Ulmia.
    I was advised to seek your counsel by Lady Hinaree.${prompt}
  13365: Now I understand.${prompt}
  13366: The reason for your keen interest in the nature of Paradise and the curse of the Twilight God is clear to me.${prompt}
  13367: |-
    Lady Ulmia.
    And you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13368: |-
    You need not fear being overheard in this place.
    Let us be entirely truthful with one another and speak openly of these matters.${prompt}
  13369: '...Matters concerning the Tavnazian choir''s efforts to complete the five verses.${prompt}'
  13370: You know of the song...?${prompt}
  13371: Before the advent of the Great War, you came to visit Lady Hinaree with Cardinal Mildaurion and her companion, did you not?${prompt}
  13372: I was permitted to accompany Papsque Muchavatte, and was present at the proceedings.${prompt}
  13373: I am certain that at that time, you had little idea of the reason behind that gathering.${prompt}
  13374: It was, in fact, a meeting to improve the failing relations between the cathedrals of San d'Oria and Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13375: "In particular, there seemed to be no end to the unsavory rumors surrounding the Tavnazian Cathedral. \nThis was perhaps due to the strict policy of secrecy the Tavnazians had adopted following the period of internecine conflict in San d'Oria.${prompt}"
  13376: The papsque sent a messenger to determine the accuracy of these rumors.${prompt}
  13377: However, Cardinal Mildaurion arrived accompanied by two young girls.${prompt}
  13378: And one of those girls--you, Ulmia--sang a certain song...${prompt}
  13379: |-
    Yes, I remember.
    But my voice was still untrained and Papsque Muchavatte grew furious at my terrible singing.${prompt}
  13380: |-
    No, child, that is not why he was angry.
    The reason behind the papsque's outburst was his fear that the song you were singing would be completed...${prompt}
  13381: He was frantic to stem the dreadful power of that song.${prompt}
  13382: Dreadful power?${prompt}
  13383: It is perhaps for the best that you remained ignorant of the truth.${prompt}
  13384: |-
    This story finds its beginning almost five hundred years ago...
    It reaches back to an era considered to be a time of humiliation for the Elvaan.${prompt}
  13385: At that time, the Quon continent was under the control of an army dispatched by the Federation of Windurst.${prompt}
  13386: The Elvaan race had yet to form a nation of their own, and the numerous tribes lived in forests apart from one another.${prompt}
  13387: |-
    But even as now, the blood of the Elvaan ran deep with pride.
    Swearing victory upon his sword, the hero Lanfeaur d'Oraguille came forth to lead our people to freedom.${prompt}
  13388: Along with General Alphollon Tajeux, who was later to become the Marquis of Tavnazia, they founded a kingdom on the strength of two valuable artifacts.${prompt}
  13389: However, after the battle to emancipate the Elvaan, both of these treasures were lost.${prompt}
  13390: In their respective places in the cathedrals of San d'Oria and Tavnazia, two mysterious stone tablets were left behind.${prompt}
  13391: We toiled long and hard to solve the riddles of the tablets, and were finally able to retrieve one of the objects in the age of King Ranperre--the holy sword, Lightbringer.${prompt}
  13392: In spite of this success, the Tavnazian Cathedral refused to reveal the contents of the second tablet.${prompt}
  13393: A secret investigation instigated by the San d'Orian Cathedral discovered the writings upon the stone were actually the verses of a song.${prompt}
  13394: |-
    Yes, you know this song only too well...

    The Tavnazian Cathedral had deciphered the words, but the melody yet eluded them.

    Eh? That hag Reinberta told you I could help?
    Here, let me see that scroll...${prompt}
  13510: Hmph. All this fancy jade... Reinberta would like something as useless as this. A good old iron clasp, now that's all you need. Sturdy, inexpensive, and practical, let me tell you...${prompt}
  13511: Ahem... Now, what does this Albanus character have to say...?${prompt}
  13512: |-
    Hm...
    Hrm...
    So that is what he means...${prompt}
  13513: It seems that the alloy our bellmaker is speaking of in his diary and on this scroll is Minstrel Metal.${prompt}
  13514: What? You've never heard of it? Well, of course you haven't. The method for making it has been lost for decades.${prompt}
  13515: Minstrel Metal receives its name from the enchanting sound that it emits when struck.${prompt}
  13516: The tones are so beautiful, that it was said people would come from around the Kingdom just to hear the ballads created during the alloy's forging.${prompt}
  13517: I believe that this scroll illustrates the lost method of smelting Minstrel Metal...but it is all written in some strange code. I can only guess the author did not want anyone to steal his techniques.${prompt}
  13518: But if that author really was Albanus, then the cryptic message would make some sense.${prompt}
  13519: You see, I have heard tales of the eccentric young bellmaker...${prompt}
  13520: Once, long ago, there was a novice goldsmith named Albanus who spent day and night studying the art of bellmaking. He was quite a prodigy, people said.${prompt}
  13521: Most of the time, the young man would lock himself up in his room behind the guild and pound away at his Minstrel Metal, until one day a strange boy called upon Albanus.${prompt}
  13522: The boy said he had been drawn to the “voices of the angels,” and asked if he could stay with Albanus.${prompt}
  13523: At first the bellmaker was puzzled, but soon grew fond of the boy and his appreciation of Albanus's work. And though he himself was still an amateur, he allowed the boy to become his pupil, and proceeded to teach him the ways of smithing.${prompt}
  13524: However, it turned out that the pupil did more teaching than the master. The boy began telling Albanus how he was to create his bells, and it was not long before the boy's influence was heard in the song that rang forth from the novice goldsmith's workshop.${prompt}
  13525: But then one day, the sound stopped. Just as suddenly as the strange boy had appeared, he had vanished, and along with him, young Albanus...${prompt}
  13526: Some say that the zealous bellmaker simply left on a journey to discover new materials and techniques...${prompt}
  13527: '...While others say it was the boy that forced Albanus to leave...${prompt}'
  13528: They say that he had found a way inside Albanus's mind and made him go mad...${prompt}
  13529: |-
    But if you ask me, I don't think it was either.
    You see, the job of an artist is to move the hearts of the masses.${prompt}
  13530: However, when an artist becomes too attached to his own work, strange things can begin to occur.${prompt}
  13531: Eh? You still don't understand what I'm trying to say?${prompt}
  13532: Haven't you been listening at all!?${prompt}
  13533: When an artist spends his whole life working on something, a part of his soul is sometimes transferred to the piece.${prompt}
  13534: I cannot fully explain the existence of these newborn “spirits,” but there are many who believe in them.${prompt}
  13535: However, one thing I can be certain of is this--if the boy who led poor Albanus away was truly born from a raw form of the bellmaker's passion, then he may be quite dangerous...${prompt}
  13536: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  13537: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}

    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!

  13736: Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.${prompt}
  13737: |-
    I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is.
    Do you have any particular style you want me to use?${prompt}
  13738: |-
    No matter the job, I can fight in any style!
    Is there a particular style you recommend?${prompt}
  13739: |-
    Jobs?
    If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me.
    What kind of combat style do you recommend?${prompt}
  13740: I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?${prompt}
  13741: |-
    There are so many jobs to choose from.
    Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt}
  13742: You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?${prompt}
  13743: |-
    Hmm.
    I'll give it a shot.${prompt}
  13744: |-
    Right!
    That's the style for me!${prompt}
  13745: |-
    Hmm.
    I'll try it.${prompt}
  13746: |-
    Okay.
    I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  13747: |-
    Okay then.
    I'll start doing that from next time.${prompt}
  13748: Sounds good! Leave it to me!${prompt}
  13749: Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.${prompt}
  13750: |-
    Okay!
    Sounds like fun!${prompt}
  13751: |-
    Really?
    Okay, I'll try it out.${prompt}
  13752: |-
    Hmmm. Okay!
    I'll do my best!${prompt}
  13753: |-
    Okay.
    I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  13754: |-
    Fine.
    I will try your suggested combat style.${prompt}
  13755: |-
    What?
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13756: |-
    My headwear?
    You think it's time for a change?${prompt}
  13757: You don't like my headwear?${prompt}
  13758: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13759: You want to choose new headwear for me?${prompt}
  13760: |-
    You're interested in my headwear?
    Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.${prompt}
  13761: |-
    What? Come on, out with it.
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13762: |-
    Huh!?
    You don't like my headwear?
    Should I wear something else?${prompt}
  13763: |-
    Yes?
    You want me to change my headwear?${prompt}
  13764: |-
    What are you staring at?
    Don't you like my headwear?${prompt}
  13765: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13766: My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.${prompt}
  13767: Well, I guess I could wear something else.${prompt}
  13768: Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.${prompt}
  13769: I'll change it, then.${prompt}
  13770: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13771: Thanks. I'll try this one.${prompt}
  13772: Ooh, I like your style!${prompt}
  13773: Okay, I'll change it for you.${prompt}
  13774: |-
    Well, okay.
    A change is as good as a holiday!${prompt}
  13775: I'll try something new, then.${prompt}
  13776: Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!${prompt}
  13777: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13778: Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.${prompt}
  13779: I'll forget you said anything, then.${prompt}
  13780: |-
    Oh?
    Okay.${prompt}
  13781: Well, that's a relief.${prompt}
  13782: I'll stay the way I am, then.${prompt}
  13783: |-
    So I don't need to change it?
    Fashion can be so frustrating...${prompt}
  13784: You like me just the way I am, eh?${prompt}
  13785: Well, that's good to hear.${prompt}
  13786: |-
    Are you sure?
    Well, I guess that's a good thing...${prompt}
  13787: |-
    Oh?
    Alright, then.${prompt}
  13788: |-
    Phew!
    I thought you thought I looked funny or something!${prompt}

  13801: |-
    You lost it?

  13802: You lost it? Hmph. Here, take this. But there'll be hell to pay if you misplace that one, too.${prompt}
  13803: |-
    I just gave you one!
    I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.${prompt}

    You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.${prompt}
  13815: |-
    With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.
    I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt}
  13816: |-
    Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?
    I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!${prompt}
  13817: |-
    Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?
    Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt}
  13818: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13819: |-
    Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?
    An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...${prompt}
  13820: |-
    Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?
    And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt}
  13821: |-
    Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.
    You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt}
  13822: Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...${prompt}
  13823: |-
    Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.
    Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt}
  13824: |-
    I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats?
    Do archdukes eat curry...?${prompt}

    My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno.
    Most likely the part that would form the main body...${prompt}
  13827: |-
    Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.
    A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.${prompt}
  13828: |-
    Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!
    Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  13829: |-
    If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.
    I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt}
  13830: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13831: |-
    Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.
    At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.${prompt}
  13832: |-
    A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out.
    I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt}
  13833: |-
    The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.
    No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt}
  13834: |-
    How embarrassing...
    I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt}
  13835: |-
    Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.
    Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt}
  13836: |-
    Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?
    What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt}
  13837: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13838: |-
    That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--
    A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt}
  13839: Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt}
  13840: |-
    Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?
    No...?${prompt}
  13841: |-
    I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.
    Bastok is a weird place...${prompt}
  13842: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13843: |-
    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?
    I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt}
  13844: I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt}
  13845: I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt}
  13846: I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt}
  13847: |-
    I've never eaten a treant bulb before.
    What do they taste like?${prompt}
  13848: |-
    Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?
    What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt}
  13849: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13850: The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt}
  13851: |-
    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}
  13852: |-
    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13853: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13854: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13855: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13856: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13857: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13858: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  13859: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  13860: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  13861: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13862: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  13863: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  13864: |-
    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13865: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13866: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13867: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13868: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  13869: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  13870: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  13871: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  13872: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  13873: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13874: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13875: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13876: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  13877: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  13878: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13879: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  13880: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  13881: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  13882: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13883: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  13884: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13885: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13886: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13887: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13888: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13889: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13890: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13891: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  13892: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13893: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  13894: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13895: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  13896: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13897: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13898: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13899: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13900: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13901: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13902: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13903: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  13904: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  13905: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  13906: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  13907: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  13908: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13909: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13910: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13911: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13912: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13913: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  13914: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13915: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  13916: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  13917: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  13918: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  13919: I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt}
  13920: |-
    What do you keep in your Mog House?
    Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt}
  13921: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13922: I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt}
  13923: |-
    I have a friend in the business, you see.
    I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt}
  13924: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  13925: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  13926: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  13927: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  13928: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  13929: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  13930: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  13931: |-
    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}
  13932: |-
    It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?
    Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt}
  13933: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  13934: What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...${prompt}

    Headwear.
    Fashionable equipment.${prompt}

    Your current headwear is fine.

    Ça va pour l'instant, kupo.${prompt}
  14345: To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt}
  14346: So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt}
  14347: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  14348: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}
  14349: The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt}
  14350: What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt}
  14351: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  14352: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  14353: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  14354: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  14355: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  14356: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  14357: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}
  14358: You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt}
  14359: Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt}

  14369: Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt}
  14370: It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt}

    Leave town?

  14374: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  14375: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  14376: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}
  14377: Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt}

  14383: Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt}
  14384: Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  14385: Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  14386: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.'

    Ghosts!?
    Yes, I've heard.${prompt}
  14392: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  14393: Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt}
  14394: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Allow me to explain.
    I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  14395: I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt}
  14396: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  14397: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  14398: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  14399: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  14400: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  14401: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  14402: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}
  14403: Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt}
  14404: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  14405: |-
    Ahaha...
    How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14406: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  14407: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  14408: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  14409: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  14410: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  14411: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  14412: Good luck.${prompt}
  14413: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?
    What of the spirit...?${prompt}
  14414: |-
    I see...
    So that is her purpose...${prompt}
  14415: The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt}
  14416: I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt}
  14417: |-
    You have been a great help.
    Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  14418: |-
    This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.
    Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
    Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt}
  14419: However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt}
  14420: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  14421: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  14422: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14423: Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt}
  14424: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt}
  14425: Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt}
  14426: |-
    The second spirit is called Guwanana.
    She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt}
  14427: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt}
  14428: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  14429: |-
    I'll get straight to the point.
    Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt}
  14430: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  14431: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  14432: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  14433: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  14434: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  14435: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  14436: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  14437: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  14438: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  14439: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  14440: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  14441: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14442: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  14443: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  14444: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  14445: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  14446: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  14447: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  14448: Good luck!${prompt}
  14449: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  14450: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  14451: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  14452: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  14453: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  14454: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  14455: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  14456: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  14457: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14458: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  14459: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  14460: What do you think?${prompt}
  14461: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  14462: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  14463: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  14464: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  14465: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  14466: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  14467: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  14468: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  14469: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  14470: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  14471: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  14472: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  14473: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  14474: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  14475: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  14476: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14477: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  14478: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  14479: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  14480: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  14481: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  14482: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  14483: Good luck!${prompt}
  14484: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  14485: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  14486: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  14487: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  14488: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  14489: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  14490: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  14491: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  14492: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  14493: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  14494: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  14495: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  14496: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.
    Please be careful...${prompt}
  14497: |-
    You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.
    Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt}
  14498: |-
    I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.
    Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt}
  14499: I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt}
  14500: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  14501: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  14502: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  14503: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  14504: So pretty...the fountain is still so...${prompt}
  14505: |-
    That must be...the chateau...
    And over there...the cathedral...${prompt}
  14506: I never thought...to return here...${prompt}
  14507: |-
    Every morning...I watched him training...from afar...
    If only...I had had the courage...${prompt}
  14508: |-
    No...he was a Hume...
    I...am a witch...
    If I were...to confess...${prompt}
  14509: |-
    And then...there was the lunch...he always carried...
    Someone...must have made it...for him...${prompt}
  14510: |-
    He passed...without ever knowing...
    But I...am still here...${prompt}
  14511: |-
    I...
    I should no longer care...
    I want to forget...${prompt}
  14512: |-
    The fountain where he took his rest...
    The stones that grew wet with his tears...
    Nothing has changed...except me...${prompt}
  14513: |-
    The moat where he swam...
    The shade where he slept...
    It is still the same...${prompt}
  14514: |-
    Ah...I know you are there...
    But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...${prompt}
  14515: This moat...where I fell in...${prompt}
  14516: |-
    I slipped...on the bridge...
    I fell...${prompt}
  14517: |-
    He was always there...
    I didn't notice...${prompt}
  14518: |-
    From the time that I was small...
    Always there to save me...${prompt}
  14519: |-
    Even when I was loathed and feared...
    You were there to praise my power...${prompt}
  14520: My brother...${prompt}
  14521: |-
    But I...I was always angry...
    I even forgot the lunch you made...${prompt}
  14522: |-
    But here...
    I want to tell you just once...${prompt}
  14523: |-
    Thank you...
    Thank you for being there...for me...${prompt}
  14524: Your lunches...always made with so much care...${prompt}
  14525: |-
    I see you there...
    Listening to me... I should curse you...
    But I will forgive you...as my brother would...${prompt}
  14526: |-
    These trees...
    I burned with the Fire spell...
    Yet they have grown back...${prompt}
  14527: |-
    This stream...
    I froze with Blizzaga II...
    Yet now it flows...${prompt}
  14528: |-
    This building...
    I toppled with Aeroga III...
    Yet it has been rebuilt...${prompt}
  14529: |-
    The wall of the Metalworks...
    I cracked with Thunder IV...
    Yet it has been repaired...${prompt}
  14530: |-
    It is as if...I never existed...
    Have my sins...also been erased...?${prompt}
  14531: |-
    My magic...has always been overpowerful...
    The cold stares...of the townspeople...${prompt}
  14532: |-
    I learned my spells...for vengeance...
    People called me...heartless...${prompt}
  14533: I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...${prompt}
  14534: |-
    Then why...?
    Why do I feel so at home here...?${prompt}
  14535: |-
    Why...?
    Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?${prompt}
  14536: |-
    You...I see you...
    Cease your stalking...
    I wish to be alone...${prompt}
  14537: A genius...is never understood...by the masses...${prompt}
  14538: A genius...is isolated...from the common people...${prompt}
  14539: A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...${prompt}
  14540: |-
    I wanted to save her...
    The girl with astounding talent...${prompt}
  14541: To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...${prompt}
  14542: |-
    The Dark Lilies...
    A coven of...chosen...
    A sanctuary...for witches...${prompt}
  14543: |-
    Yet...I wonder...
    Was it all...for the best...?
    To leave...this world behind...?${prompt}
  14544: |-
    Was she...truly happy...?
    Being enveloped...in the darkness...?${prompt}
  14545: |-
    I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time...
    In this town...the town I had forsaken...${prompt}
  14546: |-
    I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found...
    In this town...that I once loved...${prompt}
  14547: |-
    You...go back...
    Back to the exorcist...
    Tell him...I am ready...to leave...${prompt}
  14548: This...was a secret place...${prompt}
  14549: A place...that nobody knew...${prompt}
  14550: The perrrfect spot...${prompt}
  14551: |-
    An enchanted spot...
    So many fish...
    They would just jump...onto the hook...${prompt}
  14552: To fill...my empty belly...${prompt}
  14553: To help...my strrruggling mother...${prompt}
  14554: |-
    I would fish...and fish...and fish...
    We were poor...I had no other choice...${prompt}
  14555: |-
    Even so...those days were fun...
    But I hated...being poor...
    I delved...into forbidden magic...${prompt}
  14556: |-
    I'm sorry...Mother...
    The day...I left home...
    I wanted...wanted to tell you...${prompt}
  14557: |-
    I'm sorry...
    I brrroke my prrromise...to lead an honest life...
    I wanted...wanted to tell you...${prompt}

    Glimmer...shimmer...
    Shimmer...glimmer...${prompt}

    Little fishies...
    Shimmering fishy-wishies...

    Little fishies...
    Glimmering fishy-wishies...
    Are you here...?${prompt}
  14562: |-
    You mustaru be here...
    You mustaru be hiding...${prompt}
  14563: |-
    Here and there...
    The fishy-wishies I let free...
    Shimmering...glimmering...fish...${prompt}

    But...I don'taru see you...?
    Where have you gone...?${prompt}

    The same as before...

    Shimmer...glimmer...
    So many little fishy-wishies...
    You swim...and glide...${prompt}
  14569: |-
    Are you satisfied...?
    Then hushy-wush and leave...
    You'll scare the fishy-wishies...${prompt}
  14570: You hear a voice speaking softly...${prompt}
  14571: |-
    Trick or treat?
    I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!${prompt}
  14572: |-
    What a wonderful witch hat, kupo!
    Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!${prompt}
  14573: 'Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple ${color: 5}cheers${color: 1}!${prompt}'
  14574: 'We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is ${color: 5}cheer${color: 1} us along!${prompt}'
  14575: |-
    Bad tree! Bad tree!
    We won't let him get any further, kupo! Just keep ${color: 5}cheering${color: 1} us on!${prompt}
  14576: |-
    Thanks, everybody!
    Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!${prompt}
  14577: |-
    10000... 15000... 30000!
    The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!${prompt}
  14578: |-
    Unnnnnngh... Bad tree!
    We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!${prompt}
  14579: Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!${prompt}
  14580: The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...${prompt}
  14581: Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.${prompt}
  14582: However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...${prompt}
  14583: I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the “other” smilebringers...${prompt}
  14584: I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...${prompt}
  14585: I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?${prompt}
  14586: You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?${prompt}
  14587: You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt}
  14588: I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.${prompt}
  14589: You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  14590: Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...${prompt}
  14591: Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.${prompt}
  14592: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.${prompt}
  14593: There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.${prompt}
  14594: I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?${prompt}
  14595: I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.${prompt}
  14596: |-
    Who the kewpo are you, kewpo?
    I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!${prompt}
  14597: |-
    Ummm...
    I can explaining, kewpo...${prompt}
  14598: |-
    Just not today!
    Kew-pooooooooo!${prompt}
  14599: Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?${prompt}
  14600: |-
    Uh-huh...
    So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt}
  14601: One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.${prompt}
  14602: I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!${prompt}
  14603: |-
    What?
    You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?${prompt}
  14604: Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.${prompt}
  14605: Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.${prompt}
  14606: Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory${prompt}
  14607: Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.${prompt}
  14608: Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?${prompt}
  14609: I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.${prompt}
  14610: Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?${prompt}
  14611: Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.${prompt}
  14612: One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.${prompt}
  14613: |-
    But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe.
    Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!${prompt}
  14614: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}
  14615: As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  14616: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  14617: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  14618: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  14619: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  14620: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  14621: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment''s regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt}'
  14622: 'Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt}'
  14623: 'Alright. Here''s your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you''re ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}'
  14624: Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt}
  14625: 'Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  14626: Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt}
  14627: We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt}
  14628: |-
    Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
    It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}
  14629: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'

  14673: Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...${prompt}
  14674: The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.${prompt}
  14675: Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.${prompt}
  14676: In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?${prompt}
  14677: Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some “bravery” and “drive” onto your resume. Go figure!${prompt}
  14678: The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.${prompt}
  14679: And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.${prompt}
  14680: In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.${prompt}
  14681: Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  14682: The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.${prompt}
  14683: Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.${prompt}
  14684: In other words, you're a smart ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?${prompt}
  14685: Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!${prompt}
  14686: The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.${prompt}
  14687: Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.${prompt}
  14688: In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.${prompt}
  14689: Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.${prompt}
  14690: The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.${prompt}
  14691: Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.${prompt}
  14692: In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.${prompt}
  14693: Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!${prompt}
  14694: The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.${prompt}
  14695: Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.${prompt}
  14696: In other words, that “pristine balance” helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.${prompt}
  14697: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!${prompt}
  14698: The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.${prompt}
  14699: And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.${prompt}
  14700: In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!${prompt}
  14701: Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!${prompt}
  14702: The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.${prompt}
  14703: Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.${prompt}
  14704: In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.${prompt}
  14705: Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!${prompt}
  14706: The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.${prompt}
  14707: Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.${prompt}
  14708: In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.${prompt}
  14709: Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!${prompt}
  14710: The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.${prompt}
  14711: Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.${prompt}
  14712: In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!${prompt}
  14713: Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.${prompt}
  14714: The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.${prompt}
  14715: Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.${prompt}
  14716: In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!${prompt}
  14717: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!${prompt}
  14718: |-
    Uh-huh...
    Uh-huh...
    Yeah, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.${prompt}
  14719: |-
    You want me to tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that, too? Alright.
    Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...${prompt}

  14721: |-
    I knew it. You adventurers are all alike.
    Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.${prompt}
  14722: You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.${prompt}
  14723: He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.${prompt}
  14724: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...${prompt}
  14725: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some big white contraption...${prompt}

  14957: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  14958: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  14959: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  14960: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  14961: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}

  14963: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  14964: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}

  14980: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  14981: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  14982: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14983: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  14984: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14985: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  14986: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  14987: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14988: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  14989: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  14990: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14991: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  14992: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  14993: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  14994: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  14995: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  14996: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  14997: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  14998: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}

  15003: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  15004: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  15005: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  15006: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  15007: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  15008: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  15009: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  15010: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  15011: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  15012: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  15013: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  15014: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  15015: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  15016: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    What would you like to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Why feeding is important.
    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  15018: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  15019: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  15020: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  15021: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  15022: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  15023: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  15024: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  15025: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  15026: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  15027: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  15028: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  15029: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  15030: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  15031: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  15032: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  15033: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  15034: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  15035: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  15036: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  15037: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  15038: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  15039: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  15040: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  15041: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  15042: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  15043: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}
  15044: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  15046: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  15047: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  15048: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  15049: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  15050: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  15051: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  15052: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  15053: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  15054: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  15055: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  15056: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  15057: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  15058: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  15059: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  15060: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  15061: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15062: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  15063: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15064: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  15065: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  15066: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  15067: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  15073: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'

    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}

  16207: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'

  16209: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  16210: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  16211: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  16212: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  16213: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  16214: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  16215: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  16216: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  16217: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  16218: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  16219: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  16220: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  16221: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  16222: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  16223: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  16224: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  16225: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  16226: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  16227: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  16228: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  16229: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  16230: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'

  16493: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  16494: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  16495: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}

  16497: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  16498: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}

  16502: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  16503: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  16509: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  16510: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  16511: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  16512: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  16513: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  16514: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  16515: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  16516: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  16517: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  16518: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  16519: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  16520: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  16521: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  16522: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  16523: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  16524: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  16525: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  16526: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  16527: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  16528: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  16529: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  16530: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  16531: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  16532: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  16533: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  16534: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  16535: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  16536: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  16537: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Collecting winnings.
    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  16539: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  16540: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  16541: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  16542: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  16543: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  16544: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  16545: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  16546: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  16547: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  16548: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  16549: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  16550: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  16551: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  16552: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  16553: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  16554: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  16555: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  16556: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  16557: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  16559: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  16560: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  16561: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  16562: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  16563: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  16564: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  16565: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  16566: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  16567: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  16568: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  16569: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  16570: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  16571: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  16572: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  16573: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  16574: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  16575: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  16576: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  16577: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  16578: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  16579: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  16580: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  16581: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

    Which would you like to hear about?
    ${selection-lines}
    CRA rationale behind veteran races.
    How do I register for a race?
    How do I prepare for a race?
    What are ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}?
    What kinds of races are there?
    What are “racing teams”?
    What about race opponents?
    Quit.
    Return.${prompt}
  16644: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  16645: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  16646: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  16647: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  16648: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  16649: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  16650: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  16651: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  16652: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  16653: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  16654: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  16655: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  16656: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  16657: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  16658: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  16659: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  16660: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  16661: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  16662: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  16663: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  16664: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  16665: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  16666: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  16667: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  16668: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  16669: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  16670: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  16671: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  16672: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  16673: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  16674: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  16675: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  16676: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  16677: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  16678: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  16679: |-

  16750: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  16751: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  16752: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  16753: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  16754: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  16755: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}

  16787: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  16788: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  16789: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  16790: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  16791: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  16792: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}

  16795: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  16796: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  16797: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  16798: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  16799: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  16800: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  16801: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  16802: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  16803: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  16804: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  16805: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  16806: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  16807: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  16808: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  16809: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  16810: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  16811: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  16812: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  16813: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  16814: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  16815: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  16816: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  16817: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  16818: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  16819: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  16820: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  16821: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  16822: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  16823: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  16824: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  16825: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  16826: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  16827: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  16828: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  16829: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  16830: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  16831: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  16832: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  16833: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  16834: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  16835: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  16836: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  16837: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  16838: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  16839: And they're off!
  16840: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  16841: Well, I fel--
  16842: ピヨピヨッ！
  16843: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  16844: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  16845: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  16846: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  16847: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  16848: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  16849: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  16850: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  16851: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  16852: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  16853: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  16854: ピヨピヨ！
  16855: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  16856: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  16857: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  16858: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  16859: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  16860: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  16861: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  16862: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  16863: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  16864: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  16865: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  16866: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  16867: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  16868: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  16869: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  16870: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  16871: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  16872: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  16873: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  16874: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  16875: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  16876: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  16877: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  16878: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  16879: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  16880: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  16881: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  16882: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  16883: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  16884: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  16885: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  16886: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  16887: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  16888: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  16889: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  16890: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  16891: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  16892: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  16893: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  16894: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  16895: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  16896: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  16897: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  16898: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  16899: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  16900: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  16901: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  16902: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  16903: Until next time, race fans...
  16904: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  16905: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  16906: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  16907: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  16908: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  16909: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  16910: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  16911: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  16912: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  16927: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  16928: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  16929: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  16930: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  16931: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  16932: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  16933: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  16934: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  16935: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  16936: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  16937: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  16938: But...?${prompt}
  16939: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  16940: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  16941: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  16942: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  16943: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  16944: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  16945: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  16946: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  16947: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  16948: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  16949: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  16950: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  16951: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  16952: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  16953: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  16954: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  16955: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  16956: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  16957: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  16958: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  16959: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  16960: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  16961: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  16962: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  16963: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  16964: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  16965: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  16966: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  16967: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  16968: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  16969: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  16970: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  16971: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  16972: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  16973: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  16974: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  16975: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  16976: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  16977: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  16978: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  16979: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  16980: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  16981: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  16982: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  16983: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  16984: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  16985: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  16986: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  16987: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  16988: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  16989: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  16990: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  16991: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  16992: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  16993: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  16994: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  16995: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  16996: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  16997: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  16998: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  16999: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  17000: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  17001: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  17002: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  17003: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  17004: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  17005: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  17006: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  17007: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  17008: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  17009: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  17010: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  17011: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  17012: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  17013: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  17014: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  17015: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  17016: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17017: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  17018: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  17019: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  17020: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  17021: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  17022: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17023: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  17024: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  17025: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  17026: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  17027: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  17028: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  17029: '...${prompt}'
  17030: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  17031: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  17032: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  17033: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  17034: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  17035: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  17036: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  17037: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  17038: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  17039: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  17040: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  17041: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  17042: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  17043: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  17044: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  17045: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  17046: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  17047: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  17048: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  17049: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  17050: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  17051: '...${prompt}'
  17052: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  17053: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  17054: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  17055: What's more...${prompt}
  17056: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  17057: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  17058: What...?${prompt}
  17059: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  17060: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  17061: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  17062: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  17063: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  17064: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  17065: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  17066: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  17067: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  17068: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  17069: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  17070: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  17071: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  17072: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  17073: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  17074: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  17075: And they're off!
  17076: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  17077: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  17078: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  17079: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  17080: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  17081: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  17082: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  17083: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  17084: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  17085: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  17086: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  17087: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  17088: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  17089: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  17090: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  17091: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  17092: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  17093: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  17094: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  17095: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  17096: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  17097: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  17098: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  17099: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  17100: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  17101: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  17102: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  17103: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  17104: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  17105: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  17106: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  17107: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  17108: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  17109: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  17110: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  17111: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  17112: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  17113: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  17114: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  17115: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  17116: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  17117: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  17118: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  17119: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  17120: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  17121: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  17122: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  17123: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  17124: |-
    You see a single, ivory ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} die on the table.
    There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 1} other players wishing to participate.${prompt}

    Read which chapter?
    ${selection-lines}
    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  17145: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  17146: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  17147: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  17148: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  17149: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  17150: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  17151: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'

    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  17164: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  17165: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  17166: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  17167: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}

    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}

    Your partner isn't ready to go.

    Your partner must talk to me as well.

    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  17172: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  17173: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  17174: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  17175: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  17176: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}

    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}

    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}

    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!

    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?${prompt}
  17184: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Part-time ghosts!?${prompt}
  17185: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  17186: We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.${prompt}
  17187: All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.${prompt}
  17188: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Then allow me to explain.${prompt}
  17189: A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  17190: During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.${prompt}
  17191: However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.${prompt}
  17192: Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt}
  17193: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  17194: |-
    Ah... How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17195: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  17196: The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.${prompt}
  17197: Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.${prompt}
  17198: Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  17199: You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  17200: Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.${prompt}
  17201: Please take this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt}
  17202: It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.${prompt}
  17203: Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17204: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  17205: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  17206: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17207: You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  17208: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?${prompt}
  17209: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Play ghosts!?${prompt}
  17210: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  17211: |-
    I'll get straight to the point, then.
    We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  17212: Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  17213: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  17214: We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.${prompt}
  17215: We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?${prompt}
  17216: That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  17217: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  17218: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17219: |-
    Thank you!
    Now, there is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  17220: The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.${prompt}
  17221: But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.${prompt}
  17222: 'Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season''s parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.${prompt}'
  17223: You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?${prompt}
  17224: Good luck!${prompt}
  17225: Excellent job, ${name-player}! You've done the witches proud.${prompt}
  17226: Here's the reward I promised.${prompt}
  17227: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  17228: Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!${prompt}
  17229: Giving up the ghost, eh?${prompt}
  17230: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17231: You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?${prompt}
  17232: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?${prompt}
  17233: |-
    Heard about them?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not at all.${prompt}
  17234: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  17235: So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?${prompt}
  17236: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.${prompt}
  17237: There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.${prompt}
  17238: |-
    Sign up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right away!
    Not today.${prompt}
  17239: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17240: |-
    Wonderful.
    There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  17241: First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.${prompt}
  17242: Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!${prompt}
  17243: Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.${prompt}
  17244: You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.${prompt}
  17245: Good luck!${prompt}
  17246: How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?${prompt}
  17247: |-
    Either way, your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  17248: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  17249: Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  17250: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your duties?${prompt}
  17251: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.${prompt}
  17252: You are to join with Maryse's congregation.${prompt}
  17253: I shall let you know when there is another opening.${prompt}
  17254: I'll let you know when a spot opens up.${prompt}
  17255: You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.${prompt}
  17256: Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!${prompt}
  17257: You can't stop now. You've just started!${prompt}
  17258: You've only just begun.${prompt}
  17259: There's still a long way to go.${prompt}
  17260: Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.${prompt}
  17261: Almost halfway...${prompt}
  17262: It's still a little too early to go back.${prompt}
  17263: Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.${prompt}
  17264: Just a little longer...${prompt}
  17265: You're almost done!${prompt}
  17266: Alright! It's time to collect your reward!${prompt}
  17267: You've joined the procession.${prompt}
  17268: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  17269: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Doing what?
    Not today.${prompt}
  17270: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  17271: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  17272: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  17273: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  17274: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  17275: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  17276: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  17277: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  17278: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  17279: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  17280: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  17281: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  17282: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  17283: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  17284: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  17285: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  17286: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  17287: Kupopo...${prompt}
  17288: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  17289: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'
  17290: 'Amazing! You''ve already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt}'
  17291: Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt}

  17293: 'Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt}'

    But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo...
    There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...${prompt}
  17305: Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!${prompt}
  17306: |-
    I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom.
    All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!${prompt}

  17345: You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.${prompt}
  17346: |-
    Why is that such a bad thing, you ask?
    By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.${prompt}
  17347: |-
    That must not be allowed to happen!
    If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!${prompt}

    And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either.
    She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.${prompt}
  17349: Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!${prompt}
  17350: And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!${prompt}
  17351: Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!${prompt}
  17352: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!

  17354: Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
  17355: Yes, my prince!
  17356: Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
  17357: Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
  17358: |-
    <Blush>...${wait-36: 2}
    Even if thine heart is what I desire, my prince?
  17359: |-
    Hahaha!
    My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
  17360: |-
    Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...
    I would know why thou dost love me so.
  17361: To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
  17362: Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
  17363: |-
    <Blush>...
    My...my prince...I know not what to say...
  17364: Prince Yahiko?

    <Blush>...
    It...it is nothing...
  17367: Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
  17368: Aaah... The Goddess is good indeed to deliver me a man of such regal persuasion. Praise be!
  17369: |-
    I beg your pardon, Your Highness. Hehehe...
    Far be it from one of my lowly post to make such a brazen request, might I trouble you for the pleasure of your company?
  17370: A-and who dost thou assume to be?
  17371: (Hmph, another shameless festival-goer who knows not where the line is drawn...)
  17372: Ahem! Citizen. That thy kind offer is extended with good intent is plain to see, but the prince hath prior engagements.
  17373: Hmph! Forgive this uneducated peasant girl her ignorance, O Lady Most High!
  17374: Well, Your Highness? Surely, a man of your royal upbringing knows that it is unseemly to keep a lady waiting.
  17375: Uh...if memory serveth me true, this way leadeth to the next standing position...
  17376: P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
  17377: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee!
  17378: Oh? Your Highness would make me his princess?
  17379: Y-yes! None other but thou art fit to be my bride!
  17380: Good Goddess... This inexplicable bout of amnesia nigh had me wed twice over! Confound my treacherous memory!
  17381: Your Highness toys with my feelings. Yet my heart will always belong to you.
  17382: |-
    Princess Amdina! My beloved!
    Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
  17383: |-
    Hmph!${wait-36: 2}
    <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
  17384: Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
  17385: Yes? May I help you?
  17386: While I'm flattered by your attention, distance grows between me and my prize while I engage in idle conversation.
  17387: There will come a time when we two can exchange pleasantries over a steaming pot of San d'Orian tea, but it is not today. I take my leave of you.
  17388: (The trickiest part in the routine fast approaches... Will I be able to survive it unscathed?)
  17389: (But of course! I've rehearsed often enough to be able to perform the entire routine blindfolded!)
  17390: (Oh, of all the times to be suffering from an acting slump...)
  17391: (Did Amdina truly love Yahiko? The princess as she is portrayed in the tale is one thing, but reality could well be different...)
  17392: (But then again, a love that unites the people of two warring nations couldn't be any less than the truest love of all.)
  17393: (This is surely but another tale grossly embellished for commercial purposes. It shames me to be a part of this blatant moneymaking machine...)
  17394: (It feels...uncannily natural to be playing this role. Could it be that I was the princess in a past life?)
  17395: (All hail Her Royal Highness, Princess Amdina!)
  17396: (But then again, I couldn't hold a candle to the gorgeous actress performing the role in Bastok...)
  17397: (Never before had I dreamed that acting could be so uplifting an experience. It's as though I was born to entertain!)
  17398: (Etch me now into your memory, San d'Oria, for the humble actress whom you behold this day shall tomorrow become an intercontinental star!)
  17399: (But then again, what future could there possibly be for an unremarkable actress such as myself in this cutthroat world?)
  17400: (Do my eyes deceive me? It-it's that world-famous theatrical director! Could he perchance have come here to observe my performance?)
  17401: (He's staring straight at me--there's no mistaking it! What more of a blessing from the Goddess do I need than this? The time has come for me to shine!)
  17402: (But then again, why would a person of his standing travel all the way here for me, a nameless actress? It's naught but a coincidence...)
  17403: (The crowd's turnout today is depressingly poor...)
  17404: (On second thought, it's merely a quiet time of day. I shouldn't read so deeply into it.)
  17405: (To think that I poured my heart into preparing for this role only to be met with indifference...)
  17406: (Is he truly the experienced actor that he purports to be? Every line he spits out sounds so...forced.)
  17407: (All the same, it cannot be denied that he is giving it his all. I suppose it's a trifle early to dismiss him.)
  17408: (What twisted series of incidents could have led to his being chosen for the role?)
  17409: (Hasn't it occurred to anyone that this whole event makes mock of a historically significant tale?)
  17410: (But then again, it can be said that it serves to preserve knowledge and interest in classic literature. In the end, is that not the most important thing of all?)
  17411: (With what madness was I taken to have agreed to this role? I feel so tainted to be party to this...)
  17412: (My throat grows hoarse from all this repetition...)
  17413: (But then again, a clear, resonant voice comes not from the throat, but the stomach. I needn't fret.)
  17414: (Uhngh... My voice...won't carry...like this...)
  17415: (Rumors of my co-star's insufferable womanizing habits have been battering my ears without cease.)
  17416: (But whatever the truth may be, allowing my mind to stray to such irrelevant thoughts in the midst of a performance serves me not in the least.)
  17417: (To think that I've been paired with a loathsome man such as he...)
  17418: (Ack... Every excruciating second spent beside this walking, talking embodiment of incompetence drives me closer to insanity. Best I leave now and preserve what's still intact of my mind.)
  17419: |-
    Princess Amdina!
    Whither dost thou go?
  17420: |-
    My princess...
    If thou findest my company to thy liking no longer, thou needest but voice thy mind, for thine every wish is my command.
  17421: (Well, fancy that. I hadn't expected anything resembling ad-libbing from this one. This warrants a second chance.)
  17422: '''Tis but a simple misunderstanding, my sweet prince. I would have thee join me hither, if it pleaseth thee.'
  17423: Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
  17424: There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
  17425: As long as I live, no harm shall ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
  17426: I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
  17427: Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
  17428: There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
  17429: Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
  17430: My perfect prince... <Sigh>
  17431: The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
  17432: I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
  17433: Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
  17434: <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
  17435: Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
  17436: |-
    I beseech thee, loyal citizen!
    Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
  17437: You honor us with your esteemed presence, noble adventurer. Do stay a while and enjoy the hospitality of our fair nation.
  17438: My patience has reached its limit. I'll be part of this farce no longer. You're on your own.
  17439: Wh-wh-what!?
  17440: 'A parting word of advice before I take my leave of you: You would do well to invest your...talents...in an alternate branch of entertainment. Such as mime artistry, for example.'
  17441: No! W-wait!
  17442: |-
    Oh, darn... Talk about being put on the spot...
    A-ahem! That concludes the show, folks! We look forward to your company again next time! <Sigh>...
  17443: Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
  17444: Nor I, my dear princess.
  17445: It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.${prompt}
  17446: We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.${prompt}

    Right, Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?
  17504: Mwahahahaha!
  17505: Who's there!?
  17506: Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?
  17507: Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!
  17508: |-
    Oho, but wipe I will!${wait-36: 1}
    Uka, come!
  17509: I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.
  17510: N-no!
  17511: Snap this little twig in two.
  17512: By your command.
  17513: Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?
  17514: We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.
  17515: Eeep!
  17516: Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!
  17517: Diva!
  17518: Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!
  17519: And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!
  17520: |-
    W-wait...
    Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?
  17521: Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!
  17522: Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!
  17523: C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!
  17524: Grk...
  17525: Keep at it!
  17526: Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!
  17527: Neo Crystal Jig!!!
  17528: Super Crusher Jig!!!
  17529: Shining Summer Samba!!!
  17530: Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!
  17531: |-
    Urgh...
    It's my turrrn, now!
  17532: Ouchies!
  17533: Please, I need your help!
  17534: Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?
  17535: Mumor!
  17536: |-
    Mwahahaha!
    And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--not with a bang, but a whimper!
  17537: Never shall any in this land know fun again!
  17538: Noooooo...!
  17539: And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.
  17540: The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!
  17541: M-Mumor? What...happened?
  17542: Impossible!
  17543: Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!
  17544: Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!
  17545: But don't rest on your laurels just yet!
  17546: He's...he's a person!?
  17547: Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.
  17548: But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.
  17549: Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
  17550: No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
  17551: That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
  17552: Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
  17553: Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her “Dancing Force” without the need of any outward shows of support!
  17554: Hmph. You two are pathetic.
  17555: Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!♪
  17556: But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!♪
  17557: The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!♪
  17558: 'And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!♪'
  17559: Wh-what is the meaning of--!
  17560: Now's our chance, Mumor!
  17561: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
  17562: We'll dance to the abyss and back!
  17563: Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
  17564: Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
  17565: Graaaaaaaaah!!!
  17566: We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
  17567: H-how could I...?
  17568: Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
  17569: You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
  17570: Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
  17571: One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
  17572: C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
  17573: Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
  17574: You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
  17575: Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what “fun” is?
  17576: Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time... I'm finally going to sing!
  17577: M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!

  17583: Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
  17584: My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
  17585: Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
  17586: Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!

  17627: '...We''ll sing and twist until the sun shines through!${prompt}'
  17628: Yes, that's perfect!♪${prompt}
  17629: Wow! It's like I came up with it myself!${prompt}
  17630: Now we can be together all year round, not just at the Sunbreeze Festival!${prompt}
  17631: |-
    /歌はステージでしか
    But as friends, not as performer and fan. I've got to keep my voice pristine for next year!★${prompt}
  17632: A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.${prompt}
  17633: As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.${prompt}
  17634: Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.${prompt}
  17635: /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive effect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.${prompt}
  17636: When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!${prompt}
  17637: Her dances include the following:${prompt}
  17638: |-
    Shining Summer Samba:
    /dance1
    Lovely Miracle Waltz:
    /dance2${prompt}
  17639: |-
    Neo Crystal Jig:
    /dance3
    Super Crusher Jig:
    /dance4${prompt}
  17640: That should cover it.${prompt}
  17641: Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.${prompt}
  17642: So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!${prompt}
  17643: We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!${prompt}
  17644: That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!${prompt}
  17645: A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!${prompt}
  17646: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt}
  17647: |-
    Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!
    These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  17648: |-
    And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...
    I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt}
  17649: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!
    Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!
    (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt}
  17650: |-
    It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.
    Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt}
  17651: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt}
  17652: |-
    And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.
    Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt}
  17653: |-
    And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.
    Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt}
  17654: |-
    And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.
    Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt}
  17655: |-
    Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!
    ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt}
  17656: |-
    It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!
    Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt}
  17657: |-
    Wonderful work, warden of weal!
    However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt}
  17658: |-
    The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.
    Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt}
  17659: |-
    Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!
    Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.
    We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  17660: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt}
  17661: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt}
  17662: |-
    I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?
    Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt}
  17663: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?
    We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt}
  17664: |-
    What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!
    We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt}
  17665: |-
    Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?
    The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt}
  17666: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt}
  17667: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  17668: |-
    Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy!
    Me nose holes smell the joy,
    The joy from happy toy!
    Wheeere cooould iiit beee?♪
  17669: |-
    This for me? In-doo-bid-ably!
    Could be gooder, but it not bad.
  17670: |-
    Waaah! It you!
    You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl]!
  17671: |-
    Not for us, not for me?
    I give it back. Now you happy?
    Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  17672: |-
    No no no no no!
    Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
  17673: '...'
  17674: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
  17675: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
  17676: |-
    For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?
    Me so happy head go boom! So boom!
    But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
  17677: |-
    Happy toy? For me?
    Why you give so good thing to me?
    But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
  17678: |-
    Blech. What this yucky thing?
    It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
  17679: |-
    What? But how...?
    If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!
    If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt}
  17680: |-
    Oh, I see. My apologies.
    How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt}
  17681: |-
    Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?
    I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt}
  17682: |-
    Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?
    I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt}
  17683: |-
    I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?
    Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.
    I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt}
  17684: |-
    Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...
    Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt}
  17685: |-
    What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?
    I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt}
  17686: |-
    I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.
    Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt}
  17687: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt}
  17688: |-
    How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?
    Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  17689: 'I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt}'
  17690: |-
    Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?
    At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt}
  17691: 'Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt}'
  17692: |-
    Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.
    I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?
    It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt}
  17693: |-
    Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?
    Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt}
  17694: |-
    What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?
    Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt}
  17695: |-
    'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail,
    A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.
    Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt}
  17696: |-
    While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.
    Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt}
  17697: |-
    'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made.
    Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt}
  17698: |-
    Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!
    To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt}
  17699: |-
    Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.
    Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt}
  17700: |-
    ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?
    Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.
    By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt}
  17701: 'As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17702: |-
    After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me?
    I truly-wuly want to know how ${entity: 0} reacts.${prompt}
  17703: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!
    I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt}
  17704: |-
    So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!
    Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}
  17705: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt}
  17706: |-
    You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!
    If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!
    You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt}
  17707: |-
    And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!
    Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt}
  17708: |-
    Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?
    Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt}
  17709: 'Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt}'
  17710: |-
    Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?
    Thanks for getting it back.${prompt}
  17711: 'Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt}'
  17712: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt}
  17713: |-
    I see you've returned.
    Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt}
  17714: |-
    What have we here? A cat burrrglar?
    How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt}
  17715: |-
    What am I talking about?
    That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt}
  17716: |-
    Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.
    Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt}
  17717: 'But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you''re done?${prompt}'
  17718: |-
    What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.
    Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!
    Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt}
  17719: |-
    A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!
    This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt}
  17720: |-
    I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!
    Thank you so much!${prompt}
  17721: |-
    And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.
    The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt}
  17722: 'Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt}'
  17723: |-
    Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?
    That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  17724: |-
    I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face.
    If you should see ${entity: 0} again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.${prompt}
  17725: 'What''s this? A present addressed to me from ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17726: How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.${prompt}
  17727: |-
    Would you be so kind as to tell ${entity: 0} that I truly appreciate the gift?
    I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.${prompt}
  17728: 'Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17729: |-
    What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long.
    I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.${prompt}
  17730: 'The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope ${entity: 0} would appreciate a succinct “Thank you.”${prompt}'
  17731: 'A present from...${entity: 0}? This isn''t one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?${prompt}'
  17732: |-
    Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy!
    Maybe ${entity: 0} has turned over a new leaf since we last met...${prompt}
  17733: Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!${prompt}
  17734: |-
    Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?
    What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt}
  17735: |-
    I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake?
    But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back! ${prompt}
  17736: |-
    No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.
    Anyway, please be sure to thank ${entity: 0} for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation.
    Ugh, I'm just terrible!${prompt}
  17737: 'Why would ${entity: 0} be sending me a gift? It''s not like there''s anything special going on.${prompt}'
  17738: |-
    The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.
    My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt}
  17739: |-
    I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.
    And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt}
  17740: "A present for me? \nI'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt}"
  17741: 'What? ${entity: 0} wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...${prompt}'
  17742: |-
    Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything!
    Just run back to ${entity: 0} and drop dead! This conversation never happened!${prompt}
  17743: 'You have received ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!'
  17744: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been taken!'
  17745: 'You handed over ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  17746: Have you had the opportunity to speak with Alaune down by the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria? She is said to be a veritable treasure trove of knowledge useful to adventurers like yourself.${prompt}
  17747: |-
    You there! Yes, you!
    Come here for a moment.${prompt}
  17748: You are a member of the Carpenters' Guild, are you not?${prompt}
  17749: |-
    The splinters in your hands told me as much.
    And your eyes tell me that you'd be just the one to aid a fellow guildswoman in her time of need...
    Am I right?${prompt}
  17750: I trust you've heard of the periodic timber survey conducted by our guild?${prompt}
  17751: |-
    'Tis a simple enough, if uninspiring affair.
    Travel to all regions with harvestable trees and ensure that there has been no deterioration in the quality of the timber.${prompt}
  17752: As guild tradition goes, I and my fellow greenhorns were tapped by the guildmaster for this tedious task.${prompt}
  17753: |-
    My overachieving guildmates have already submitted their reports, leaving only my assigned area--Jugner Forest--incomplete.
    But look at me! Armoires to assemble, bookshelves to build...
    I can scarcely afford a moment away from my sawhorse!${prompt}
  17754: |-
    Sadly, Grand Master Ulycille isn't hearing any of my excuses.
    Just look at her eyes! If I don't finish the survey soon, her quill pen dagger is going to coming flying through my skull like a nail through wood! At best, I'll be expelled from the guild.${prompt}
  17755: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I need you to travel to Jugner Forest and complete this survey for me.${prompt}
  17756: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    My pleasure!
    Not today.${prompt}
  17757: |-
    Hmph! Fine, then!
    Just don't expect any favors when you become old Ulycille's next target!${prompt}
  17758: |-
    Splendid! I knew I could count on a fellow carpenter.
    Now then, allow me to explain the details.${prompt}
  17759: As I said before, the task is quite simple.${prompt}
  17760: First, you must venture forth to Jugner Forest.${prompt}
  17761: 'Once there, you need only seek out the varieties of timber listed here on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, determine whether or not they can be harvested, and make note of the results.${prompt}'
  17762: 'Return to me with the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and one log of each type of timber you felled, and your task is complete!${prompt}'
  17763: "Easy as hammering a nail, is it not? \nSo are you ready to go forth?${prompt}"
  17764: |-
    Ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure am!
    Could you explain that again?${prompt}
  17765: |-
    What's the matter? Sawdust clogging your ears?
    Okay, but listen carefully this time.${prompt}
  17766: |-
    Wonderful! You're quite literally saving my life.
    Anyway, here's the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and a freshly sharpened ${item-singular: 1[2]} to aid you in your task.
    Best of luck to you!${prompt}
  17767: |-
    My future as a carpenter is in your hands.
    I know you won't let me down!${prompt}
  17768: 'Back so soon? Let''s take a look at your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  17769: Now let's see here...${prompt}
  17770: Excellent! You've completed the entire checklist!${prompt}
  17771: Needless to say, you remembered to bring back a sample of each type of timber, did you not?${prompt}
  17772: |-
    Almost there!
    Just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} remaining, and you'll be done.${prompt}

  17907: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  17908: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  17909: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  17910: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  17911: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  17912: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  17913: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  17914: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  17915: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  17916: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  17917: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  17918: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  17919: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  17920: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  17921: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17922: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  17923: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  17924: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  17925: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  17926: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  17927: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  17928: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  17929: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  17930: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17931: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  17932: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  17933: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  17934: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  17935: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  17936: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  17937: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  17938: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  17939: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  17940: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  17941: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  17942: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  17943: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  17944: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  17945: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  17946: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  17947: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  17948: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  17949: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  17950: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  17951: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  17952: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  17953: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  17954: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  17955: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  17956: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17957: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  17958: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  17959: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  17960: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  17961: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  17962: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  17963: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  17964: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  17965: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  17966: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  17967: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  17968: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  17969: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  17970: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  17971: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  17972: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  17973: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  17974: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  17975: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  17976: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  17977: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  17978: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  17979: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  17980: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  17981: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  17982: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  17983: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  17984: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  17985: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  17986: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  17987: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  17988: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  17989: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  17990: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  18006: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  18007: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}
  18008: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not today.
    Teach me!
    Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  18009: |-
    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  18010: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  18011: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  18012: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  18013: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  18014: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  18015: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  18016: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  18017: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  18018: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  18019: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  18020: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  18021: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  18022: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  18023: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  18024: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  18025: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  18026: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt}
  18027: Halt! You'd best have a good explanation why you're skulking about Chateau d'Oraguille, rabble.${prompt}
  18028: A letter? Hand that over this instant!${prompt}
  18029: |-
    I shall return in a moment.
    Wander not an ilm from where you stand!${prompt}
  18030: |-
    Monarlais Halver will see you.
    To the castle with you at once, and no detours!${prompt}
  18031: |-
    Well met, ${name-player}.
    How fare you these days?${prompt}
  18032: A letter? And this seal...${prompt}
  18033: |-
    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}

    ...So the serpent would seek the aid of the lion. A curious turn of events, indeed.
    I must deliver this to my king at once. Come along.${prompt}
  18035: An iron giant with the power to smite an airship from the sky, and a young Empress who would nonetheless seek to restore its power...${prompt}
  18036: '...${prompt}'
  18037: I would hear your counsel, Halver.${prompt}
  18038: Your Highness. I must confess, my heart misgives me as to the wisdom of this endeavor...${prompt}
  18039: Halver...!${prompt}
  18040: This is the selfsame Empire, after all, that not so long ago did wield the power of this colossus against this Kingdom and our allies.${prompt}
  18041: |-
    That said, they have since made amends, and we have accepted their formal apology.
    To hold past misdeeds against them now would be most...unchivalrous...of us, would it not?${prompt}
  18042: '...And yet the past cannot be so readily forgotten.${prompt}'
  18043: Begging your pardon, my prince. I daresay that the mere fact that they seek our consent--rather than engaging in devious and furtive plots--shows that we deal no longer with the Silent Empire of old.${prompt}
  18044: |-
    Settle yourself, Halver.
    I said nothing of denying their plea.${prompt}
  18045: Forgive me, my prince. I spoke in haste.${prompt}
  18046: It is precisely because I remember well the past that I believe the Empire's plea to be sincere.${prompt}
  18047: |-
    It is clear this Empress Nashmeira truly intends to lead her nation to a new age.
    I have no doubt that she will prove a staunch ally worthy of our trust.${prompt}
  18048: Oho! Never did I think this day would come, but I must say...my brother has the right of it.${prompt}
  18049: Besides, were something to go amiss, the presence of ${name-player} here should suffice to keep matters in hand.${prompt}
  18050: I could not agree more, my king${prompt}
  18051: ${name-player} has served the Kingdom with loyalty and valor time and again.${prompt}
  18052: I, too, can vouch for this, Father.${prompt}
  18053: I have fought by ${name-player}'s side, and you will find no comrade more honorable.${prompt}
  18054: The Kingdom is safe in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] hands, Father.${prompt}
  18055: Very well.${prompt}
  18056: |-
    Halver and my sons present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}

  18059: Yes? Is there something you need?${prompt}
  18060: |-
    Do you have a question?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not really.
    About your father...
    About your grandfather...${prompt}
  18061: |-
    Father? He said he had business at the weaponseller's in the southern part of town.
    Are you an acquaintance of his?${prompt}
  18062: |-
    He's so engrossed in his blades that he's not given me a swordfighting lesson in weeks!
    At this rate, I shall never become a knight...${prompt}
  18063: |-
    I am loath to boast, but his knowledge of armor and weaponry is second to none in the Kingdom.
    Helbort often consults with him about rare orders.${prompt}
  18064: |-
    You've heard of Grandfather? That does not surprise me.
    He was, after all, an angler of no small repute.${prompt}
  18065: |-
    Why, in his younger days, he would rise at the crack of dawn, and hike through Jugner Forest to Lake Mechieume.
    There, he would lose himself in fishing until sunset. Remarkable devotion, is it not?${prompt}
  18066: |-
    Oh, would that I could go on such a fishing trip with my own father!
    Alas, it seems he did not inherit Grandfather's love for the sport...${prompt}
  18067: |-
    Be this your first visit to the cathedral?
    All of Altana's children are welcome here.${prompt}
  18068: Hmm? Pray excuse me, but I could not help but notice your interest in that man.${prompt}
  18069: |-
    His is a heart-rending tale. He seeks absolution for his callous treatment of a distraught young lady.
    As her name is unknown to him, he refers to her only as “the red-haired maiden.”${prompt}
  18070: |-
    Young man. Nary a day passes by that you are not here, offering words of prayer.
    Surely, such devotion shall not go unnoticed by the Goddess.${prompt}
  18071: <Sigh> I sincerely wish that it were so, friar. Then I might have peace in my heart once more...${prompt}
  18072: I shall return to adding my prayers to those of others.${prompt}
  18073: May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt}
  18074: You seek the young man from a moment ago? I'm made to understand he was headed for Laborman's Way.${prompt}
  18075: Hm? Aren't you the adventurer from the cathedral?${prompt}
  18076: |-
    You...wish to know more of the maiden?
    It appears my sad exploits have attained notoriety far and wide...${prompt}
  18077: |-
    Very well. I have no reason to conceal this from you.
    On the contrary, I welcome it that more people would know me for the contemptible wretch that I am.${prompt}
  18078: |-
    What!? That fair maiden...is your friend!?
    Please, you must tell me where I might find her!${prompt}
  18079: |-
    So not even you know of her whereabouts...
    I suppose there is no help for that.${prompt}
  18080: Allow me to recount my tale then, as promised.${prompt}
  18081: It all began the day past when I went to attend a sermon at the cathedral.${prompt}
  18082: That was when I first caught sight of her, as she stepped through the doors, bathed in the radiant light of morn.${prompt}
  18083: |-
    Trite though this must sound, never before had I laid eyes upon such fairness.
    I still remember well the ornament that adorned her fiery hair...${prompt}
  18084: |-
    But above all, I remember the deep sorrow that was graven upon her face.
    To simply imagine the pain that racked her gentle heart sent a dagger sliding through mine own.${prompt}
  18085: The intensity of my emotions was such that I could not help but reach out to her.${prompt}
  18086: B-beg pardons, my lady! If I might have a m-m-moment...${prompt}
  18087: Have we met?${prompt}
  18088: |-
    Um...uh... (Breathe, damn you! Breathe!)
    S-s-something weighs heavily on your mind, that much is p-p-plain to see.
    I should be honored to share that burden, if it p-p-please you.${prompt}
  18089: '''Tis kind of you to offer, but I would not presume to prevail upon a stranger.${prompt}'
  18090: No, I insist! If there is aught I might do to ease your p-p-pain, you need but ask!${prompt}
  18091: This is...highly unusual for me, but since you insist...${prompt}
  18092: For true!? You've no idea how much this m-m-means to me!${prompt}
  18093: |-
    To think that this vision of beauty would share with me her deepest hurts! I was above the moon with joy!
    That is, until she launched into her story...${prompt}
  18094: |-
    She claimed to be a “Champion of the Dawn,” possessed of the ability to travel to the past.
    Powerful enemies had come from an alternate reality, and she was battling against them to ensure the survival of our world.${prompt}
  18095: |-
    In the midst of the struggle, however, someone dear to her fell into enemy hands.
    And to compound matters, those who once cared for her lost all memory of her existence.${prompt}
  18096: <Sigh>... I consider myself worldly and well-traveled, but naught could've prepared me for the words that spilled from her lips.${prompt}
  18097: At some point in time--I cannot say exactly when--bemusement turned into amusement, and I decided that all of it was a great big fairy tale.${prompt}
  18098: I found myself staring at her wide-eyed, nodding dutifully as the events--each more fantastical and ridiculous than the last--were regaled to me in intricate detail.${prompt}
  18099: And then the guillotine fell. I did that which cannot be undone.${prompt}
  18100: Heaheaheaheahhh!!!${prompt}
  18101: H-hey! What's so funny!?${prompt}
  18102: M-mercy, my lady, but any more of this and my sides are like to burst!${prompt}
  18103: What!?${prompt}
  18104: I don't believe this! You beg me to share my burden, and I oblige you for what? To have you rain spittle on me with your laughter!?${prompt}
  18105: |-
    Hmph! That's right, it was all make-believe!
    That you derived such mirth from my tall tale made it worth the telling! I thank you for your precious time!${prompt}
  18106: Farewell...and Atomos take you!${prompt}
  18107: I must be either losing my mind or the biggest fool in the world to think it a good idea to pour my heart out to some boorish stranger.${prompt}
  18108: |-
    Atomo...what?
    M-my lady, where are you going?${prompt}
  18109: In hindsight, the graveness with which she told her story ought to have been plain as day, even to this blind dolt.${prompt}
  18110: |-
    Whether or not there was truth to her words was immaterial. The point is, she believed the genuineness of her tale.
    As such, it was utterly tactless of me--cruel, rather--to make light of her as I did.${prompt}
  18111: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a chance to see her again and beg forgiveness...${prompt}
  18112: |-
    You and I scarce know one another, but might I trouble you to...tell me her name?
    The truth is, I've not been able to sleep at night for want of this knowledge.${prompt}
  18113: In light of the grievous wrong I did your friend, I would not be surprised if you were to begrudge me this favor. Yet I must ask that you take pity on me.${prompt}
  18114: |-
    Tell him Lilisette's name?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye, the poor sod seems repentant.
    Nay, leave him to wallow in his misery.${prompt}
  18115: |-
    Lilisette...
    A beautiful name...${prompt}
  18116: P-please! I beg of you!${prompt}
  18117: I owe you a debt of gratitude.${prompt}
  18118: Having had this opportunity to talk to you, it feels as if the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders.${prompt}
  18119: May the Goddess bless you thrice over, kind adventurer.${prompt}
  18120: |-
    You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    However, it is far too small to house an adequate amount of energy. Alone, it serves no purpose.${prompt}
  18121: 'The tiny fragments of Lilisette''s memory meld together to form ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  18122: |-
    Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!

  18123: |-

    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  18125: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  18126: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  18127: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  18128: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  18129: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  18130: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  18131: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  18132: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  18133: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  18134: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  18135: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  18136: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  18137: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  18138: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  18139: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  18140: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  18141: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  18142: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

  18652: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  18653: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  18654: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  18655: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  18656: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  18657: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  18658: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  18659: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  18660: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  18661: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  18662: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  18663: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  18664: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  18665: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  18666: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  18667: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  18668: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  18669: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  18670: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  18671: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  18672: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  18673: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  18674: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  18675: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  18676: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  18677: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  18678: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  18679: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  18680: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  18681: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  18682: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  18683: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  18684: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  18685: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  18686: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  18687: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  18688: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  18689: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  18690: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  18691: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  18692: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  18693: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  18694: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  18695: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  18696: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  18697: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  18698: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  18699: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  18700: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  18701: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  18702: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  18703: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  18704: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  18705: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  18706: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  18707: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}
  18708: '${color-alt: 138}You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.'

  18729: In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt}

  18942: Oh, hello again. If you don't mind me asking, what is that shield you're carrying?${prompt}
  18943: Hmm... I can see that you've spoken with her already.${prompt}
  18944: Yes, I heard her tale about the shield that can enhance one's crafting ability. I'm not sure if I believe it or not, though...${prompt}
  18945: Although, if it's true, that would definitely make it a shield worth having.${prompt}
  18946: I know what you're capable of in our field, and if she picked you for this task, it must mean you've got what it takes to make this shield.${prompt}
  18947: First things first. Let's teach you the necessary recipe. I recommend that you commit it to memory.${prompt}
  18948: 'Very well then. The first ingredient you will need is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18949: 'Its purpose is to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'
  18950: I have actually received some notes on Craftsmanship that you should probably hear.${prompt}
  18951: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  18952: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  18953: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  18954: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  18955: That is all that it says.${prompt}
  18956: 'Once you''ve raised the Craftsmanship, please bring me the shield and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18957: 'Next, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, which can be obtained from Luren.${prompt}'
  18958: You have made a delivery or two before, yes? That's essentially what you need to do here to receive these items.${prompt}
  18959: Please speak to Luren if you require more information.${prompt}
  18960: That does it for the ingredients. Please show me the shield once you've upgraded it. I would like to see it.${prompt}
  18961: How is it that you managed to forget the recipe? Very well. Here is the list of ingredients again. Remember, true professionals do not need to hear things twice.${prompt}
  18962: You are where you are due to hard work and dedication. I have faith that you can do this.${prompt}
  18963: 'I see... With this, I think I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  18964: 'So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  18965: The ability to pour my soul into this shield and create a crystal from it... I have no idea how it works, but it is really quite fascinating.${prompt}
  18966: 'This is strange. In creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it somehow lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18967: 'In the end, that is not really a problem if you want to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you will need to bring the Craftsmanship back up if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  18968: However, I really doubt that you would ever lose such a valuable item.${prompt}
  18969: 'Impossible. You mean you actually managed to misplace the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  18970: 'Oh well. I will make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}'
  18971: You are a professional. As such, you need to make sure you take proper care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  18972: It looks like you made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  18973: Hmm... The shape is different, and I can feel a faint energy emanating from it... Although, it clearly is not complete just yet.${prompt}
  18974: No, you'll need to craft multiple times in order to get the best performance out of it. That's what she told me anyway.${prompt}
  18975: That reminds me, I'm supposed to mark the shield when it's finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt}
  18976: That should do it.${prompt}
  18977: Please take the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno for me.${prompt}
  18978: Oh, I also have regular deliveries for Luren. It would be quite helpful for training the newer members of the guild if you could help me with them.${prompt}
  18979: Thank you for coming. I already heard about why you are here.${prompt}
  18980: Let's get started then, shall we? Here is the recipe you'll need.${prompt}
  18981: Do you have any questions?${prompt}
  18982: 'Now, allow me to explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18983: 'Like with the aspis last time, you will need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  18984: However, you will need to work even harder to imbue your spirit into the shield this time, so it will probably take a while before you are successful.${prompt}
  18985: 'Once it reaches 100%, bring me the shield and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  18986: 'The next ingredient is the ${item-singular: 2[2]}. I''ve left it along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} you used last time with Luren.${prompt}'
  18987: 'Lastly, the ${item-singular: 4[2]}... I asked the A.M.A.N. to help me prepare some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  18988: 'You will receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you complete all of them.${prompt}'
  18989: That's it for the ingredients. You have a long and hard road ahead of you, but I have faith that you can handle it.${prompt}
  18990: I see you have increased the Craftsmanship to the necessary level.${prompt}
  18991: 'Wait a moment while I prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  18992: Yes, that turned out rather well, I must say.${prompt}
  18993: 'Hmm... Just like I thought, making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}'
  18994: Make sure you take good care of this item so you don't have to go through the whole process again.${prompt}
  18995: Look at the brilliant design of this shield. You can tell its quality just by looking at it. Of course, I expected nothing less from you.${prompt}
  18996: Furthermore, I can tell this shield's power is well beyond the previous one. Of course, it's still probably not enough for her though.${prompt}
  18997: Now, let me mark it for you to complete the process.${prompt}
  18998: There you go. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be finished.${prompt}
  18999: Don't worry, these things happen. Go and try the last objective one more time.${prompt}
  19000: It is nice to see you. Let's not waste any time. I shall teach you the new recipe.${prompt}
  19001: Hm? You already know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients?${prompt}
  19002: 'I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. As such...${prompt}'
  19003: Our guild has received a number of orders for some items, but they need to be crafted in front of the customer.${prompt}
  19004: You see, the customer wants to see our finest craftsmen at work up close and personal.${prompt}
  19005: There are some exceptions, but otherwise only items crafted near the customer will count.${prompt}
  19006: I also need you to gather the materials needed to craft the items. You're free to obtain them however you like.${prompt}
  19007: On that note, we have reached an agreement between the guilds that will let you use gil to buy certain items from each one that were not previously available.${prompt}
  19008: You can buy them from the crafting set vendor in each guild.${prompt}
  19009: However, each guild is free to set its own rules, so know that you might not always find what you are looking for.${prompt}

  19052: One more thing... I have prepared something for you in honor of your achievement.${prompt}
  19053: I look forward to seeing you develop your woodworking skills and create breathtaking new items that have never been seen before.${prompt}
  19054: '0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}'
  19055: Oh, greetings, my friend. Ahh, what's that shield you're holding?${prompt}
  19056: Hmm... It looks like you've had an audience with her.${prompt}
  19057: I heard the story of course. Supposedly, the shield can enhance a craftsman's abilities. I don't pretend to fathom how it works though.${prompt}
  19058: Although, if the stories are accurate, then I suppose I should probably try to learn more about it.${prompt}
  19059: I know as well as anybody how skilled you are. So if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you must have what it takes to make this shield.${prompt}
  19060: So then, shall we get started? First, I'll need to tell you the recipe. This is important, so try not to forget it.${prompt}
  19061: 'So, in order to complete the process, you''ll require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19062: 'Essentially, this enables you to bring the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'
  19063: I received these writings which cover the topic of Craftsmanship in finer detail. If you will allow me to read them to you...${prompt}
  19064: I hope you were able to comprehend that information to a satisfactory nature.${prompt}
  19065: 'Once the Craftsmanship rating is high enough, please come show it to me. I''ll create the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt}'
  19066: 'Next, you''ll require ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You will find that you can obtain them from Ore Guzzler.${prompt}'
  19067: I believe you have made deliveries for people before, yes? That is essentially what you will need to do here.${prompt}
  19068: You may speak to Ore Guzzler for more information on the subject.${prompt}
  19069: Those are the ingredients you will require. I ask that you show me the shield when it is finished. I am interested to see it with my own eyes.${prompt}
  19070: Are you trying to tell me that you've forgotten the recipe already? Very well. Here is the list again. Please do try to remember it.${prompt}
  19071: I was known for being quite talented in my day, yet even I must admit that you have surpassed me. I have faith that you will be able to complete this task.${prompt}
  19072: 'I see... With this, I can create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that you require.${prompt}'
  19073: 'So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  19074: The technique used to pour my soul into this shield and form a crystal is quite amazing. It is quite beyond my meager understanding.${prompt}
  19075: 'Hmm... It would appear that in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, we seem to have lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19076: 'That is not a problem if you wish to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you wish to create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} again, you will need to raise the Craftsmanship once more.${prompt}'
  19077: I know that you of all people would never lose something as important as this though.${prompt}
  19078: 'Are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  19079: 'Very well. I can make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  19080: You are supposed to be a professional. You must learn to take better care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  19081: It would appear that you have successfully made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  19082: Hmm... I can tell that it looks different, and can even feel its power. However, it does not seem to be finished yet.${prompt}
  19083: I'm sure you've probably heard, but you'll need to craft it multiple times in order to bring out its true potential.${prompt}
  19084: Oh, I almost forgot. You require some kind of proof that the work on the shield was finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt}
  19085: That should do it.${prompt}
  19086: Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  19087: By the way, I am always scheduling deliveries to Ore Guzzler. Please stop by and help out the guild if you get a chance.${prompt}
  19088: I have been waiting for your return. She told me about your task this time.${prompt}
  19089: First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so I do hope you can remember it.${prompt}
  19090: That's the recipe.${prompt}
  19091: 'The first ingredient you need to obtain is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19092: 'Does that name sound familiar? It should, you have used it before. This time, you''ll need to craft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19093: By doing so, the shield's Craftsmanship will gradually increase, just like last time.${prompt}
  19094: 'Once it reaches 100%, come bring it to me. We will be able to use the shield to obtain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19095: 'The next ingredient on the list is the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. I hope you haven''t forgotten this one either. I have given it along with the ${item-singular: 2[2]} to Ore Guzzler.${prompt}'
  19096: 'The final ingredient you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}, but for it, I needed to enlist the help of the A.M.A.N. They''ve prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.${prompt}'
  19097: 'You may refer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you have completed all of the objectives, you can get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  19098: That completes my explanation. Your technique is nearly equal to that of my own. As long as you are not overly confident, I have faith that you can complete this task.${prompt}
  19099: Very well, let's see what you have there.${prompt}
  19100: 'Yes, quite impressive. Now, I will prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  19101: Haha. Once again, it seems we have a rather magnificent crystal on our hands.${prompt}
  19102: 'Hmm... It appears that like before, the shield''s Craftsmanship drops when producing the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19103: It is no easy task to increase the shield's Craftsmanship. That is why I am certain you would never do anything foolish like lose this thing, right?${prompt}
  19104: Yes, this turned out quite impressive. I can see that you approached this task with the utmost seriousness.${prompt}
  19105: In fact, you can feel the increased power from this shield compared to the previous one. I am anxious to see how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  19106: Now, let me get you that marking you require.${prompt}
  19107: There you go. Simply show this marking to Mewk Chorosap and you will be done.${prompt}
  19108: 'I suppose these things happen. Very well. You can attempt the final objective one more time. Once you clear it, I will give you the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19109: Oh, it's you again. I suppose you are here about the shield.${prompt}
  19110: I can see that you have already heard about the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt}
  19111: 'You just need to learn about the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}, I suppose. Very well then.${prompt}'
  19112: The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various items recently, but the items need to be made in the customer's presence.${prompt}
  19113: It's the customer's personal request, so I suppose it is in order to keep an eye on the final quality. The customers sure are getting picky lately, but that's the cost of doing business.${prompt}
  19114: So they will only accept what they can see you craft. However, an exception is made for items such as those used for repairs. You can simply deliver them directly without any problems.${prompt}
  19115: I also need you to gather the materials needed to make the items. I do not care how you obtain them.${prompt}
  19116: Oh, one more thing. An agreement was recently formed between the guilds enabling you to purchase some items that were previously unavailable, assuming you can afford them that is.${prompt}
  19117: You can speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. It may prove quite useful in your endeavors.${prompt}
  19118: However, each guild plays by its own rules. You may or may not find what it is you need. Be sure to keep that in mind.${prompt}
  19119: 'Once you have completed all of the requests, come see me and I will give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  19120: 'This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'
  19121: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You will find him in front of the Auction House.${prompt}'

  19135: Well? Are you rested and ready to get back to work? I can definitely use your help.${prompt}
  19136: Ahh, it seems you have completed the delivery. Thank you for the help.${prompt}
  19137: Ahh, I see you finished the final delivery. I cannot thank you enough for the assistance.${prompt}
  19138: 'Here you go. This ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} are for you, just as I promised.${prompt}'
  19139: If you ever need more, you can trade guild points for them at any time.${prompt}
  19140: This has gotten to be almost too easy.${prompt}
  19141: Hmm... So this is what the shield is like this time around.${prompt}
  19142: It never ceases to amaze me. It is surprisingly light despite its sheer size. It is rather unfortunate that it isn't designed for use in battle.${prompt}
  19143: She seems to think that the next upgrade will unlock the true power of the shield. I imagine you are looking forward to that just as much as I am.${prompt}
  19144: Oh, wait a moment. Would you like to give this crafting technique a try? I have a feeling that one of your skill can use it to make some new equipment.${prompt}
  19145: It is good to see you. I imagine you are here to learn about the final upgrade for your shield.${prompt}
  19146: First, you will need to learn how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  19147: 'In regards to the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  19148: I have left them with Ore Guzzler. You are perhaps the last person that I need to explain this to, but they can be exchanged for crafter points.${prompt}
  19149: 'As for the ${item-singular: 1[2]}... It is the same procedure as usual. Please bring me your shield once you have boosted its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  19150: That covers the explanation for obtaining the materials. Get out there and start boosting that Craftsmanship rating. I will be waiting here for you when you finish.${prompt}
  19151: 'Have you heard? It seems Mewk Chorosap is requesting the ${item-singular: 0[2]} created by this process. You should take it to her.${prompt}'
  19152: Greetings. Can I help you with something?${prompt}
  19153: Hm... That is the item requested by that Tarutaru from Adoulin. It was finished just a little while ago.${prompt}
  19154: However, she wanted it sent to Jeuno once it was complete, so I have already sent it off.${prompt}
  19155: I imagine it must have been delivered to Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno by now. You should go there and see for yourself.${prompt}
  19156: 'Ah, it is you again. I imagine if you are here, it must be in regards to the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, no? I just noticed it hanging on the wall of the guild recently.${prompt}'
  19157: This is what you are looking for, yes? Consider it yours for the taking.${prompt}
  19158: Oh! So this is what the completed shield looks like!${prompt}
  19159: The feeling of quality and weight to it... And you can feel the soul that was poured into creating this emblem... This truly is an immaculate piece.${prompt}
  19160: In fact, just looking at it has inspired me to take on all-new challenges with my work. I feel like I am a young man again. Hahaha!${prompt}
  19161: Yes, you did a fine job indeed. Now, I would like to teach you a new crafting technique.${prompt}
